Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to assess the living conditions and well-being of Mr. Khalili and his children, given the case severity of urgent need due to a parent with substance use disorder. The aim was to evaluate the current situation, identify risks, and provide recommendations for necessary support services.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, it was evident that the living conditions were substandard, with signs of neglect and disorganization throughout the apartment. Mr. Khalili appeared agitated and had difficulty maintaining eye contact during our conversation. His children, aged 7 and 10, seemed withdrawn and anxious. The older child shared concerns about their parent's substance use, which was confirmed by observing paraphernalia in plain sight.

Assessment:
The current living conditions pose a significant risk to the well-being of Mr. Khalili's children, who are already displaying signs of emotional distress due to their parent's substance use disorder. The urgency of this case is further emphasized by the visible signs of neglect and disorganization within the household.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
Immediate action is required to ensure the safety and well-being of Mr. Khalili's children. It is recommended that social services collaborate with local law enforcement to remove the substance from the household and provide temporary housing for the family. Additionally, referrals should be made to a substance abuse treatment program for Mr. Khalili, as well as mental health support for his children. A follow-up visit should be scheduled within two weeks to assess the progress of the family's situation and adjust support services accordingly.

It is crucial that we act swiftly to address this urgent case and ensure the best possible outcome for Mr. Khalili and his children. Their well-being must remain our top priority as they navigate their integration into Finnish society.
