Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct a disability support assessment for Ms. Sini Niemelä, who is the mother of an infant and resides with her parents in Lapinlahti. The assessment aimed to identify any specific needs or challenges that may arise due to potential disabilities and to develop a plan for providing appropriate support services.

Observations During the Visit:
During the visit, interactions with Ms. Niemelä revealed signs of mild developmental delay, particularly in her communication skills and fine motor coordination. The living conditions were generally clean and well-maintained, but there were some concerns regarding the safety and accessibility of the home for a person with potential disabilities. Emotionally, Ms. Niemelä appeared to be coping well with her situation, though she expressed feelings of frustration due to her difficulties in managing daily tasks independently.

Assessment:
Given the moderate case severity, it is essential to address the identified challenges and ensure that Ms. Niemelä receives the necessary support services to improve her quality of life and promote her independence. The family dynamics appear to be supportive, with Mr. and Mrs. Juhani Niemelä expressing a willingness to assist their daughter in any way possible. However, it is crucial to consider the potential impact of the situation on the entire household, particularly the infant's well-being.

2. Provide home modifications and adaptive equipment, such as ramps, grab bars, and specialized utensils, to improve safety and accessibility within the household.
3. Connect Ms. Niemelä with local support groups and resources for individuals with developmental disabilities, including therapy services, job training programs, and social activities.
4. Schedule follow-up visits to monitor progress, address any emerging concerns, and adjust the support plan as needed.
5. Offer parenting support and resources to Mr. and Mrs. Juhani Niemelä to help them navigate their daughter's disability and ensure a nurturing environment for both mother and infant.
6. Collaborate with local child protective services to assess the impact of Ms. Niemelä's disability on the infant's well-being and address any potential risks or concerns.
