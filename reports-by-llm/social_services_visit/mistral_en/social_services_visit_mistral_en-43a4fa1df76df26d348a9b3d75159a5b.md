Summary of Visit Purpose:
The visit was conducted to verify the emergency housing arrangements for Mr. Elias Kivikoski, a youth who is aging out of the foster system. Given the high case severity, it was crucial to assess the living conditions and provide immediate support as necessary.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival at the provided address, I found that the apartment appeared well-maintained but sparsely furnished. Mr. Kivikoski welcomed me warmly and seemed anxious yet cooperative throughout the visit. He shared his concerns about managing independently after years in foster care, expressing feelings of isolation and uncertainty.

During our conversation, it became apparent that he lacked essential household items such as a bed, kitchenware, and personal hygiene products. Additionally, there were no signs of a stable income or employment, which further emphasized the need for immediate support.
