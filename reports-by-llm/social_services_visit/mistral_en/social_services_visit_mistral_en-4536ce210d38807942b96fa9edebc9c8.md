 Title: Social Services Visit Report - Unaccompanied Minor in Temporary Housing, Laitila, Finland (16.08.2024)

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to assess the youth mentoring program for an unaccompanied minor residing in temporary housing in Laitila, Finland. Given the high case severity, it is crucial to evaluate the effectiveness of the current support system and identify areas for improvement to ensure the well-being and successful integration of the minor.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival at the temporary housing facility, I was greeted by a friendly staff member who escorted me to meet the minor, identified as Elias Niemi (16 years old). Elias appeared somewhat reserved but engaged in our conversation willingly. The living conditions were clean and well-maintained, with essential amenities available. However, it was evident that Elias struggled with feelings of loneliness and isolation, which may be exacerbated by his status as an unaccompanied minor.

Assessment:
The high case severity is primarily due to the emotional distress experienced by Elias, who has been separated from his family and is adapting to a new environment. His feelings of loneliness and isolation are concerning, as they may negatively impact his mental health and overall well-being. It is essential to address these issues promptly to ensure that Elias receives the necessary emotional support during this critical period in his life.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Increase frequency of mentoring sessions to provide more consistent emotional support for Elias.
2. Refer Elias to a local youth group or club to help him build social connections and reduce feelings of isolation.
3. Collaborate with the temporary housing facility to ensure that Elias's living conditions remain comfortable and conducive to his well-being.
4. Schedule regular follow-up visits to monitor Elias's progress and adjust support services as needed.
5. Explore possibilities for family reunification or alternative long-term housing solutions, if appropriate.

In conclusion, the visit revealed that while living conditions are satisfactory, there is a need for increased emotional support for Elias. By implementing the recommended actions, we aim to improve his mental health and overall well-being, ultimately facilitating his successful integration into Finnish society.
