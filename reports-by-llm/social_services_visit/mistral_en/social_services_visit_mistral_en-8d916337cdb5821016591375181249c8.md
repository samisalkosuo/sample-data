 Visit Report

Visit Date: 12.01.2025
Location: Tuusula, Finland
Visit Type: Routine Family Wellbeing Visit
Household Composition: Single mother (Ms. Sari Kiviranta) with three children (Age 8, 6, and 4)
Case Severity: High

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this routine family wellbeing visit was to assess the living conditions, emotional state, and overall welfare of Ms. Kiviranta and her three children. Given the high case severity, it was crucial to evaluate potential risks and provide necessary support services to ensure the family's well-being.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, the living conditions appeared somewhat disorganized, with cluttered rooms and a noticeable lack of essential household items. Ms. Kiviranta seemed visibly stressed and overwhelmed during our conversation. The children were observed to be energetic but well-behaved throughout the visit. There were concerns regarding their nutrition, as they appeared undernourished and had limited access to fresh fruits and vegetables.

Assessment:
The high case severity is primarily due to the family's financial struggles, which have led to inadequate living conditions and potential nutritional deficiencies for the children. Ms. Kiviranta's emotional state suggests that she may be experiencing stress, anxiety, and burnout from managing the household on her own.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Immediate referral to a local food bank to address the family's nutritional needs.
2. Connection with a financial advisor to explore potential assistance programs and budgeting strategies.
3. Arrangement for home cleaning services to help alleviate some of the stress on Ms. Kiviranta.
4. Scheduled follow-up visit in two weeks to assess progress and adjust support services as needed.
5. Referral to a mental health professional for Ms. Kiviranta, if she is amenable, to address her emotional wellbeing.
6. Collaboration with the children's school to monitor their academic performance and provide additional resources if necessary.
