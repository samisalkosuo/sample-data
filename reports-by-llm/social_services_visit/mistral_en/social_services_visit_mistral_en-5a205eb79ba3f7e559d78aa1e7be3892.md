Location: Pori, Finland
Visit Type: Immigration Case Monitoring Visit

**Summary of Visit Purpose**

The purpose of this visit was to conduct an immigration case monitoring assessment for the household of Mr. and Mrs. Särkijärvi (residing at Mäkelänkatu 12, Pori) due to the high case severity. The visit aimed to evaluate the living conditions, family dynamics, and emotional state of the married couple and their four children in order to ensure their well-being and compliance with immigration regulations.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival, the Särkijärvi family welcomed us warmly. The living conditions were found to be modest but adequate, with a clean and organized home. The family appeared to be cooperative and open during our conversation.

The couple expressed concerns about their financial situation, as they are struggling to meet their basic needs while also covering the costs associated with their immigration process. Emotional stress was evident, particularly in Mrs. Särkijärvi, who seemed anxious about the future and the well-being of her children.

Notable concerns included a lack of fluency in Finnish among the family members, which may impact their ability to integrate into the local community and access essential services. Additionally, there were signs that the older children might be struggling academically due to language barriers.

**Assessment**

Given the high case severity, it is evident that the Särkijärvi family is facing significant challenges related to their immigration status, financial situation, and language barriers. The emotional stress experienced by the family, particularly Mrs. Särkijärvi, indicates a need for immediate support to alleviate their concerns and ensure their well-being.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. Referral to Financial Aid Services: To help alleviate the financial burden on the family, we recommend referring them to local financial aid services that can provide temporary assistance with basic needs.

2. Language Support Programs: Enrolling the family in language support programs will help improve their fluency in Finnish and facilitate integration into the community. This will also benefit the children's academic performance.

3. Mental Health Counseling: Given Mrs. Särkijärvi's emotional distress, it is recommended that she receives mental health counseling to address her anxiety and provide coping strategies for managing stress during this challenging period.

4. Regular Follow-ups: Due to the high case severity, regular follow-up visits will be necessary to monitor the family's progress and adjust support services as needed.

In conclusion, it is crucial that we continue to provide the Särkijärvi family with the necessary resources and support to help them navigate their immigration process, improve their financial situation, and integrate into the local community. By addressing these challenges, we can work towards ensuring the well-being of this vulnerable family.
