 Visit Report: Safety Plan Monitoring Visit - 11.04.2025

Location: Juuka, Finland
Visit Type: Safety Plan Monitoring Visit

Client Information:
Name: Elias Kivikoski
Address: MÃ¤ntylahdenkatu 23 A, 76900 Juuka, Finland

Case Context: Unaccompanied minor in temporary housing with critical case severity.

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to assess the safety and well-being of Elias Kivikoski, an unaccompanied minor currently residing in temporary housing, as part of our ongoing safety plan monitoring. Given the critical case severity, it is essential to ensure that appropriate measures are in place to protect Elias from potential harm.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival at the temporary housing facility, I was greeted by Elias who appeared calm and cooperative. The living conditions were clean and well-maintained, with adequate furniture and personal belongings. Elias shared that he has been adjusting well to his new environment, but expressed concerns about missing his family back home. He also mentioned feeling isolated at times due to the language barrier and lack of familiar faces.

During our conversation, I observed that Elias was open and honest in discussing his feelings and experiences. He demonstrated a good understanding of the safety plan procedures and seemed to be following them diligently. However, there were signs of stress and anxiety, particularly when discussing his family situation and the reasons for his displacement.

Assessment:
While Elias appears to be coping well in his temporary housing, the critical case severity indicates that he is still at risk due to his unaccompanied status and the traumatic circumstances leading to his displacement. The language barrier and lack of social support may exacerbate feelings of isolation and stress, potentially impacting his emotional well-being.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Continue monitoring Elias's safety and well-being through regular visits and check-ins.
2. Refer Elias to language classes and cultural orientation programs to help him integrate better into Finnish society.
3. Explore opportunities for Elias to connect with other unaccompanied minors or support groups to combat feelings of isolation.
4. Consider arranging counseling sessions to address any lingering emotional trauma and provide additional coping mechanisms.
5. Schedule a follow-up visit within two weeks to assess progress and adjust support services as needed.

It is crucial that we continue to prioritize Elias's safety and well-being, ensuring he receives the necessary resources and support during this challenging time.
