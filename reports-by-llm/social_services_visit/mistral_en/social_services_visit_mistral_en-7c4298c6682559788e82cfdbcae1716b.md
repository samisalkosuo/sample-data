 Visit Report: Emergency Housing Verification - 27.03.2025

Location: Jämsä, Finland

Client Name: Sini Mäkelä (21 years old) and her infant, residing at Kauppakatu 16, Apt. 4, Jämsä, Finland

Visit Purpose: The visit was conducted to verify the emergency housing arrangements for a teenage mother and her infant, due to the moderate case severity identified in our initial assessment.

Observations During the Visit: Upon arrival, Sini Mäkelä welcomed us warmly, accompanied by her parents who were present during the visit. The living conditions were modest but clean, with adequate space for the family of three. The infant appeared healthy and well-cared for, while Sini seemed visibly stressed but cooperative throughout the visit.

During our conversation, it became apparent that Sini was struggling to balance her responsibilities as a mother with her studies and household chores. Her parents have been providing emotional support and assistance with childcare, but their financial situation is strained due to unexpected medical expenses. This has led to increased tension within the household.

Assessment: The family's current living conditions are manageable, but the emotional stress and financial strain could potentially escalate if not addressed promptly. Sini's academic performance may suffer as a result of her increased responsibilities, which could further complicate their situation.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up: In light of the moderate case severity, we recommend the following actions:

1. Financial assistance: Provide temporary financial aid to alleviate the family's current medical expenses and help stabilize their living conditions.
2. Childcare support: Connect Sini with local childcare services that can provide additional support during her studies or work hours.
3. Counseling services: Offer counseling for both Sini and her parents to address emotional stress and improve family dynamics.
4. Follow-up visit: Schedule a follow-up visit within two months to assess the family's progress and adjust support services as needed.

By addressing these areas, we aim to reduce the family's financial burden, provide additional childcare support, and improve their emotional wellbeing, ultimately fostering a more stable living environment for Sini and her infant.
