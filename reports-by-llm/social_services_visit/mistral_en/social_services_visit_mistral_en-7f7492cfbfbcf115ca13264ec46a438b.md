 Visit Report: Routine Family Wellbeing Visit - 26.04.2025

Location: Sievi, Finland

Client: Saku Lappalainen (17 years old)
Address: M채kel채nkatu 3, 93800 Sievi

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this routine family wellbeing visit was to assess the welfare and school attendance issues of Saku Lappalainen, a teenager residing at M채kel채nkatu 3, Sievi. The visit aimed to identify any underlying factors contributing to his school attendance problems and provide recommendations for support services to improve his overall wellbeing.

Observations During the Visit:
During the visit, Saku was found to be living in a clean and well-maintained home with his parents. He appeared slightly withdrawn but engaged in conversation when prompted. The family reported that Saku has been experiencing difficulties maintaining consistent school attendance over the past few months. They expressed concern about his lack of motivation and potential emotional struggles, although they were unsure of the exact cause.

Assessment:
Given the low case severity, it is likely that Saku's school attendance issues are a result of internal factors such as stress, anxiety, or a lack of interest in his studies. The family dynamics appear to be supportive and cooperative, which reduces the risk of more severe problems arising. However, it is essential to address the root cause of Saku's school attendance issues to prevent any potential negative impacts on his future academic success and overall wellbeing.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Referral to a school counselor for an assessment and potential intervention to identify and address any emotional or motivational challenges that may be affecting Saku's school attendance.
2. Collaborate with the school to monitor Saku's progress and ensure consistent communication between all parties involved.
3. Schedule follow-up visits to assess the effectiveness of the recommended actions and adjust them as necessary.
4. Encourage open dialogue between Saku, his parents, and school staff to foster a supportive environment that addresses any concerns or issues promptly.
5. If necessary, explore additional resources such as mental health services or tutoring programs to further support Saku's wellbeing and academic success.
