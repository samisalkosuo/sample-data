Location: Mänttä-Vilppula, Finland
Visit Type: At-risk youth intervention visit

Client Information:
Name: Sini Kivimäki
Address: Kaupungintie 12, Apt. 3, Mänttä-Vilppula, 37600

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to assess the wellbeing of Sini Kivimäki, a woman recovering from domestic abuse, and her at-risk youth situation. The visit aimed to evaluate the current living conditions, emotional state, and identify any notable concerns or risks.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, Sini welcomed me warmly and allowed me access to her home. The living conditions were modest but clean, with signs of recent efforts to create a safe and comfortable environment for herself and her child. Sini appeared calm and focused during our conversation, displaying a strong desire to provide a stable life for her child.

However, there were concerns regarding the emotional wellbeing of her teenage son, who was observed to be withdrawn and exhibiting signs of distress. Sini acknowledged these behaviors but expressed difficulty in understanding their root cause or how best to support him.

Assessment:
Given the case severity of moderate, it is evident that Sini has made significant strides in her recovery from domestic abuse. However, her teenage son's emotional state and behavior indicate a need for further intervention and support. The risk of negative influences or reoccurrence of traumatic experiences remains, necessitating ongoing monitoring and assistance.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Referral to a child psychologist for Sini's son to address his emotional distress and help identify any underlying issues.
2. Continued support services for Sini, including counseling and financial aid, to ensure her continued recovery and stability.
3. Regular follow-ups every two weeks to monitor the progress of both Sini and her son, adjusting interventions as necessary.
4. Exploration of after-school activities or support groups for Sini's son to foster social interaction and emotional growth.
5. Collaboration with local schools to ensure appropriate academic support and resources are available for Sini's son.
