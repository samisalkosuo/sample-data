Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct an immigration case monitoring assessment for the Kivim채ki family, who have a history of chronic domestic violence. The visit aimed to evaluate the current living conditions and family dynamics, assess risks, and provide recommendations for necessary support services.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival at the residence, it was evident that the living conditions were substandard, with signs of neglect and disrepair. Sari appeared visibly anxious during our conversation but maintained eye contact and responded to questions coherently. The children seemed well-behaved but appeared withdrawn and hesitant to engage in conversation.

During the visit, Sari shared that she had recently separated from her abusive partner and was seeking assistance to secure permanent housing and employment. She expressed a strong desire to provide a safe and stable environment for her children. However, it was noted that Sari's emotional state remained fragile, and there were concerns about her ability to manage the challenges of independent living while also ensuring the well-being of her children.

Assessment:
The Kivim채ki family is currently at high risk due to their history of chronic domestic violence and the substandard living conditions observed during the visit. Sari's emotional state indicates a need for ongoing support, particularly in managing the transition to independent living. The children's withdrawn behavior suggests potential trauma or anxiety related to the domestic violence they have experienced.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Immediate referral to emergency housing services to ensure the family has safe and secure accommodation.
2. Connection with a social worker specializing in domestic violence cases to provide ongoing emotional support and assistance with securing permanent housing and employment.
3. Referral to child psychologist for the children to address any potential trauma or anxiety related to their experiences.
4. Regular follow-up visits to monitor progress, assess risks, and ensure that necessary support services are being effectively utilized.
5. Collaboration with local law enforcement to ensure the safety of the family and hold the abusive partner accountable for their actions.

It is crucial that the Kivim채ki family receives comprehensive support to address the complex issues they are facing and ensure their long-term well-being. The recommended actions aim to provide the necessary resources and assistance to help them overcome these challenges and build a safer, more stable future.
