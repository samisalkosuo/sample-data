Date: 11.11.2024

Client: Eero Saarinen (25 years old), Kauppakatu 7, 63800 Koski Tl, Finland

Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct a household financial hardship review for Mr. Eero Saarinen, who is currently transitioning out of the foster system. Given his unique circumstances and the potential challenges associated with independent living, it was crucial to assess his financial situation and provide necessary support.

Observations During the Visit:
During the visit, Mr. Saarinen demonstrated a cooperative and open demeanor. His living conditions were modest but clean, with essential amenities present. He shared that he has been actively seeking employment opportunities since leaving the foster system, but has yet to secure stable employment. Emotionally, Mr. Saarinen appeared resilient and determined, expressing a strong desire to become self-sufficient. However, concerns were raised regarding his limited financial resources and the potential impact on his wellbeing and ability to maintain independent living.

Assessment:
Given the low case severity, it is evident that Mr. Saarinen is managing his transition out of the foster system relatively well. However, the lack of stable employment and resulting financial hardship could potentially escalate if not addressed promptly. It is essential to provide support services to help him secure employment and manage his finances effectively.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Employment Support Services: Refer Mr. Saarinen to local job placement agencies that specialize in connecting individuals with employment opportunities suitable for their skillset and experience.
2. Financial Management Workshops: Enroll him in financial management workshops to help him budget effectively, manage debts, and make informed decisions about his financial future.
3. Regular Follow-ups: Schedule regular follow-up visits to monitor his progress, address any emerging concerns, and provide additional support as needed.
4. Emergency Fund Assistance: Consider providing a small emergency fund to help him cover unexpected expenses during this transitional period.

By addressing these areas of concern, we aim to ensure that Mr. Saarinen can successfully transition into independent living while maintaining his emotional wellbeing and financial stability.
