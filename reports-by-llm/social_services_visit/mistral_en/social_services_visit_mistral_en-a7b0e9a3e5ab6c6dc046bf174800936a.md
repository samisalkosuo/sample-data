 Visit Report: Routine Family Wellbeing Check - 09.06.2025

Location: Veteli, Finland

Client Name: Kaarina & Juhani Sorsa
Address: Mäkelänkatu 12, Veteli, Finland

Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this routine family wellbeing visit was to assess the overall welfare and safety of the Sorsa family, given the high case severity. The visit aimed to identify any immediate concerns, provide support, and discuss potential follow-up actions or referrals.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, the living conditions at the Sorsa residence were found to be substandard, with signs of neglect and disorganization evident throughout the home. The family consisted of Kaarina (38), Juhani (42), and their four children aged 6, 9, 11, and 14.

Interactions with the family members were strained, with visible tension between Kaarina and Juhani. The children appeared withdrawn and unkempt, displaying signs of emotional distress. Concerns regarding their nutrition and hygiene were noted, as well as a lack of appropriate supervision and structure in the household.

Assessment:
The current living conditions and family dynamics indicate a high level of stress within the Sorsa household. The substandard living environment may be contributing to the emotional distress observed among the children, while the strained relationship between Kaarina and Juhani could exacerbate the situation. The high case severity is warranted given these findings.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
Immediate action is required to address the substandard living conditions and ensure the safety and wellbeing of the Sorsa children. Social services will collaborate with local authorities to provide emergency housing, food assistance, and access to mental health support for both the parents and children.

A follow-up visit will be scheduled within two weeks to assess the family's progress and adjust support services as necessary. Additionally, a referral will be made to a family counselor to help improve communication and reduce tension between Kaarina and Juhani.

It is crucial that the Sorsa family receives ongoing support to address the underlying issues contributing to their current situation and ensure long-term stability for the children.
