Visit Date: 22.04.2025
Location: Heinola, Finland
Visit Type: Household Financial Hardship Review
Household Composition: Married couple (Mr. & Mrs. Sointu) with four children (Aino - 10 years, Elsa - 8 years, Urho - 6 years, and Eeva - 4 years)
Case Severity: High

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to assess the financial situation of the Sointu family, who have been identified as experiencing high levels of household financial hardship. The review aimed to understand the root causes of their financial distress, identify any immediate needs, and propose appropriate support services to alleviate their current predicament.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, it was evident that the Sointu family resides in a modest apartment located within a multi-unit building in central Heinola. The living conditions were generally clean but sparsely furnished, with worn-out furniture and limited personal belongings. The emotional state of both parents appeared to be strained, with visible signs of stress and fatigue.

During the conversation, it was revealed that Mr. Sointu had recently lost his job due to company downsizing, leaving the family without a primary source of income. Mrs. Sointu works part-time as a cleaner but earns an insufficient wage to cover their expenses. The family's financial difficulties have led to mounting debts and arrears on utility bills, putting them at risk of service disconnections.

Assessment:
The Sointu family is currently experiencing significant financial hardship due to the loss of Mr. Sointu's employment and insufficient income from Mrs. Sointu's part-time work. The high case severity is further compounded by mounting debts and arrears on utility bills, which pose an immediate threat to their living conditions.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Emergency Financial Assistance: Provide the Sointu family with immediate financial aid to cover essential expenses such as food, utilities, and rent until alternative income sources can be established.
2. Employment Support Services: Refer Mr. Sointu to local job placement agencies and vocational training programs to help him secure new employment opportunities.
3. Income Supplementation: Explore options for income supplementation or benefits that the family may qualify for, such as unemployment assistance or housing allowances.
4. Budgeting and Financial Management Workshops: Offer financial management workshops to help the Sointu family develop a budget, manage their debts, and make informed decisions about their financial future.
5. Follow-up Visit: Schedule a follow-up visit within two weeks to assess the family's progress in implementing the recommended actions and discuss any additional support needed.

In conclusion, the Sointu family is facing an urgent need for financial assistance due to their current employment situation and mounting debts. By providing emergency financial aid, employment support services, income supplementation, and budgeting workshops, we can help alleviate their immediate hardships and work towards a more stable future for this vulnerable household.
