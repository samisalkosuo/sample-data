 Visit Report: Parental Capacity Evaluation - Case Number FIN-250625-KUHMO-001

Visit Date: 25.06.2025
Location: Kuhmo, Finland

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct a parental capacity evaluation for the teenage mother, Miss Sari Mäki (19 years old), and her infant living with her parents at their residence in Kuhmo. The evaluation was initiated due to concerns regarding the young age of the mother and the potential impact on her ability to provide adequate care for her child.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, the household appeared well-maintained, with a clean and organized living space. Sari's parents were present during the visit and demonstrated supportive and nurturing behavior towards both their daughter and grandchild. Sari displayed a positive emotional state, expressing confidence in her ability to care for her infant. The mother-daughter relationship appeared strong, with clear communication and mutual respect evident.

Sari's parents have been actively involved in the care of their grandchild, providing additional support and assistance as needed. They expressed concern about Sari's age and the challenges she may face in raising a child at such a young age but were supportive of her decision to keep and care for her infant.

Assessment:
Given the low case severity, the living conditions, and the supportive family dynamics observed during the visit, it appears that Sari has the capacity to provide adequate care for her infant. Her parents' involvement and support are crucial in ensuring a stable environment for the child's growth and development. However, it is recommended that regular follow-ups continue to monitor the situation and address any potential concerns or challenges that may arise as Sari navigates young parenthood.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Continue regular visits to assess the ongoing wellbeing of both mother and child, with a focus on monitoring Sari's ability to manage her responsibilities as a parent.
2. Provide resources and support services for Sari, such as parenting classes, financial assistance, and access to healthcare services.
3. Encourage Sari to maintain open communication with her parents and seek their advice and support when needed.
4. Consider connecting Sari with a peer support group or mentor program to provide additional guidance and encouragement during this critical period of her life.
5. Schedule the next follow-up visit for 3 months from the date of this report, to assess progress and address any emerging concerns.
