 **Social Services Visit Report**

Visit Date: 08.02.2025
Location: Raahe, Finland
Visit Type: Family Reunification Progress Check

**Summary of Visit Purpose**

The purpose of this visit was to assess the progress of the family reunification process for the young couple, Mr. and Mrs. Kiviranta (address: Mannerheimintie 12, Raahe), who are expecting their first child. Given the moderate case severity, it is crucial to ensure that the family's living conditions and emotional well-being are conducive to a successful reunification and the upcoming parenthood.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival, both Mr. and Mrs. Kiviranta warmly welcomed the social worker into their home. The living space was clean and well-maintained, with essential furniture and appliances present. The couple appeared to be in good spirits, expressing excitement about the impending birth of their child.

However, during the conversation, it became apparent that Mr. Kiviranta has been struggling to find stable employment due to a lack of relevant work experience and Finnish language skills. This financial instability has caused some tension within the relationship, as Mrs. Kiviranta works part-time to support them both.

**Assessment**

The moderate case severity is primarily driven by the financial challenges faced by the young couple. The lack of stable income for Mr. Kiviranta may lead to increased stress and potential emotional distress, which could impact their ability to provide a nurturing environment for their child. It is essential to address this issue promptly to ensure a successful family reunification and support the well-being of both parents and the upcoming baby.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. Employment Support: Refer Mr. Kiviranta to local employment services that can help him acquire relevant work experience and improve his Finnish language skills, increasing his chances of finding stable employment.
2. Financial Assistance: Explore options for temporary financial assistance to alleviate some of the financial burden on the family during this transitional period.
3. Parenting Classes: Enroll Mr. and Mrs. Kiviranta in parenting classes to equip them with essential skills and knowledge needed for raising a child.
4. Regular Follow-ups: Schedule regular follow-up visits to monitor the progress of the family reunification process, address any emerging concerns, and provide ongoing support as needed.
