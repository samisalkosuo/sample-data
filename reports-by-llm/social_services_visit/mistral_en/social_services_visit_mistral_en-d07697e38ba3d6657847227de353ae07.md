Visit Date: 13.03.2025
Location: Alavus, Finland
Visit Type: Follow-up on school truancy report

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to follow up on a recent report regarding the truancy of a minor student residing at the household in question. The urgency of the case stems from the potential negative impact on the child's educational development and future prospects.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, I was greeted by Mr. and Mrs. Sointu (30 and 28 years old respectively), who appeared anxious but cooperative. Their living conditions were modest yet clean, with signs of anticipation for their upcoming parenthood evident throughout the home. The minor student, a 14-year-old girl named Emilia, was present during the visit. She initially seemed withdrawn but warmed up as the conversation progressed.

During our discussion, it became clear that Emilia had been struggling with school due to bullying and a lack of academic support at home. Both parents expressed concern about their daughter's truancy but were unsure of how to address the underlying issues. Emotions ran high as they shared their fears for Emilia's future and their own inability to help her.

Assessment:
The Sointu family is facing a challenging situation, with both school truancy and impending parenthood placing significant stress on the household. The case severity is justified given the potential long-term consequences for Emilia's education and emotional wellbeing. The family dynamics appear strained due to their inability to effectively support Emilia during this difficult time.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Immediate referral of Emilia to a counselor specializing in bullying and school-related issues to help her cope with the current situation and build resilience.
2. Connection with local educational resources, such as tutoring services or after-school programs, to provide additional academic support for Emilia.
3. Arrangement of parental support groups or workshops to equip Mr. and Mrs. Sointu with the necessary skills to better support their daughter and navigate the challenges of parenthood.
4. Follow-up visit within two weeks to assess progress, address any remaining concerns, and adjust recommendations as needed.
5. Continued monitoring of Emilia's school attendance and academic performance to ensure her educational needs are being met.
