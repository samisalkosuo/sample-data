 Visit Report: Child Visitation Supervision - 29.06.2025

Location: Marttila, Finland
Visit Type: Child Visitation Supervision
Household Composition: Mr. Jukka Kivimäki (Father) and his son, Elias (8 years old)
Case Severity: Critical

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The visit was conducted to monitor the well-being of Elias during supervised visits with his father, as part of ongoing efforts to ensure a safe and nurturing environment for the child. The critical case severity necessitates close scrutiny of the family dynamics and living conditions to address any potential risks or concerns that may impact Elias's welfare.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, the apartment appeared clean but somewhat sparsely furnished. Mr. Kivimäki greeted us warmly and seemed cooperative throughout the visit. However, during the interaction with his son, Elias displayed signs of anxiety and discomfort. The father's responses to Elias's emotional state were inconsistent, sometimes dismissive and at other times overly solicitous.

Assessment:
The critical case severity is indicative of a complex family situation that requires immediate attention. Mr. Kivimäki's interactions with his son suggest a need for support in developing effective parenting skills to foster a more secure attachment between father and child. The observed emotional distress in Elias may indicate ongoing trauma or stress, which necessitates further investigation and potential referrals to mental health services.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Refer Mr. Kivimäki for parenting support classes to help him better understand and respond to his son's emotional needs.
2. Arrange for a follow-up visit with Elias to assess his emotional well-being and monitor progress in the father-son relationship.
3. Collaborate with local mental health services to arrange an assessment for Elias, if necessary, to address any underlying issues contributing to his distress.
4. Continue supervised visits until a stable and nurturing environment can be consistently demonstrated by Mr. Kivimäki.
5. Regularly review the case and adjust recommendations as needed based on progress and ongoing assessments.
