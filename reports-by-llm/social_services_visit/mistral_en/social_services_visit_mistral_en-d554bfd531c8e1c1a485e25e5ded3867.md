 Title: Social Services Visit Report - Vårdö, Finland (12.02.2025)

Client: Mr. Juhani Kiviranta
Address: Mäkelänkatu 3A, 96400 Vårdö, Finland
Visit Type: Parenting Education Follow-up

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to assess the progress made by Mr. Juhani Kiviranta in his parenting education program, as part of his reintegration into society following a period of incarceration. Given the critical case severity, it is essential to ensure that Mr. Kiviranta is making significant strides towards becoming a responsible and nurturing parent.

Observations During the Visit:
During the visit, Mr. Kiviranta appeared calm and cooperative. The living conditions in his apartment were clean and well-maintained, with evidence of ongoing efforts to create a safe and stable environment for his child. Mr. Kiviranta demonstrated an understanding of the concepts discussed during parenting education sessions, but there were instances where he struggled to apply these principles in hypothetical scenarios.

Emotionally, Mr. Kiviranta expressed remorse for past actions and a strong desire to make amends and provide a better life for his child. However, there were moments of frustration and impatience when discussing the slow pace of progress in his rehabilitation process.

Assessment:
While Mr. Kiviranta has made some progress in his parenting education, the critical case severity necessitates continued monitoring and support. His emotional state suggests a genuine commitment to change, but there is still a need for improvement in applying learned concepts effectively. The risk of relapse remains high due to the nature of his past offenses and the challenges associated with reintegration.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
It is recommended that Mr. Kiviranta continue participating in the parenting education program, focusing on practical application of learned concepts. Additionally, ongoing counseling sessions may be beneficial to address any lingering emotional issues and provide additional support during this critical period of reintegration.

Given the progress made thus far, it is proposed that a follow-up visit be scheduled in four weeks to assess continued improvement and adjust support services as necessary. If significant progress is not observed by then, further discussions with relevant stakeholders, such as probation officers and child welfare services, will be necessary to ensure the best interests of the child are being met.

In conclusion, while Mr. Kiviranta has shown promise in his rehabilitation process, continued monitoring and support are essential to ensure a successful reintegration into society and the well-being of his child.
