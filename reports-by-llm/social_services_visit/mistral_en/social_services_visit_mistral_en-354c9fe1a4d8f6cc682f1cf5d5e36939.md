Location: Petäjävesi, Finland
Visit Type: Substance Abuse Support Visit
Client Name: Eero Järvinen
Client Address: Mäkelänkatu 23, Petäjävesi, 75600

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The visit was conducted to provide ongoing substance abuse support to Mr. Eero Järvinen, a client with a history of chronic domestic violence. The purpose of the visit was to assess his progress in recovery, monitor his living conditions, and discuss any challenges he may be facing in maintaining sobriety.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, the living environment appeared clean and orderly, suggesting that Mr. Järvinen has been making an effort to maintain a stable home. During our conversation, he displayed a cooperative attitude and was open about his struggles with substance abuse. Emotionally, he seemed stable but expressed concerns about triggers from his past that could potentially lead him back to substance use.

Assessment:
The case severity is currently low due to Mr. Järvinen's commitment to recovery and the improved living conditions. However, the history of chronic domestic violence indicates a need for ongoing support and monitoring to prevent relapses and ensure the safety of all family members.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
It is recommended that Mr. Järvinen continues with his current substance abuse treatment program and therapy sessions. Additionally, we suggest arranging regular check-ins to discuss any challenges he may be facing and provide additional support as needed. Given the history of domestic violence, it would also be beneficial for the family to participate in a family counseling program focused on conflict resolution and healthy communication.

The next scheduled visit will be in two months to assess progress and adjust support services as necessary. If any urgent concerns arise before the next visit, Mr. Järvinen has been provided with our after-hours contact information for immediate assistance.

In conclusion, while Mr. Eero Järvinen's case severity is currently low, ongoing support and monitoring are crucial to ensure his continued recovery and the safety of his family.
