Visit Type: Newborn and Infant Safety Visit
Household Composition: Elderly woman named Signe Laine, age 73, with early dementia symptoms
Case Severity: Moderate

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to assess the safety and well-being of a newborn in the household, given the presence of an elderly caregiver exhibiting early signs of dementia. The visit aimed to identify any potential risks or concerns related to the infant's environment and overall care, as well as to provide guidance and resources for Signe Laine to ensure the baby's safety and health.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, Signe Laine appeared friendly but slightly disoriented. The living conditions were clean and well-maintained, with a clear emphasis on organization. The infant's nursery was equipped with essential items such as a crib, changing table, and baby clothes. However, there were some safety concerns, including the absence of a functioning smoke detector and an unsecured window in the nursery. Signe Laine expressed concern about her ability to care for the infant due to her recent diagnosis of dementia.

Assessment:
Given the moderate case severity and the presence of early dementia symptoms, it is essential to address the safety concerns identified during the visit promptly. The absence of a functioning smoke detector poses a significant risk to both Signe Laine and the infant, while an unsecured window in the nursery could potentially lead to accidents. Additionally, Signe Laine's expressed concern about her ability to care for the infant indicates that additional support may be necessary to ensure the baby's well-being.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Install a functioning smoke detector in the household and provide education on fire safety.

3. Refer Signe Laine to local support services for individuals with dementia, including caregiver training and resources to help manage her condition while caring for the infant.
4. Schedule a follow-up visit within two weeks to assess the implementation of recommended actions and provide additional support as needed.
5. Collaborate with healthcare professionals involved in Signe Laine's care to ensure coordinated and comprehensive support for both Signe Laine and the infant.
