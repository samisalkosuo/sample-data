 Visit Report

Visit Date: 25.10.2024
Location: Mänttä-Vilppula, Finland
Visit Type: Juvenile Probation Compliance Visit

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to assess the compliance of the juvenile probation case (Client: Elias Kivimäki, age 16) and ensure that the conditions set forth by the court have been met. The visit aimed to evaluate the living conditions, emotional state, and behavior of both Elias and his family in their subsidized apartment.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, the Kivimäki family welcomed me warmly. The household consisted of five members: parents Anni and Jukka, and their children Elias, Aino (14), and Eero (10). The living conditions were clean and well-maintained, with a welcoming atmosphere.

Elias appeared to be in good spirits during our conversation. He openly discussed his progress in school and extracurricular activities, demonstrating a positive attitude towards his probation requirements. His parents also shared their observations of Elias's improvement, mentioning fewer disciplinary issues at home and school.

Assessment:
Given the low case severity, the Kivimäki family has shown significant progress in addressing the concerns that led to the juvenile probation. The living conditions were satisfactory, and both Elias and his parents demonstrated a cooperative attitude during our conversation. There were no notable concerns or red flags that would suggest a need for immediate intervention.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
Given the positive progress, it is recommended to continue monitoring Elias's probation compliance through regular visits. The next scheduled visit will be in 3 months, during which time we will assess his continued adherence to the court-ordered conditions and any additional support services that may be required.

In addition, I recommend referring Elias to a mentorship program at his school to provide him with further guidance and support as he continues to navigate adolescence. This program could help reinforce positive behaviors and ensure his continued success in academics and personal development.
