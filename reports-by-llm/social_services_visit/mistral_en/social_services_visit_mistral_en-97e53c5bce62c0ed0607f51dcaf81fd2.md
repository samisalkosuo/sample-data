 Visit Report: Child Visitation Supervision - 11.10.2024

Location: Muonio, Finland

Client: The Särkijärvi Family
Address: Keskuskatu 23, Muonio, 99600

Visit Purpose:
The visit was conducted as part of the child visitation supervision program due to a reported case of neglect within the household. The purpose of this visit was to assess the current living conditions and family dynamics, ensuring the safety and well-being of the children involved.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, both parents, Mr. and Mrs. Särkijärvi, were present and cooperative. The home appeared clean but somewhat cluttered, with a noticeable lack of age-appropriate toys for their two children (aged 5 and 7). Interactions between the family members seemed strained, with minimal verbal communication throughout the visit. The children appeared withdrawn and showed signs of emotional distress, often engaging in self-soothing behaviors such as rocking or thumb-sucking.

Assessment:
The reported case of neglect appears to be moderately severe, as evidenced by the children's emotional state and the lack of age-appropriate resources within the home. The strained family dynamics suggest a need for intervention to address underlying issues that may contribute to the neglectful behavior.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
It is recommended that the Särkijärvi family be referred to local social services for counseling and support. This could include parenting classes, family therapy, and resources for improving the living conditions within their home. Additionally, it would be beneficial to conduct regular follow-up visits to monitor progress and ensure the children's continued safety and well-being.

In light of the moderate case severity, it is crucial that these recommended actions are implemented promptly to prevent further deterioration of the family dynamics and the children's emotional health. Further reports will be submitted following each follow-up visit to document progress and adjust recommendations as necessary.
