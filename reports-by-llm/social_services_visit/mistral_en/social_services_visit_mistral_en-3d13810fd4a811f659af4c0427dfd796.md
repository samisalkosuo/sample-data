Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct an outreach assessment for Elias Kivimäki, a youth who is aging out of the foster care system and currently homeless. The critical case severity necessitated an immediate evaluation of his living conditions, emotional state, and identification of potential risks.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon locating Elias at a local park, it was evident that he appeared visibly distressed and disheveled. His living conditions were substandard, with no permanent shelter or access to basic necessities such as food, clothing, or personal hygiene facilities. Elias expressed feelings of isolation, hopelessness, and fear for his safety due to the unpredictable nature of his current situation. Notable concerns included a lack of support network, limited access to resources, and potential vulnerability to exploitation or abuse.

Assessment:
The critical case severity is confirmed based on Elias's living conditions, emotional state, and the identified risks. His isolation, hopelessness, and fear for his safety are indicative of a high-risk situation that requires immediate intervention. The lack of support network and resources further exacerbates the vulnerability he faces.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
Immediate action is required to address Elias's critical situation. Recommendations include securing emergency housing, providing access to basic necessities such as food, clothing, and personal hygiene facilities, and connecting him with mental health support services. Additionally, it is crucial to establish a long-term support network, including social workers, mentors, and potential employment opportunities.

A follow-up visit will be scheduled within the next 72 hours to assess the implementation of these recommendations and to provide ongoing support as needed. Further collaboration with local authorities, foster care services, and community organizations is essential to ensure Elias's safety and wellbeing moving forward.
