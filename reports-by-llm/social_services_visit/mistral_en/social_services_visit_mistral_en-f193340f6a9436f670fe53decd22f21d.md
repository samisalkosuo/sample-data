 **Social Services Visit Report**

Visit Date: 02.07.2025
Location: Kajaani, Finland
Visit Type: Juvenile Probation Compliance Visit

**Summary of Visit Purpose**

The purpose of this visit was to assess the progress and compliance of our client, Mr. Juhani Mäki (35), who is currently under juvenile probation for a moderate case severity offense. The visit aimed to evaluate his reintegration into society and ensure adherence to the terms of his probation.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival, Mr. Mäki greeted me warmly and allowed a thorough inspection of his residence. The living conditions were clean and well-maintained, with evidence of employment income being consistently utilized for household expenses. Mr. Mäki demonstrated a cooperative attitude throughout the visit, actively engaging in discussions about his progress and challenges.

During our conversation, it was apparent that Mr. Mäki has been making an effort to maintain positive relationships with his family and community. He expressed remorse for his past actions and a strong desire to move forward constructively. However, there were signs of stress and anxiety, which may be related to the ongoing probation and the pressure to maintain a stable lifestyle.

**Assessment**

Mr. Mäki's compliance with the terms of his probation has been satisfactory thus far. His living conditions and employment status indicate a commitment to rehabilitation and reintegration into society. However, the observed signs of stress and anxiety suggest that he may require additional support to manage the emotional challenges associated with his probation.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

Given Mr. Mäki's progress and the moderate case severity, it is recommended that we continue monitoring his situation closely. To address his emotional wellbeing, I suggest referring him to a local counseling service specializing in stress management for individuals undergoing probation. A follow-up visit will be scheduled within two months to assess the impact of this intervention and ensure continued compliance with the terms of his probation.

In conclusion, Mr. Mäki is making positive strides towards reintegrating into society following his rehabilitation. With the recommended support services, it is hoped that he will continue to progress and maintain a stable lifestyle moving forward.
