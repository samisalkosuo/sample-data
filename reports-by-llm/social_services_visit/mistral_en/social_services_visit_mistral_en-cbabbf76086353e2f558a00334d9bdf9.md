 Visit Report: Elderly Care Follow-up - 07.04.2025

Location: Nakkila, Finland
Visit Type: Elderly Care Follow-up
Household Composition: Family of five in subsidized apartment (Mr. and Mrs. Järvinen, aged 68 and 65 respectively, along with their three adult children - Anna, 32, Mikko, 30, and Sanna, 28)
Case Severity: Moderate

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct a follow-up on the elderly care services provided to Mr. and Mrs. Järvinen, in light of their ongoing health concerns and the family's need for support. The visit aimed to assess the current living conditions, evaluate the family dynamics, and discuss potential next steps or additional resources that may be required.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, the apartment was clean and well-maintained, with evidence of regular care provided by both family members and professional services. Mr. Järvinen appeared to be in a stable but frail condition, while Mrs. Järvinen displayed signs of mild dementia, requiring frequent reminders for daily tasks. The adult children seemed to be managing their responsibilities diligently, with visible concern for their parents' well-being.

During the visit, there was an open and cooperative dialogue between the family and myself regarding their concerns and challenges. The family expressed gratitude for the subsidized apartment and the services provided but voiced concerns about the increasing demands on their time and resources as their parents' health declines. Emotional strain was evident, particularly among Anna and Sanna, who shared feelings of guilt and exhaustion.

Assessment:
The current situation is moderate in severity, with the family demonstrating a strong commitment to caring for their elderly parents but struggling under the mounting pressures. The living conditions are satisfactory, and professional services appear to be effective thus far. However, the emotional well-being of the adult children is at risk due to the stress and strain associated with caregiving.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Referral to a local support group for caregivers to provide emotional support and resources for managing stress.
2. Explore options for respite care services, allowing the adult children temporary relief from their caregiving responsibilities.
3. Schedule regular follow-up visits to monitor the family's progress and adjust services as needed.
4. Collaborate with healthcare providers to ensure that Mr. and Mrs. Järvinen receive appropriate medical attention and that their care plan is up-to-date.
5. Encourage the family to prioritize self-care and seek assistance when necessary, emphasizing the importance of maintaining their own well-being in order to continue providing quality care for their parents.
