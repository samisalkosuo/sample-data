 Visit Report: Child Welfare Check - 22.05.2025

Location: Lapinlahti, Finland
Household Composition: Mrs. Sari Kiviranta (34) and newborn infant, Elias
Case Severity: High

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct a child welfare check on the recently born infant, Elias, due to the high case severity associated with his family's circumstances. The visit aimed to assess the living conditions, mother-child bonding, and overall wellbeing of both Mrs. Kiviranta and her newborn son.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival at the residence located on Mäkelänkatu 23, Lapinlahti, I was greeted by a visibly tired but cooperative Mrs. Kiviranta. The living conditions within the apartment were substandard, with signs of neglect and disorganization evident throughout. The infant's crib was situated in a cluttered room, and there were no baby-proofing measures in place.

During our conversation, Mrs. Kiviranta appeared anxious and overwhelmed, expressing concerns about her ability to care for Elias while managing her own mental health issues. She admitted to struggling with postpartum depression and a history of substance abuse, which has led to inconsistent parenting and potential risks for the infant's wellbeing.

Assessment:
The current living conditions and Mrs. Kiviranta's emotional state indicate that there are significant risks to Elias's safety and development. The high case severity is warranted given her history of substance abuse, mental health issues, and inadequate parenting skills. It is crucial to provide immediate support and resources to ensure the wellbeing of both mother and child.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Immediate referral for Mrs. Kiviranta to a local mental health clinic specializing in postpartum depression, as well as ongoing counseling and support services.
2. Home safety assessment and necessary improvements, including baby-proofing measures and decluttering the living space.
3. Enrollment of Elias in an early intervention program to address any developmental delays or concerns that may arise due to his mother's inconsistent care.
4. Regular follow-up visits to monitor progress, assess the effectiveness of interventions, and provide ongoing support as needed.
5. Collaboration with local social services, healthcare providers, and community resources to ensure a comprehensive and coordinated approach to addressing this family's needs.
