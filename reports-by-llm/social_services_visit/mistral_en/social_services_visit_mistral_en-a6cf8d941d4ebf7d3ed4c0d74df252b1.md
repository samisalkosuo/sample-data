 **Social Services Visit Report**

Visit Date: 01.04.2025
Location: Lemland, Finland (Address: Vuorimiehenkuja 2, 29630 Lemland)
Visit Type: Household Financial Hardship Review
Household Composition: Single Father (Mr. Juhani Kiviranta) with one child (10-year-old daughter, Emilia)
Case Severity: Low

**Summary of Visit Purpose**
The purpose of this visit was to assess the financial situation of Mr. Juhani Kiviranta and his daughter Emilia, following a report of potential household financial hardship. The visit aimed to identify any immediate needs, available resources, and potential support services that could alleviate their current circumstances.

**Observations During the Visit**
Upon arrival, I was warmly greeted by Mr. Kiviranta who appeared calm and cooperative throughout the visit. His living conditions were modest but clean, with a welcoming atmosphere. Emilia, his daughter, was present during the conversation and seemed well-adjusted and content.

Mr. Kiviranta shared that he had recently experienced a reduction in income due to job loss, which has put a strain on their household budget. He expressed concern about meeting basic necessities such as food and utilities while also ensuring Emilia's educational needs were met.

**Assessment**
Given the low case severity, it appears that Mr. Kiviranta is managing his situation admirably, considering the recent setback. However, the reduced income has created a temporary financial hardship that requires attention to prevent potential long-term consequences. The family dynamics appear stable, and there are no immediate risks or concerns regarding Emilia's wellbeing.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**
In light of the visit findings, it is recommended that Mr. Kiviranta be referred to the Lemland Unemployment Office for assistance in finding alternative employment opportunities. Additionally, he will be connected with a financial advisor from the Social Services department who can help create a budget plan and explore eligibility for temporary financial aid.

A follow-up visit will be scheduled within two weeks to assess progress and adjust recommendations as necessary. It is essential that Mr. Kiviranta maintains open communication with social services during this time to ensure the best possible outcome for his family.
