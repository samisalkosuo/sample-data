 Visit Report: Newborn and Infant Safety Visit

Visit Date: 06.07.2025
Location: Ähtäri, Finland

Client Name: Kaarina Kivijärvi (Grandmother) & Eero Kivijärvi (Grandfather)
Address: Metsänkartano 1, Ähtäri, 64900

Visit Purpose: The purpose of this visit was to assess the safety and well-being of the newborn grandchild residing with the grandparents, in accordance with the Newborn and Infant Safety Visit type. Given the moderate case severity, the focus was on ensuring a secure environment for the infant and addressing any potential risks or concerns that may impact the child's development.

Observations During the Visit: The visit began with warm greetings from Kaarina and Eero, who were eager to discuss their experiences as new grandparents. The living conditions appeared clean and well-maintained, with a designated space for the infant's belongings. However, there were some notable concerns regarding the safety of the home. For instance, the grandparents had not yet installed any baby gates or other childproofing measures to prevent access to potential hazards such as staircases and electrical outlets.

Emotionally, both Kaarina and Eero seemed genuinely fond of their grandchild but expressed some initial challenges in adapting to their new roles. They appeared open to learning more about infant care and safety practices. During the visit, it was evident that they had taken steps to educate themselves on basic infant needs, such as feeding and diaper changes.

Assessment: Given the moderate case severity, it is essential to address the identified safety concerns promptly to ensure the well-being of the newborn. While the grandparents demonstrated a willingness to learn and adapt, their lack of experience in caring for an infant may lead to unintentional risks if not properly addressed.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up: To mitigate the identified safety concerns, it is recommended that the social services provide the following support:

1. Childproofing materials (e.g., baby gates, outlet covers) to ensure a safe environment for the infant.
2. Referral to a local parenting support group or class to help the grandparents gain more confidence in their caregiving abilities and learn about best practices for infant safety and development.
3. Regular follow-up visits to monitor progress and address any additional concerns that may arise.
4. Provide resources on common challenges faced by new grandparents, such as adjusting to a changing family dynamic and maintaining open communication with the child's parents.

By addressing these recommendations, we can help ensure the well-being of the infant while supporting the grandparents in their role as caregivers.
