Visit Type: At-Risk Youth Intervention Visit

Client Information:
Name: Sauli & Liisa M채ki (Sauli M채ki, age 23; Liisa M채ki, age 21)
Address: Kauppakatu 4A, 00100 Helsinki

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct an at-risk youth intervention for the expectant couple, Sauli and Liisa M채ki. Given their young age and impending parenthood, it is essential to provide support and resources to ensure a smooth transition into parenthood and promote positive family dynamics.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, both Sauli and Liisa welcomed me warmly. The living conditions were clean and well-maintained, with evidence of ongoing efforts to prepare for their new addition. Sauli appeared anxious about the upcoming changes but showed a genuine desire to learn and grow as a father. Liisa, on the other hand, seemed more confident and composed, expressing excitement about motherhood.

During our conversation, it became apparent that both individuals were aware of the challenges they would face but lacked knowledge regarding childcare, budgeting, and parent-child communication. Emotional discussions revolved around concerns about their ability to balance work, school, and parenthood while maintaining a healthy relationship.

Assessment:
The case severity is low, as the couple demonstrates a willingness to learn and adapt. However, it is essential to address their knowledge gaps and provide resources to help them navigate the challenges of parenthood effectively. The emotional state of both individuals indicates that they may benefit from counseling sessions focused on stress management and communication skills.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Referral to a parenting education program to equip Sauli and Liisa with essential childcare knowledge, including infant care, budgeting, and time management.
2. Arrangement for counseling sessions to help the couple manage stress and improve communication skills.
3. Follow-up visit in 4 weeks to assess progress and provide additional support as needed.
4. Continued monitoring of the situation to ensure a smooth transition into parenthood and promote positive family dynamics.
