(Address redacted for privacy)

Visit Purpose:
The visit was conducted to review the support plan for Eero Järvinen, a teenager in foster care, due to the high case severity. The purpose of this meeting was to assess the progress made since the last review, discuss any challenges encountered, and make necessary adjustments to the current support plan to ensure Eero's well-being and successful integration into society.

Observations During the Visit:
During the visit, Eero displayed a mix of emotions, ranging from apprehension to openness. He shared his experiences in foster care, expressing feelings of loneliness and homesickness but also acknowledging the support he has received from his foster family. The living conditions were clean and well-maintained, with a welcoming atmosphere that fostered a sense of security for Eero.

Assessment:
Eero's case remains high severity due to the complex nature of his emotional struggles and the need for ongoing support. His feelings of loneliness and homesickness are indicative of the trauma he has experienced, which requires continued attention and care. The positive living conditions provide a stable foundation, but more focus is needed on addressing Eero's emotional needs and helping him build stronger relationships with his foster family and peers.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Increase the frequency of counseling sessions to help Eero cope with his emotions and work through his trauma.
2. Facilitate social activities for Eero, such as group outings or hobbies, to encourage him to build relationships with peers outside of school.
3. Organize family therapy sessions to improve communication and understanding between Eero and his foster family.
4. Schedule a follow-up visit in 3 months to reassess Eero's progress and make any necessary adjustments to the support plan.
5. Collaborate with Eero's school to ensure they are aware of his needs and can provide additional support if required.
6. Continue monitoring Eero's emotional state and living conditions, ensuring that he remains in a safe and supportive environment.
