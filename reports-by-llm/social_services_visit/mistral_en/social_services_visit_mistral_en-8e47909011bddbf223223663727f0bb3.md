 **Social Services Visit Report**

Visit Date: 14.07.2025
Location: Masku, Finland
Visit Type: Household Financial Hardship Review

**Summary of Visit Purpose**

The purpose of this visit was to assess the financial situation of the refugee family residing in temporary accommodation within Masku, Finland. The review aimed to identify any potential hardships and provide appropriate support to alleviate their financial difficulties.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at the designated residence, I was greeted by Mr. Ahmed Ali (35) and his family consisting of his wife, Fatima (30), and their three children: Aisha (8), Omar (6), and Hassan (4). The family appeared welcoming and open to discussing their financial situation.

The living conditions were modest but clean, with essential furniture provided by the temporary accommodation services. The family shared that they had been residing in this location for approximately three months following their arrival in Finland. Mr. Ali expressed concerns about finding stable employment due to language barriers and limited job opportunities in the area.

**Assessment**

Given the low case severity, it is evident that the family is currently managing their financial hardships reasonably well considering their recent relocation and integration into a new country. However, the lack of steady income poses a risk to their long-term stability and ability to secure permanent housing.

The emotional state of the family was generally positive, with a strong sense of resilience and determination to overcome their challenges. The children were well-behaved and appeared content in their temporary home.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

To address the family's financial hardships, I recommend the following:

1. Employment Support Services: Refer Mr. Ali to local employment agencies that specialize in assisting refugees with language barriers and job placement.
2. Financial Assistance: Explore eligibility for temporary financial aid to help cover basic living expenses until Mr. Ali secures employment.
3. Language Training: Enroll Mr. Ali in an intensive language course to improve his proficiency in Finnish, which will increase his chances of finding suitable employment.
4. Follow-up Visit: Schedule a follow-up visit within two months to assess the family's progress and adjust support services as needed.

By addressing these areas, we can help alleviate the financial hardships faced by this refugee family and facilitate their successful integration into Finnish society.
