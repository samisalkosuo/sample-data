Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this routine visit was to assess the wellbeing of Elias Kivimäki, an unaccompanied minor residing in temporary housing, and to provide ongoing support as part of our commitment to ensuring the safety and welfare of vulnerable individuals.

Assessment:
Given the low case severity, it is evident that Elias is coping well in his temporary housing arrangement.
