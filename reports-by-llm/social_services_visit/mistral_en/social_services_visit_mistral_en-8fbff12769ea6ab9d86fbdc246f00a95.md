 Visit Report: Social Services Case No. 25-KIR-001
Visit Date: 20.05.2025
Location: Kirkkonummi, Finland

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct a support plan review meeting for the two-parent household identified as Case No. 25-KIR-001, following reports of neglect. The visit aimed to assess the family's progress in addressing the reported issues and to discuss potential adjustments to the support plan if necessary.

Observations During the Visit:
The visit took place at the family's residence in Kirkkonummi. Both parents were present during the meeting, which was conducted in a respectful and cooperative manner. The living conditions appeared clean and safe, with no immediate concerns regarding the children's welfare. However, there were signs of stress and fatigue among both parents, suggesting that they may be struggling to balance their responsibilities.

Assessment:
Given the low case severity, it appears that the family is making a genuine effort to address the reported neglect. The clean and safe living conditions, coupled with the cooperative attitude during the meeting, indicate a willingness to improve. However, the signs of stress and fatigue suggest that additional support may be necessary to ensure the long-term wellbeing of both parents and children.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
It is recommended that the family continues to receive ongoing support from social services, with a focus on providing resources for stress management and parenting skills. Additionally, it would be beneficial to arrange for a home visit from a mental health professional to assess the need for further support in managing stress and addressing any underlying issues contributing to the reported neglect.

A follow-up meeting will be scheduled within two months to reassess the family's progress and adjust the support plan as necessary. The family has agreed to these recommendations and expressed gratitude for the continued support from social services.
