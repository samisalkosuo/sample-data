 Visit Report: Case Number FIN-250603-PAIMIO

Visit Date: 03.06.2025
Location: Paimio, Finland
Visit Type: Support Plan Review Meeting

Client Information:
Name: Sari Kivimäki (38 years old) and her two children, Emilia (12 years old) and Elias (9 years old)
Address: Mannerheimintie 5, Paimio, Finland

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct a support plan review meeting for the Kivimäki family, who have a history of chronic domestic violence. Given the case severity marked as urgent, it was crucial to assess the family's progress in implementing the previously established support plan and address any new concerns or challenges that may have arisen.

Observations During the Visit:
The visit took place at the Kivimäki family residence. Sari appeared visibly anxious during our initial interaction but was cooperative throughout the meeting. Emilia and Elias were present during parts of the discussion, demonstrating a noticeable improvement in their behavior compared to previous visits. The living conditions showed signs of improvement, with a cleaner and more organized home environment. However, there were still some indications of tension between Sari and her partner, which was a cause for concern.

Assessment:
While the Kivimäki family has made progress in addressing their living conditions, the ongoing domestic violence remains a significant risk factor. The emotional state of Sari and the children suggests that they continue to struggle with the impact of the abusive environment. It is essential to provide additional support services to help Sari navigate her relationship and ensure the safety and well-being of her children.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Increase the frequency of social worker visits to provide ongoing support and monitoring for the Kivimäki family.
2. Refer Sari to a local domestic violence support group to help her develop coping strategies and connect with other individuals in similar situations.
3. Arrange for counseling sessions for Emilia and Elias to address any emotional trauma they may have experienced.
4. Collaborate with local law enforcement to ensure that appropriate measures are in place to protect the Kivimäki family, should any incidents of domestic violence occur.
5. Schedule a follow-up visit within two weeks to assess the family's progress and adjust support services as needed.

It is crucial that we continue to work closely with the Kivimäki family to ensure their safety and well-being. The ongoing support and intervention provided by social services will play a vital role in helping them break the cycle of domestic violence and build a more secure future.
