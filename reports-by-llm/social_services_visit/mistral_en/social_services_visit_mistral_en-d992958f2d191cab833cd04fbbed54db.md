Eero appeared to be in good health, although he mentioned experiencing occasional bouts of anxiety related to his service experiences. Liisa expressed her concern for her father's emotional wellbeing and sought guidance on how best to support him.

Given the low case severity, it is evident that Eero and Liisa are managing their living situation effectively. However, the veteran's occasional anxiety warrants further attention due to its potential impact on his overall wellbeing. The daughter's proactive approach in seeking support indicates a strong family dynamic and willingness to address any issues that may arise.

1. Refer Eero Mäki to our counseling services for veterans, which focus on addressing mental health concerns related to military service.
2. Schedule regular follow-up visits with both Eero and Liisa to monitor progress and adjust support as needed.
3. Provide resources and information on local support groups for veterans and their families, encouraging Eero to engage in peer-to-peer discussions about his experiences.
4. Offer Liisa additional resources on caregiver support and stress management techniques to help her better assist her father while maintaining her own wellbeing.

In conclusion, this visit confirmed that our ongoing support services are beneficial for Eero Mäki and his family. By addressing the veteran's anxiety through counseling and providing resources for both Eero and Liisa, we can continue to ensure their wellbeing and promote a positive living environment.
