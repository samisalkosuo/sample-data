Visit Date: 13.08.2024
Location: Pelkosenniemi, Finland
Visit Type: Child Welfare Check
Household Composition: Ms. Sari Kiviranta (35 years old) recovering from domestic abuse
Case Severity: Moderate

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct a child welfare check on the household of Ms. Sari Kiviranta, who has recently disclosed experiencing domestic abuse. The visit aimed to assess the living conditions and emotional well-being of both Ms. Kiviranta and her minor child, as well as to evaluate the risks and family dynamics in light of the case severity.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, Ms. Kiviranta welcomed me warmly into her home located at Mets√§nkartano 2, Pelkosenniemi. The living conditions were clean and well-maintained, with a noticeable absence of any signs of physical abuse or distress. Ms. Kiviranta appeared calm and composed during our conversation, displaying a strong resolve to ensure her child's safety and well-being.

During the visit, I inquired about her current situation and emotional state. Ms. Kiviranta shared that she had recently left her abusive partner and was seeking support from local resources. She expressed gratitude for the services provided thus far but voiced concerns about potential repercussions and the safety of herself and her child.

Assessment:
The living conditions observed during the visit indicate a stable and safe environment for the child, with no immediate risks to their well-being. Ms. Kiviranta's emotional state suggests that she is coping well with the recent traumatic events but may require ongoing support to manage any potential long-term effects of the abuse.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
Given the moderate case severity, it is recommended that Ms. Kiviranta continues to receive support from local social services and domestic abuse resources. This includes counseling for both herself and her child, as well as ongoing monitoring of the household's living conditions and emotional well-being.

In addition, due to the potential risks associated with the abusive partner, it is recommended that Ms. Kiviranta be referred to a local women's shelter for additional safety measures and support. A follow-up visit will be scheduled within two weeks to assess the implementation of these recommendations and ensure the continued well-being of both Ms. Kiviranta and her child.

It is essential that Ms. Kiviranta feels supported during this difficult time, and every effort should be made to provide her with the resources and assistance needed to rebuild her life free from domestic abuse.
