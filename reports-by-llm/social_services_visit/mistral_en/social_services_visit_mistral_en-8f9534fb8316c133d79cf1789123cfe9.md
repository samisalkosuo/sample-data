 Title: Household Financial Hardship Review - Ristijärvi, Finland (25.07.2025)

Client Information:
Name: Sauli Mäki (45 years old)
Address: Kauppakatu 12 A, 96300 Ristijärvi, Finland

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The visit was conducted to review the financial hardship situation of Mr. Sauli Mäki and his family, given their history of chronic domestic violence. The purpose was to assess the current living conditions, identify potential risks, and provide appropriate support services.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, the living conditions were found to be modest but clean. Mr. Mäki appeared anxious during our initial interaction but cooperative throughout the visit. His wife, who was present, seemed withdrawn and avoided direct eye contact. The children (ages 8, 10, and 12) were observed playing quietly in another room.

During the discussion, Mr. Mäki expressed concerns about his employment status and income, which has been affected by a recent layoff. He also shared that he had sought counseling for his domestic violence issues but was struggling to maintain control due to financial stress.

Assessment:
The case severity is currently low, as there have been no reported incidents of domestic violence since the last visit. However, the family's financial hardship and Mr. Mäki's ongoing struggle with anger management pose significant risks. The emotional state of both parents suggests a need for continued support and counseling.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Refer Mr. Mäki to local job placement services to assist in finding employment.
2. Continue domestic violence counseling for Mr. Mäki, with a focus on stress management techniques and coping strategies.
3. Provide financial assistance for essential needs on a temporary basis, while encouraging the exploration of long-term solutions such as budgeting workshops or debt counseling services.
4. Schedule follow-up visits to monitor progress, assess the family's continued need for support, and ensure the safety of all household members.
5. Offer parenting classes and family therapy sessions to improve communication and conflict resolution within the family.
