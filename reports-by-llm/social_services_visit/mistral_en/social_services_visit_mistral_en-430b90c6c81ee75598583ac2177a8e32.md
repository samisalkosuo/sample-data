 Visit Report: Follow-up on School Truancy Case

Visit Date: 01.04.2025
Location: Harjavalta, Finland
Visit Type: Follow-up on school truancy report
Household Composition: Single father (Juhani Kivim채ki) with one child (Elli Kivim채ki, age 13)
Case Severity: Critical

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to follow up on a school truancy report concerning Elli Kivim채ki, who has been frequently absent from school without valid reasons. The visit aimed to assess the situation at home and determine the root causes of the truancy, as well as to discuss potential solutions and support services for both Juhani and Elli.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, it was evident that the living conditions in the Kivim채ki household were modest but clean. Juhani appeared anxious and somewhat disorganized during our conversation. He expressed concern about Elli's school performance and admitted to struggling with managing both his work and parental responsibilities. Elli, on the other hand, seemed withdrawn and reluctant to engage in the discussion.

Assessment:
The critical case severity is primarily due to Elli's persistent truancy, which has led to a significant decline in her academic performance. The root cause appears to be a combination of family stressors, including Juhani's struggle with managing his work and parental responsibilities, as well as Elli's emotional distress that may stem from these circumstances.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Referral to a local counseling service for both Juhani and Elli to address any underlying emotional issues and provide support in managing stressors.
2. Collaboration with the school to develop an individualized education plan for Elli, focusing on catching up on missed work and providing additional academic support as needed.
3. Exploration of potential employment assistance programs for Juhani to help him better balance his work and family responsibilities.
4. Regular follow-up visits to monitor progress and adjust the support plan as necessary.

It is crucial that immediate action is taken to address this critical situation, as Elli's truancy poses a significant risk to her future academic success and overall wellbeing. By providing Juhani and Elli with the appropriate resources and support, we can help them navigate through these challenging times and work towards a more stable and secure future for both of them.
