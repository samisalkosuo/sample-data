 Visit Report: Sulkava Elderly Care Follow-up - 23.03.2025

Client: Kaarina and Matti Sorsa
Address: Mäkelänkatu 12, 48600 Sulkava, Finland

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct a follow-up on the reported neglect case within the household of Kaarina and Matti Sorsa. As a high severity case, it is crucial to ensure the wellbeing of the elderly individuals involved and address any ongoing concerns.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, the living conditions were found to be substandard for an elderly couple. The house appeared cluttered, with limited accessibility features for the elderly. Kaarina and Matti both displayed signs of emotional distress, with Matti appearing particularly agitated and unresponsive during our conversation. Their physical health also seemed to have deteriorated since our last visit.

During the discussion, it became apparent that Kaarina was struggling to cope with the increasing care demands of her husband, Matti. She expressed feelings of frustration and exhaustion, which may have contributed to the reported neglect. It is essential to address these emotional factors to ensure the wellbeing of both individuals.

Assessment:
The current living conditions and emotional state of Kaarina and Matti Sorsa indicate a high risk for further neglect and potential decline in their physical health. The substandard living conditions are not conducive to their needs, and the emotional strain on Kaarina is evident. It is crucial to provide support services to alleviate the care burden on Kaarina and improve the overall living situation for both individuals.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Home Adaptation: Arrange for home adaptations, such as installing grab bars, non-slip flooring, and widening doorways to improve accessibility for the elderly couple.
2. Respite Care: Refer Kaarina to a local respite care service to provide her with temporary relief from caregiving duties. This will help reduce her emotional stress and ensure that Matti receives proper care.
3. Counseling Services: Offer counseling services for both Kaarina and Matti to address their emotional needs and improve their coping mechanisms.
4. Regular Follow-ups: Schedule regular follow-up visits to monitor the progress of the home adaptations, assess the effectiveness of the respite care, and ensure that both individuals are receiving adequate care and support.
5. Social Services Referrals: Connect Kaarina with local social services that can provide additional assistance, such as meal delivery, transportation, or financial aid.

By implementing these recommendations, we aim to improve the living conditions and emotional wellbeing of Kaarina and Matti Sorsa, reducing the risk of further neglect and ensuring their continued care in a safe and supportive environment.
