 Visit Report: Unaccompanied Minor Intake Assessment - 01.01.2025

Location: Nousiainen, Finland

Client Information:
Name: Elias Kivim채ki
Address: Mets채nkartano 3, Nousiainen, FI-38600

Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct an intake assessment for the unaccompanied minor, Elias Kivim채ki, in response to a reported case of neglect within his household. The assessment aimed to evaluate the living conditions, family dynamics, and potential risks to the minor's wellbeing, given the low case severity.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival at the residence, it was noted that the living conditions were generally clean and orderly. However, there were signs of neglect in Elias's personal space, such as unattended hygiene needs and a lack of age-appropriate activities or educational materials. The parents appeared to be preoccupied and showed minimal interaction with their son during the visit. Elias himself seemed withdrawn and hesitant, displaying signs of emotional distress.

Assessment:
The assessment indicates that while the living conditions are not severely detrimental to Elias's wellbeing, there is a need for increased support and supervision within the household to address the reported neglect case. The parents' preoccupation may be due to personal or financial stressors, which could potentially impact their ability to provide adequate care for their son. Elias's emotional state suggests that he may benefit from counseling services to help him cope with any feelings of isolation or anxiety.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
In light of the assessment findings, it is recommended that social services initiate regular home visits to monitor the situation and provide guidance on appropriate care for Elias. The parents should be offered resources for stress management and financial assistance if applicable. Additionally, Elias should be referred to a counselor specializing in children's mental health to address his emotional distress. A follow-up visit is scheduled within two weeks to assess the family's progress and adjust support services as needed.

It is crucial that we continue to work collaboratively with the Kivim채ki family to ensure Elias's wellbeing and promote a safe, nurturing environment for his growth and development.
