 Visit Report

Visit Date: 20.10.2024
Location: Parkano, Finland
Visit Type: Veteran Support Service Check-in

Client Information:
Name: Eero Mäki
Address: Kauppakatu 3, Apt. 5, Parkano, Finland

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct a routine check-in for Eero Mäki, a young adult veteran living alone, as part of our ongoing support services. Given the case's moderate severity, it is crucial to monitor his wellbeing and ensure he has access to necessary resources.

Observations During the Visit:
During the visit, Eero appeared calm and open to discussion. His living conditions were clean and well-maintained, with evidence of a structured daily routine. However, there were signs of emotional distress, such as occasional outbursts and difficulty maintaining eye contact. Notable concerns included his isolation from social networks and a lack of engagement in recreational activities.

Assessment:
Eero's case presents moderate severity due to the emotional strain he is experiencing. His living conditions are stable, but his emotional state suggests a need for additional support. The absence of a strong social network and limited participation in leisure activities may exacerbate feelings of isolation and loneliness.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
To address these concerns, we recommend the following actions:
1. Referral to a local counseling service specializing in veteran mental health issues to help Eero manage his emotional state.
2. Encourage participation in social clubs or recreational activities within the community to foster connections and combat isolation.
3. Schedule regular follow-up visits to monitor progress, adjust support services as needed, and provide ongoing emotional support.
4. Explore opportunities for vocational training or employment to promote self-sufficiency and a sense of purpose.

By addressing these issues, we aim to improve Eero's overall wellbeing and help him transition more smoothly into civilian life following his military service.
