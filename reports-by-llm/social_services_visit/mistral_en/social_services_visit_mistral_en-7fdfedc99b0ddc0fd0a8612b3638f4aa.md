Client Information:
Name: Sari Kivim채ki (Kuopio, Finland)
Address: M채kel채nkatu 56 A, 70100 Kuopio, Finland
Case Number: FIN-SS-24-003
Case Severity: Low

Visit Summary:
The visit was conducted on the 7th of September 2024 as part of a child visitation supervision program. The purpose of this visit was to assess the living conditions and wellbeing of Sari Kivim채ki's child, in light of her role as a single caregiver supporting an elderly parent with dementia.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, the living environment appeared clean and well-maintained. The child, aged 8, was observed to be playful, engaged, and seemingly content. Sari demonstrated patience and affection towards her child throughout the visit. Her elderly parent, who was diagnosed with dementia, was calm and responsive during brief interactions but required assistance with daily tasks.

Assessment:
The current situation presents a low level of risk, as Sari appears to be managing both her caregiving responsibilities effectively and maintaining a positive relationship with her child. However, the presence of an elderly parent with dementia may potentially impact Sari's ability to provide consistent care in the long term.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
Given the low case severity, no immediate concerns were identified during this visit. It is recommended that regular follow-ups continue to monitor the family's wellbeing and assess any potential changes in their circumstances. Additionally, it would be beneficial for Sari to explore respite care options to ensure she can maintain her role as a dedicated parent while managing her caregiving responsibilities effectively.

In conclusion, the visit confirmed that Sari is providing a nurturing environment for her child and coping well with her dual caregiving roles. Regular follow-ups will continue to assess the family's needs and ensure appropriate support services are in place as necessary.
