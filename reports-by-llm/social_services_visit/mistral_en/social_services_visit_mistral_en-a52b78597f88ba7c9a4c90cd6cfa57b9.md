 Visit Report: Emergency Housing Verification - Pyhäjärvi, Finland (30.07.2025)

Client Information:
Name: Sini Kivijärvi
Address: Metsänkuja 12, Pyhäjärvi, Finland

Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct an emergency housing verification due to the urgent need for suitable accommodation for a teenage mother and her infant, who are currently residing with their parents. The case has been classified as moderate in severity, indicating a need for immediate intervention to ensure the well-being of all parties involved.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival at Metsänkuja 12, it was evident that the living conditions were cramped and not conducive to the needs of a growing family. The household consists of Sini Kivijärvi (mother), her infant, and both parents. Interactions during the visit revealed strained relationships within the family, with tension particularly apparent between Sini and her mother.

The emotional state of all parties appeared stressed, with Sini expressing feelings of isolation and frustration due to her inability to provide a stable home for her child. The infant was observed to be well-cared for but seemed distressed by the high levels of stress within the household. Notable concerns include the lack of privacy for Sini and her baby, as well as the potential impact of the tense family dynamics on their emotional well-being.

Assessment:
The current living situation poses a risk to the emotional and physical health of both Sini and her infant. The cramped quarters and strained family relationships create an environment that is not conducive to positive development for either party. The case severity is moderate, as there are no immediate threats to safety but the situation requires intervention to prevent further deterioration.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
Immediate action is required to secure emergency housing for Sini and her infant. Referrals will be made to local social services for financial assistance and counseling support to help alleviate the stress within the family. A follow-up visit will be scheduled within two weeks to assess the progress of the situation and ensure that appropriate resources have been allocated.

It is crucial that Sini and her infant are provided with a safe, stable living environment as soon as possible to promote their emotional well-being and overall development. Ongoing support from social services will be essential in addressing the underlying issues within the family and helping them navigate this challenging time.
