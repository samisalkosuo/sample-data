Date: 07.01.2025

Client Information:
Name: Kaarina Kivijärvi (Grandmother)
Address: Metsänkartano 3, Pyhäjärvi, Finland

Visit Purpose:
The visit was conducted post-hospital discharge of the grandchildren, who were admitted due to health concerns. The purpose of this visit was to assess the living conditions and support systems in place for the children's recovery at home with their grandparents.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, Kaarina Kivijärvi warmly welcomed the social worker into her home. The living conditions were clean and well-maintained, with a noticeable emphasis on creating a comfortable environment for the children. The grandchildren, aged 8 and 10, appeared to be in good spirits but showed signs of fatigue due to their recent hospital stay. Kaarina expressed concern about managing their medication regimen and ensuring proper nutrition for their recovery.

Assessment:
The case severity is moderate, as the children's health remains a priority concern. The grandparents are committed to providing care for their grandchildren but may require additional support in managing their medical needs and ensuring a balanced diet. Family dynamics appear strong, with Kaarina demonstrating a deep love and concern for her grandchildren.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Referral to a home healthcare nurse to assist with medication management and provide education on post-hospital care guidelines.
2. Connection with a local nutritionist to ensure the children receive balanced meals during their recovery.
3. Scheduled follow-up visits to monitor the children's progress and address any emerging concerns.
4. Provision of resources for stress management and coping strategies for Kaarina, as caregiving can be emotionally taxing.

In conclusion, while the grandparents are dedicated to caring for their grandchildren, additional support is necessary to ensure a smooth recovery post-hospital discharge. The recommended actions aim to address the identified needs and provide the necessary resources for the family during this challenging time.
