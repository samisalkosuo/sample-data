Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to assess the financial situation of the household in question, consisting of a teenage mother and her infant, residing with their parents. The review aimed to identify any hardships they may be experiencing and to provide potential solutions or resources to alleviate their financial stress.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, the living conditions were found to be modest but clean. The family appeared welcoming and cooperative throughout the visit. The teenage mother, Ms. Liisa Niemi (aged 19), was visibly stressed and anxious about her current financial situation. Her parents, Mr. and Mrs. Juhani Niemi, expressed concern for their daughter's wellbeing and that of their grandchild.

The family disclosed that they have been struggling to make ends meet due to unexpected medical expenses related to the infant's health issues. They have exhausted their savings and are finding it difficult to cover basic necessities such as food, utilities, and rent.
