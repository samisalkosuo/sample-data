 Visit Report

Visit Date: 31.10.2024
Location: Kökar, Finland
Visit Type: Immigration Case Monitoring Visit

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct a routine monitoring check on the progress and well-being of Ms. Sari Kiviranta, a client who is currently undergoing recovery from domestic abuse and in the process of securing permanent residency in Finland. The visit aimed to assess her living conditions, emotional state, and overall progress since our last encounter.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival at Ms. Kiviranta's residence, I was greeted warmly by Sari, who appeared calm and composed. Her apartment was clean and well-maintained, with no signs of distress or disarray. Sari shared that she has been attending counseling sessions regularly and has been actively participating in support groups for survivors of domestic abuse. She expressed gratitude for the assistance provided thus far and spoke positively about her newfound independence.

Assessment:
Given the low case severity, it is evident that Ms. Kiviranta is making significant strides towards recovery. Her living conditions are stable, and she appears to be emotionally resilient. However, it is essential to continue monitoring her progress and offer additional support as needed to ensure a smooth transition into her new life.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
In light of the positive developments, I recommend that we maintain our current level of support for Ms. Kiviranta. She should continue attending counseling sessions and participating in support groups. Additionally, I suggest scheduling a follow-up visit in three months to assess her progress further and address any potential concerns that may arise.

In the interim, I will liaise with her counselor to ensure that she remains engaged in therapy and is making steady progress. If necessary, I will also explore opportunities for additional support services or resources that could benefit Ms. Kiviranta during this critical period of her recovery.
