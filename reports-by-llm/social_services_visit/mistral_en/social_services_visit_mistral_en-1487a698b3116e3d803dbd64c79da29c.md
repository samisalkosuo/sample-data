 **Social Services Visit Report**

Visit Date: 31.10.2024
Location: Oulu, Finland
Visit Type: Veteran Support Service Check-in

**Summary of Visit Purpose**

The purpose of this visit was to conduct a routine check-in for the unaccompanied minor (Matti Järvinen) currently residing in temporary housing as part of our veteran support services. The primary objective was to assess Matti's wellbeing, living conditions, and any potential needs or concerns that may have arisen since our last visit.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival, Matti greeted me warmly and appeared to be in good spirits. His temporary housing unit was clean and well-maintained, with evidence of personal belongings arranged neatly throughout. During our conversation, Matti expressed a sense of comfort and security within his current living situation. He shared that he has been adjusting well to school and has made new friends.

However, during the discussion, Matti mentioned feeling occasional loneliness due to being away from his extended family. He also expressed concern about the future, as he is unsure of when or if he will be reunited with them. Emotionally, Matti appears resilient but could benefit from additional emotional support and guidance regarding these concerns.

**Assessment**

Given the low case severity, it is encouraging to see that Matti is adapting well to his temporary living situation and school environment. However, it is essential to address his feelings of loneliness and uncertainty about his future. The potential impact on his emotional wellbeing warrants further exploration and support.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. Refer Matti to a counselor specializing in issues related to family separation and adolescent development for ongoing emotional support.
2. Schedule regular follow-up visits to monitor Matti's wellbeing, address any new concerns that may arise, and provide additional resources as needed.
3. Explore opportunities for Matti to maintain contact with his extended family, such as video calls or letter exchanges, to help alleviate feelings of loneliness.
4. Continue providing Matti with access to educational resources and extracurricular activities to support his personal growth and development.
