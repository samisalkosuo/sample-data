Location: Veteli, Finland
Visit Type: Homeless outreach visit

Client Information:
Name: Anna Lehto (fictional)
Address: Kauppakatu 12 A, Veteli, Finland

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct an outreach assessment for a family with a history of chronic domestic violence, currently homeless and residing in temporary shelters. The visit aimed to evaluate the living conditions, emotional state, and family dynamics, as well as identify potential risks and recommend appropriate support services.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival at the designated shelter, Anna Lehto and her three children (ages 7, 9, and 12) were found to be in a distressed emotional state. The living conditions within the temporary accommodation were cramped and unhygienic, with limited access to basic amenities such as cooking facilities and personal hygiene items. Anna displayed signs of anxiety and exhaustion, while her children appeared withdrawn and subdued.

Assessment:
The case severity is high due to the chronic history of domestic violence, current homelessness, and the poor living conditions that are likely impacting the emotional well-being and development of the children. The family dynamics appear strained, with Anna struggling to cope with the stressors of their situation while also managing the needs of her children.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
Immediate action is required to ensure the safety and well-being of this family. Recommendations include:

1. Emergency housing placement in a safe, secure, and suitable accommodation with access to essential amenities.
2. Referral to a domestic violence support service for ongoing counseling and assistance in managing the chronic domestic violence issue.
3. Access to financial aid and employment support services to help Anna regain stability and independence.
4. Ongoing monitoring of the family's progress, with regular follow-up visits to assess their needs and adjust support services as necessary.
5. Engaging the children in age-appropriate counseling to address any emotional trauma or distress caused by their current situation.

In conclusion, this visit has highlighted the urgent need for intervention and support for Anna Lehto and her family. By addressing their immediate housing needs, providing access to essential services, and offering ongoing counseling and support, we can help them break the cycle of chronic domestic violence and homelessness, ultimately improving their quality of life and promoting long-term stability.
