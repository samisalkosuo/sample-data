 Title: Child Visitation Supervision Report - 08.08.2024

Client Information:
Name: Sari Myrskylä (Grandmother)
Address: Miettisillankatu 12, Myrskylä, Finland

Visit Summary:
The visit was conducted on August 8th, 2024, as part of the child visitation supervision program due to the moderate case severity involving Sari Myrskylä caring for her grandchildren. The purpose of this visit was to assess the living conditions and overall well-being of the children, as well as to evaluate the family dynamics within the household.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, the house appeared clean and well-maintained. Sari warmly welcomed the social worker and showed a genuine concern for her grandchildren's welfare. The children, aged 7 and 9, were observed to be playful and engaged in age-appropriate activities. They seemed happy and well-adjusted, displaying no signs of distress or emotional instability.

During the visit, Sari demonstrated patience and understanding towards her grandchildren, addressing their needs promptly and effectively. However, it was noted that she appeared somewhat overwhelmed at times, particularly when managing household chores and caring for the children simultaneously.

Assessment:
The living conditions were satisfactory, and the children's emotional state was positive. Sari showed a strong commitment to her role as a caregiver, but the moderate case severity indicates that she may require additional support to manage stress effectively and maintain a balanced home environment.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
Given the current situation, it is recommended that Sari be referred to local support services for caregiver resources and stress management techniques. Regular follow-up visits will continue to monitor the children's well-being and assess any changes in family dynamics. Additionally, a meeting with the children's school counselor may provide valuable insights into their academic progress and social interactions outside of the home.

In conclusion, while the living conditions and emotional state of the children are currently stable, ongoing support is necessary to ensure Sari can continue providing a nurturing environment for her grandchildren. The recommended actions aim to strengthen Sari's ability to manage stress and maintain a balanced household, ultimately benefiting the overall well-being of the family.
