 Visit Report: Unaccompanied Minor Intake Assessment

Visit Date: 31.05.2025
Location: Kirkkonummi, Finland
Visit Type: Unaccompanied Minor Intake Assessment

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct an intake assessment for an unaccompanied minor residing in Kirkkonummi. The assessment aimed to evaluate the living conditions, family dynamics, and emotional state of the minor, as well as identify any potential risks or concerns that may require immediate attention or further support services.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival at the residence, I was greeted by a single mother (Ms. Sari Mäki) and her three children aged 7, 9, and 12 years old. The living conditions were modest but clean, with adequate space for the family. Ms. Mäki appeared to be a caring and attentive mother, however, she expressed signs of stress and fatigue during our conversation.

The unaccompanied minor, whom we will refer to as Elias Mäki, was initially shy but warmed up over time. He seemed well-adjusted considering the circumstances, demonstrating good manners and a willingness to engage in conversation. However, it was evident that he had been experiencing emotional distress, as he occasionally displayed signs of anxiety and withdrew at times during our interaction.

Assessment:
Based on the case severity rating of moderate, it is clear that the family is facing challenges related to the unaccompanied status of Elias Mäki. The mother's apparent stress and fatigue may be indicative of the additional burden placed upon her in caring for a minor without familial support. Furthermore, Elias' emotional distress suggests that he may require additional counseling or therapeutic services to help him cope with his situation.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Referral to a child psychologist for Elias Mäki to address his emotional distress and provide coping mechanisms.
2. Explore options for resettlement support services, such as financial assistance or housing modifications, to alleviate some of the burden on Ms. Sari Mäki.
3. Schedule follow-up visits to monitor the progress of Elias Mäki's emotional wellbeing and assess the effectiveness of any recommended interventions.
4. Provide resources for stress management and self-care for Ms. Sari Mäki, such as counseling or support groups, to help her manage the additional responsibilities associated with caring for an unaccompanied minor.
