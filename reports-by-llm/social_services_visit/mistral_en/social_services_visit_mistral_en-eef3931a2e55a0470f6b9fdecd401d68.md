 Visit Report: Disability Support Assessment - 02.05.2025

Location: Hämeenlinna, Finland
Visit Type: Disability Support Assessment
Household Composition: Family of five residing in a subsidized apartment at Kauppakatu 12, Apt. 3B, Hämeenlinna, Finland
Case Severity: Critical

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct an assessment of the family's needs and provide recommendations for disability support services in response to the critical case severity. The focus was on understanding the family dynamics, living conditions, and identifying any notable concerns that may impact the well-being of the family members, particularly the individual with disabilities.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, it was evident that the living conditions were cramped, with limited space for mobility within the apartment. The family consisted of parents, Mr. and Mrs. Sointu, their three children, and their 12-year-old son, Joonas, who has been diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Joonas was observed to be agitated and struggling to cope with his environment, exhibiting repetitive behaviors and difficulty communicating effectively.

The parents expressed concern about their inability to provide adequate care for Joonas due to the stressful living conditions and limited resources. They also shared that they were overwhelmed by the demands of caring for a child with special needs while managing the daily responsibilities of maintaining a household and providing for their other children.

Assessment:
The critical case severity is primarily attributed to the family's inability to meet Joonas's complex needs, which are exacerbated by the cramped living conditions and financial constraints. The parents' emotional state was visibly strained, indicating a high level of stress and burnout. There is an urgent need for additional support services to alleviate the family's burden and ensure Joonas receives appropriate care and accommodations.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Referral to a specialized autism support service for comprehensive assessment, therapy, and resource allocation.
2. Application for financial assistance to address immediate needs, such as home modifications and purchasing necessary equipment for Joonas's care.
3. Collaboration with local schools to ensure appropriate accommodations and support for Joonas during his educational journey.
4. Follow-up visit within two weeks to assess the family's progress and adjust recommendations as needed.
5. Exploration of respite care options to provide temporary relief for the parents, allowing them time to rest and recharge.
6. Connection with community resources, such as support groups and parenting workshops, to help the family cope with the challenges they face.

It is essential that immediate action be taken to address the critical case severity and ensure the well-being of Joonas and his family. By providing additional support services and resources, we can help alleviate their burden and improve their quality of life.
