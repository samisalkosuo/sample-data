Visit Type: Safety Plan Monitoring Visit

Client Information:
Name: Sari Kivimäki
Address: Mannerheimintie 4A, Maalahti, 02300 Helsinki
Case Context: Parent with substance use disorder and children
Case Severity: Moderate

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to monitor the implementation of the safety plan established for Sari Kivimäki and her family, given the moderate case severity due to the parent's substance use disorder. The visit aimed to assess the living conditions, emotional state, and overall well-being of both the parent and children, as well as identify any potential risks or concerns that may require further intervention.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, the apartment appeared clean and well-maintained, with no signs of substance use paraphernalia visible. Sari greeted me warmly and seemed to be in a relatively stable emotional state. The children were present but appeared shy and somewhat withdrawn. During our conversation, Sari expressed her commitment to maintaining sobriety and prioritizing the well-being of her children.

However, there were some concerns that emerged during the visit. Sari mentioned experiencing occasional relapses, which she attributed to stress and lack of support from her social network. Additionally, the children seemed to be struggling with their mother's substance use history, exhibiting signs of anxiety and emotional distress.

Assessment:
While Sari has made significant strides in managing her substance use disorder, the occasional relapses and the impact on her children indicate that the case remains moderately severe. The family dynamics are complex, with Sari struggling to balance her recovery and parental responsibilities while also dealing with limited social support.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
Given these findings, it is recommended that Sari continues participating in a local substance abuse treatment program to further strengthen her recovery. Additionally, referrals should be made for the children to receive counseling to help them cope with their mother's history of substance use.

To address the lack of social support, efforts should be made to connect Sari with local support groups and community resources that can provide emotional and practical assistance. Regular follow-up visits will be scheduled to monitor progress and adjust the safety plan as necessary.

In conclusion, while there have been positive developments in Sari's recovery, ongoing support and monitoring are essential to ensure the well-being of both Sari and her children. The recommended actions aim to provide the necessary resources and assistance to help the family navigate this challenging situation.
