 **Social Services Visit Report**

**Visit Date:** 18.10.2024

**Location:** Kitee, Finland

**Visit Type:** Family Reunification Progress Check

**Household Composition:** The Sipilä family, consisting of parents Juhani (35) and Liisa Sipilä (32), along with their three children: Elina (8), Eero (6), and Emilia (4). The family resides in a subsidized apartment located at Kauppakatu 12, Kitee.

**Case Severity:** Low

**Summary of Visit Purpose:** This visit was conducted to assess the progress of the Sipilä family's reunification process following their relocation to Kitee. The primary objective was to evaluate the living conditions and emotional well-being of the family members, as well as to discuss any challenges they may have encountered during their transition.

**Observations During the Visit:** Upon arrival, the Sipilä family welcomed me warmly. The apartment appeared clean and well-maintained, with a homely atmosphere. The children were playful yet attentive, while Juhani and Liisa displayed a calm and cooperative demeanor throughout the visit.

During our conversation, it was evident that the family had adapted well to their new environment. They expressed satisfaction with their subsidized apartment and appreciated the support they received from local social services during their relocation. However, Juhani mentioned some challenges in finding employment due to the current economic climate. Liisa, on the other hand, reported feeling isolated as she has yet to establish a network of friends in Kitee.

**Assessment:** Given the low case severity, the Sipilä family is generally managing well. The living conditions are satisfactory, and the children appear to be thriving. However, it is essential to address Juhani's employment concerns and Liisa's feelings of isolation to ensure a smooth transition for the family.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up:** I recommend that we continue providing support to the Sipilä family, focusing on addressing their specific needs. For Juhani, it would be beneficial to connect him with local job placement services and vocational training programs if necessary. To help Liisa integrate into the community, I suggest organizing social events or connecting her with local parenting groups where she can meet other families in a similar situation.

I will schedule a follow-up visit within three months to assess the family's progress and adjust our support services accordingly. If needed, we can also explore additional resources such as counseling services for emotional support.
