 Title: Social Services Visit Report - 22.02.2025

Location: Raahe, Finland
Visit Type: Homeless Outreach Visit

Client Information:
Name: Anni Mäki (Grandmother)
Address: Kauppakatu 12, Apt. 3, Raahe, 83100

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct an outreach assessment for the homeless grandparents, Anni Mäki and her husband, who are currently caring for their grandchildren. The visit aimed to evaluate their living conditions, emotional state, and identify any potential risks or needs that may require immediate attention or further support services.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival at the designated location, it was evident that the family was residing in a temporary shelter. Anni Mäki warmly welcomed the social worker and expressed gratitude for the visit. The grandparents appeared to be in good health but visibly tired due to the challenging circumstances. The children, aged 8 and 10, were well-behaved and seemed to have adapted relatively well considering their current situation.

The living conditions within the shelter were basic, with limited privacy and amenities. However, the family managed to maintain a clean and organized space for themselves. Anni Mäki shared her concerns about finding stable, long-term housing that could accommodate both the grandparents and their grandchildren.

Assessment:
The case severity is currently low due to the family's resilience and adaptability in difficult circumstances. However, the lack of permanent housing remains a significant concern that requires immediate attention to ensure the wellbeing and stability of the children. The emotional state of both Anni Mäki and her husband appears to be stable at present but may deteriorate if the housing situation is not addressed promptly.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Immediate referral for permanent housing assistance through local housing authorities.
2. Collaboration with local schools to ensure the children's educational needs are being met and any additional support services are provided as necessary.
3. Regular follow-up visits to monitor the family's progress, address any emerging concerns, and provide ongoing emotional support.
4. Exploration of potential financial assistance programs to alleviate any short-term financial burdens.
5. Connection with community resources for access to food, clothing, and other essential items as needed.

In conclusion, the visit revealed a resilient family in need of permanent housing and ongoing support services. The recommended actions aim to address these needs and ensure the wellbeing and stability of Anni Mäki, her husband, and their grandchildren.
