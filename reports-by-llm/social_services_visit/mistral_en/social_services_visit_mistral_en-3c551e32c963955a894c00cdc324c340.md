 Title: Social Services Visit Report - 08.07.2025

Client Information:
Name: Sirkka Kiviranta
Address: Mäntylahdenkatu 12, Evijärvi, Finland

Visit Purpose:
The visit was conducted as an at-risk youth intervention, due to concerns about the wellbeing of a minor residing in the household, given the elderly woman's (Sirkka Kiviranta) early dementia symptoms and the resulting potential impact on her ability to provide adequate care.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, Sirkka Kiviranta appeared disoriented but generally cooperative. The living conditions were clean and well-maintained, with evidence of regular assistance from community services. However, there was a noticeable absence of a child's presence or belongings, suggesting that the at-risk youth may no longer be residing in the household.

During our conversation, Sirkka expressed confusion about the purpose of the visit and seemed unable to recall specific details about the minor's whereabouts or recent activities. This raised concerns about her ability to ensure the safety and wellbeing of the child. Emotionally, she appeared anxious and distressed, which may be a result of her worsening dementia symptoms.

Assessment:
Given the moderate case severity and Sirkka's early-stage dementia diagnosis, it is crucial to address the immediate concern about the whereabouts of the at-risk youth. The elderly woman's cognitive decline may compromise her ability to provide adequate care, increasing the risk for the child.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Immediate search for the missing minor, involving local law enforcement and social services if necessary.
2. Refer Sirkka Kiviranta for a comprehensive dementia assessment and connect her with appropriate support services to manage her condition and improve her overall wellbeing.
3. Arrange regular follow-up visits to monitor Sirkka's condition, ensure the safety of any minors in her care, and provide ongoing support as needed.
4. Collaborate with local schools and community organizations to identify any potential contacts or leads regarding the missing child.
5. Explore options for temporary guardianship or alternative living arrangements if the child is found and it is determined that Sirkka cannot provide adequate care.

It is essential to act swiftly in this situation to ensure the safety and wellbeing of the at-risk youth and provide necessary support to Sirkka Kiviranta as her condition continues to progress.
