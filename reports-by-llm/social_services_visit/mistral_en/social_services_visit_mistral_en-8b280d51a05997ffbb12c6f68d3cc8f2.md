Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to assess the safety and well-being of Emilia Kiviranta, an unaccompanied minor residing in temporary housing within Kangasniemi. The visit aimed to ensure that the living conditions meet the necessary standards for a newborn and infant, as well as to provide support and guidance to the minor during this critical period.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, Emilia was observed to be in good spirits, engaging and cooperative throughout the visit. The temporary housing unit appeared clean and well-maintained, with essential amenities such as a crib, changing table, and baby supplies readily available. Emilia demonstrated an understanding of basic infant care practices, such as proper diapering and feeding techniques.

However, during the conversation, it was noted that Emilia expressed feelings of loneliness and anxiety due to being away from her family. She also mentioned concerns about navigating the Finnish educational system and adapting to a new culture.

Assessment:
The low case severity is reflected in the overall positive living conditions and Emilia's basic caregiving abilities. However, it is essential to address Emilia's emotional well-being, as her feelings of loneliness and anxiety may impact her long-term adjustment and success in her new environment.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Refer Emilia to a local counseling service specializing in supporting unaccompanied minors to help address her emotional concerns and provide coping strategies.
2. Connect Emilia with a mentor from the local community who can offer guidance, support, and friendship during this critical period.
3. Schedule follow-up visits to monitor Emilia's progress, adjust any necessary services, and ensure that she continues to thrive in her new environment.
4. Collaborate with the educational system to facilitate a smooth transition for Emilia, ensuring that her unique needs are met and accommodated as needed.

By addressing these recommendations, we aim to support Emilia's successful integration into her new home while ensuring her emotional well-being and long-term success.
