 Title: Routine Family Wellbeing Visit Report - Kemiönsaari, Finland (24.06.2025)

Client: Elias Sorsa
Address: Mäntylahdenkatu 12, 20630 Kemiönsaari, Finland

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this routine family wellbeing visit was to assess the living conditions and emotional state of Elias Sorsa, a teenager in foster care, due to the case severity being classified as urgent. The visit aimed to evaluate his current situation, identify any risks or concerns, and provide recommendations for appropriate support services.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival at the residence, it was noted that the living conditions were clean and well-maintained. Elias appeared calm and cooperative during our conversation. He shared that he has been adjusting to his new foster family but still struggles with feelings of loneliness and missing his biological family. It was evident that he values the support provided by his foster parents, yet he expressed a desire for more frequent contact with his biological family.

Assessment:
The case severity classification of urgent is justified given Elias's emotional state and the need for ongoing support during this critical period of transition. The teenager's feelings of loneliness and longing for his biological family may indicate a risk of emotional distress if not addressed promptly. It is essential to ensure that Elias receives adequate emotional support, as well as opportunities for regular contact with his biological family, while maintaining a stable living environment in his foster home.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Arrange for regular counseling sessions for Elias to help him cope with feelings of loneliness and adjust to his new living situation.
2. Facilitate more frequent contact between Elias and his biological family, such as video calls or supervised visits, to alleviate his feelings of isolation.
3. Encourage the foster parents to continue providing a supportive and nurturing environment for Elias, while being mindful of his emotional needs during this transitional period.
4. Schedule follow-up visits to monitor Elias's progress and adjust support services as necessary.
5. Collaborate with social workers, school counselors, and other relevant professionals to ensure a coordinated approach in supporting Elias's wellbeing.
