Location: Sievi, Finland
Visit Type: At-risk youth intervention visit

Client Information:
Name: Juhani Kivim채ki
Address: M채kel채nkatu 12, Apt. 4, Sievi, 93600

Case Context: Urgent intervention required due to escalating behavioral issues and potential harm to the well-being of the minor child involved.

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to assess the living conditions and emotional state of Juhani Kivim채ki, a single father with one child, in order to determine the appropriate support services needed to address the urgent case severity.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, it was evident that the living conditions were somewhat disorganized, with signs of neglect and a general lack of structure. Juhani appeared visibly stressed and anxious during our conversation. The child, aged 10, seemed withdrawn and displayed signs of emotional distress. There were concerns raised about the child's safety due to escalating behavioral issues, including aggressive outbursts and difficulty maintaining focus at school.

Assessment:
The current living conditions and Juhani's emotional state indicate a high level of stress and potential inability to provide adequate care for his child. The child's behavioral issues suggest that there may be underlying emotional or developmental challenges that require professional intervention. The case severity is urgent due to the potential harm to the child's well-being.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Immediate referral for Juhani and the child to a family counselor specializing in at-risk youth and parenting support.
2. Collaboration with school officials to address the child's academic struggles and behavioral issues, potentially involving additional resources such as a school psychologist or social worker.
3. Home environment assessment and cleanup services to ensure a safe and structured living space for both Juhani and his child.
4. Regular follow-up visits to monitor progress and adjust support services as necessary.
5. Exploration of potential financial assistance programs to alleviate some of the economic pressures on Juhani.

It is crucial that these recommended actions are implemented promptly to ensure the well-being and safety of both Juhani and his child, and to address the urgent case severity.
