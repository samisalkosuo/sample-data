 Visit Report: Substance Abuse Support Visit

Visit Date: 09.05.2025
Location: Tyrn채v채, Finland
Visit Type: Substance Abuse Support Visit

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to provide substance abuse support and assess the living conditions for an elderly man (Juha Kivinen, 68 years old) residing with his adult daughter (Anna Kivinen, 42 years old) in Tyrn채v채. The case has been classified as critical due to the significant impact of substance abuse on their wellbeing and overall household dynamics.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, it was evident that the living conditions were substandard, with signs of neglect and hoarding throughout the house. Juha appeared disheveled, unkempt, and exhibited slurred speech, which suggested ongoing substance abuse. Anna seemed visibly stressed and overwhelmed by the situation, expressing concern for her father's health and wellbeing.

During the conversation, both individuals were evasive when discussing their substance use, demonstrating a lack of insight into the severity of the problem. Juha denied any issues with alcohol, while Anna admitted to using prescription drugs without a valid prescription. Both parties expressed reluctance towards seeking help or engaging in treatment programs.

Assessment:
The critical case severity is justified given the observed living conditions and the apparent substance abuse problems affecting both Juha and Anna. The household dynamics are strained due to the ongoing substance use, with Anna taking on a caregiver role while also struggling with her own addiction. This situation poses significant risks to their physical health, mental wellbeing, and overall quality of life.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Immediate referral for both Juha and Anna to undergo substance abuse assessments and, if necessary, enroll in appropriate treatment programs.
2. Collaborate with local social services and healthcare providers to ensure a coordinated approach to addressing their substance abuse issues and improving living conditions.
3. Provide ongoing support and follow-up visits to monitor progress, address any challenges that arise during the treatment process, and offer additional resources as needed.
4. Consider involving family members or trusted individuals who can provide emotional support and encouragement for Juha and Anna throughout their recovery journey.
5. Explore options for temporary housing arrangements if necessary to ensure a safe and substance-free environment for both individuals during the treatment process.
