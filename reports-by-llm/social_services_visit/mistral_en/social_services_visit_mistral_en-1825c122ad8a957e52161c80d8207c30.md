 **Social Services Visit Report**

**Visit Date:** 06.05.2025

**Location:** Sodankylä, Finland (Address: Keskuskatu 12, Apt. 3, Sodankylä)

**Visit Type:** Routine family wellbeing visit

**Household Composition:** Refugee family consisting of Mr. Ali Hassan (35), Mrs. Fatima Hassan (30), and their two children, Ahmed (8) and Aisha (6).

**Case Severity:** Low

**Summary of Visit Purpose:** The purpose of this visit was to conduct a routine assessment of the family's wellbeing in their temporary accommodation, ensuring they are adjusting well to their new environment and receiving necessary support services.

**Observations During the Visit:** Upon arrival, the Hassan family welcomed us warmly. The living conditions were clean and orderly, with evidence of attempts to create a homely atmosphere. Mr. Ali Hassan appeared calm and engaged during our conversation, expressing gratitude for the assistance provided thus far. Mrs. Fatima Hassan seemed preoccupied but open to discussing their experiences and concerns. Both children were playful yet well-behaved, demonstrating a positive adjustment to their new environment.

**Assessment:** The family's living conditions indicate a stable and low-risk situation. However, Mrs. Fatima Hassan expressed feelings of isolation due to language barriers and limited social interactions. This may impact her mental health and overall wellbeing over time. The children are adapting well but could benefit from additional support in integrating into the local school system.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up:** It is recommended that we arrange for an interpreter to facilitate better communication with Mrs. Fatima Hassan, addressing her feelings of isolation and exploring potential social support networks. Additionally, we will liaise with the local school to ensure a smooth transition for Ahmed and Aisha, potentially providing additional resources or tutoring if necessary.

A follow-up visit is scheduled for 20.06.2025 to assess the family's progress in these areas and adjust support services as needed.
