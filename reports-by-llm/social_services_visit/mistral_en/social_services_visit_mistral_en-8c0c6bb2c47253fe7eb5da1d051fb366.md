 Visit Report: Emergency Housing Verification - 19.01.2025

Location: S채kyl채, Finland

Client Name: Anna Lehto (36 years old) & Family
Address: Mannerheimintie 4A, S채kyl채, 28600

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct an emergency housing verification due to the urgent need for suitable accommodation for a teenage mother and her infant, who are currently residing with their parents. The case has been classified as moderate in severity, indicating a need for immediate intervention to ensure the well-being of all family members.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival at the residence, it was evident that the living conditions were cramped and not conducive to the needs of a growing family. The teenage mother, 18-year-old Emilia Lehto, appeared visibly stressed and overwhelmed by her responsibilities as a new parent. Her parents, Anna (36) and Jukka Lehto (42), seemed supportive but also showed signs of strain due to the additional burden on their household.

The infant was observed in a safe and clean environment, with essential items such as diapers, clothing, and feeding equipment readily available. However, it was clear that the family's financial situation is precarious, with limited resources for non-essential expenses. Emotional support appeared to be lacking, particularly for Emilia, who expressed feelings of isolation and anxiety about her new role as a mother.

Assessment:
The current living conditions are not sustainable in the long term, and there is a risk that the family's financial situation will further deteriorate without additional support. The emotional well-being of both Emilia and her parents is at risk due to the stressors associated with their circumstances. It is crucial to address these issues promptly to prevent any potential negative impacts on the family's overall health and stability.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Immediate referral for emergency housing assistance to secure suitable accommodation that can accommodate the growing family.
2. Connection with local social services for ongoing support, including financial aid, parenting classes, and mental health counseling for Emilia and her parents.
3. Coordination with healthcare providers to ensure the infant's regular check-ups and vaccinations are up-to-date.
4. Follow-up visit within two weeks to assess progress and address any remaining concerns or issues that may have arisen since the initial visit.

It is essential that we act swiftly to provide this family with the resources they need to stabilize their living situation and improve their overall well-being. By addressing their immediate needs, we can help alleviate some of the stressors they are currently facing and set them on a path towards long-term success.
