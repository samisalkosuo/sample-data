Location: Leppävirta, Finland
Visit Type: Immigration Case Monitoring Visit

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to monitor the progress and living conditions of the multi-generational household, which is currently undergoing immigration proceedings due to financial difficulties. The visit aimed to assess the family's situation, address any concerns, and provide necessary support or referrals.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, I was warmly greeted by the Matikainen family - Mr. Juhani (45), Mrs. Sanna (42), their daughter Ella (18), and Ella's son Leo (3). The family resides in a modest apartment located on Kauppakatu 20, Leppävirta. The living conditions were generally clean and well-maintained, with some signs of financial strain evident in the sparse furnishings and limited food supplies.

During our conversation, it became apparent that the family is struggling to make ends meet due to unemployment and limited income sources. Mr. Matikainen expressed his concerns about their immigration status and the potential impact on their livelihood. The emotional state of the family was generally stable, with a strong sense of resilience and determination to overcome their challenges.

Assessment:
The case severity is currently classified as low due to the family's cooperative attitude and willingness to seek assistance. However, the financial difficulties they are facing could potentially escalate if not addressed promptly. The family dynamics appear strong, with a supportive network among family members.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Referral to local employment services for job placement assistance for Mr. Matikainen.
2. Connection to food banks and other emergency aid resources to alleviate immediate financial strain.
3. Continued monitoring of the family's immigration case progress and providing updates on potential outcomes.
4. Scheduled follow-up visit in two months to assess the impact of the recommended actions and discuss any additional support needed.

It is essential that we continue to provide support and resources to help the Matikainen family navigate their current challenges and secure a stable future in their new home.
