 Title: Domestic Violence Risk Assessment Visit Report

Visit Date: 03.09.2024
Location: Evijärvi, Finland
Visit Type: Domestic Violence Risk Assessment

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct an urgent domestic violence risk assessment for the unaccompanied minor residing in temporary housing within Evijärvi. The assessment aimed to evaluate potential risks and family dynamics, with a focus on ensuring the safety and well-being of the minor.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival at the temporary housing facility, I was greeted by the unaccompanied minor, whom we will refer to as Elias Lappalainen (born 2008), residing at Kauppakatu 15, Evijärvi. Elias appeared visibly distressed and reluctant during our initial interaction. The living conditions were sparse but clean, with basic furniture and amenities provided by the temporary housing facility.

During our conversation, Elias shared concerns about his safety and well-being, citing frequent arguments and emotional abuse from his biological parents prior to their separation. He expressed fear of potential repercussions if they were to find out about our visit. It was evident that Elias had been deeply affected by the domestic violence he witnessed and experienced.

Assessment:
Given the case severity, the urgent risk assessment revealed a high likelihood of continued emotional abuse and potential physical harm towards Elias should he return to his biological family's household. The unaccompanied minor's emotional state and expressed fear further support this evaluation.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
In light of the findings, it is recommended that immediate steps be taken to ensure Elias' safety and well-being. This includes:

1. Permanent placement in a safe and supportive foster home, where he can receive ongoing emotional support and counseling services.
2. Legal action to secure a restraining order against his biological parents, preventing them from contacting or approaching Elias without prior approval from social services.
3. Collaboration with local schools to ensure Elias' academic progress is monitored and any necessary educational resources are provided.
4. Regular follow-up visits to assess Elias' emotional well-being and overall adjustment to his new living situation.

By taking these actions, we aim to provide Elias with a safe environment where he can heal and thrive, free from the threat of domestic violence.
