Location: Kirkkonummi, Finland

Client: Mr. Juhani Kiviranta (48) and Ms. Sanna Laine (46), shared custody of their son, Elias (12)
Address: Mannerheimintie 32, Apt. 5, Kirkkonummi, FI-02100

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct a disability support assessment for the minor child, Elias Kiviranta, who has been diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The visit aimed to evaluate the current living conditions and family dynamics, identify any potential risks or challenges, and provide recommendations for appropriate support services.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, it was noted that the apartment was clean and well-maintained. Mr. Kiviranta and Ms. Laine appeared to have a cordial but strained relationship, with occasional disagreements regarding Elias's care and education. Elias was observed to be engaging in repetitive behaviors and had difficulty maintaining eye contact during the conversation. He seemed anxious and required frequent reassurance from his parents.

Assessment:
The case severity of moderate complexity is primarily due to the challenges faced by Elias in managing social interactions, adapting to changes in routine, and exhibiting signs of anxiety and stress. The strained relationship between Mr. Kiviranta and Ms. Laine may also impact their ability to provide consistent support for Elias's needs.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Referral to a child psychologist for further assessment and development of an individualized behavioral intervention plan (BIP) for Elias.
2. Collaboration with Elias's school to ensure that they are equipped to address his unique needs and provide a supportive learning environment.
3. Family therapy sessions to improve communication and conflict resolution skills between Mr. Kiviranta and Ms. Laine, focusing on their shared responsibility in supporting Elias's well-being.
4. Regular follow-up visits to monitor progress, adjust support services as necessary, and provide additional resources for the family as needed.
5. Encourage participation in local Autism support groups to foster a sense of community and connect with other families facing similar challenges.

It is essential that Mr. Kiviranta, Ms. Laine, and Elias receive the necessary support to ensure his well-being and help him navigate the challenges associated with ASD. With appropriate interventions and resources, it is hoped that Elias can thrive in a supportive environment that caters to his unique needs.
