Client Information:
Name: Kaarina and Matti J채rvinen
Address: M채ntytie 2A, Savukoski, 97630

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to assess the grandparents' (Kaarina and Matti) ability to provide a safe and nurturing environment for their grandchildren, who are currently residing with them due to unforeseen circumstances. The evaluation aimed to determine if any additional support services or resources were necessary to ensure the well-being of all parties involved.

Observations During the Visit:
The J채rvinen household was clean and well-maintained, with a warm and inviting atmosphere. Kaarina and Matti demonstrated a strong bond with their grandchildren, displaying patience, love, and understanding throughout the visit. The children appeared happy, well-cared for, and engaged in age-appropriate activities.

During our conversation, both Kaarina and Matti expressed concern about their ability to meet the children's emotional needs as they navigate through this challenging period. They acknowledged that while they are managing well, they could benefit from additional resources and guidance to help them provide the best possible care for their grandchildren.

Assessment:
The case severity is low, given the positive living conditions and the apparent love and dedication of Kaarina and Matti towards their grandchildren. However, it is essential to address their concerns about meeting the children's emotional needs and provide them with the necessary support to ensure long-term success in this caregiving role.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Referral to a local family counselor for ongoing support and guidance on addressing the emotional needs of the grandchildren.
2. Provide resources for age-appropriate educational materials and activities to help stimulate the children's growth and development.
3. Schedule follow-up visits to monitor progress, address any emerging concerns, and ensure that Kaarina and Matti continue to receive the necessary support.
4. Encourage Kaarina and Matti to participate in local community events and activities designed for grandparents caring for their grandchildren to foster a sense of connection and support.

In conclusion, while the J채rvinen household is currently providing a safe and nurturing environment for their grandchildren, additional resources and support are necessary to help them meet the children's emotional needs and ensure long-term success in this caregiving role. With the recommended actions in place, we believe that Kaarina and Matti will continue to provide a loving home for their grandchildren while receiving the support they need to thrive.
