Visit Summary:
The visit was conducted on January 29, 2025, as part of the child visitation supervision program due to a moderate case severity involving Sari Järvinen caring for her grandchildren.

However, it was observed that the children appeared somewhat behind in their schoolwork, which may indicate a need for additional academic support. Additionally, there were concerns regarding Sari's ability to manage the financial aspects of caring for two grandchildren on her fixed income.

Assessment:
The living conditions and interactions between Sari Järvinen and her grandchildren during this visit suggest that they are managing well overall.
