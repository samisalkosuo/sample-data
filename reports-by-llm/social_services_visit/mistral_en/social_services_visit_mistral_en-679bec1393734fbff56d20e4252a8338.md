 Visit Report: Youth Mentoring Program Assessment - Pukkila, Finland (03.08.2024)

Client: Eero Kiviranta
Address: Mäkelänkatu 12, Apt. 5, Pukkila, 02600, Finland

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to assess the effectiveness and necessity of continued participation in the Youth Mentoring Program for Eero Kiviranta, a teenager with school attendance issues. The program aims to provide guidance, support, and improve academic performance through regular meetings with a mentor.

Observations During the Visit:
During the visit, Eero was observed to be welcoming and open to discussion. His living conditions were clean and well-maintained, indicating a supportive home environment. However, concerns were raised regarding his school attendance, which has been inconsistent over the past few months. Eero expressed feelings of frustration and disinterest in school, citing difficulties with certain subjects and a lack of motivation.

Assessment:
Given the low case severity, it is evident that Eero's situation requires attention but does not pose an immediate risk. His school attendance issues are likely due to academic struggles and a lack of engagement rather than external factors. The family dynamics appear supportive, and there is potential for improvement with targeted intervention.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
It is recommended that Eero continues participation in the Youth Mentoring Program to provide him with additional support and guidance. A mentor will work closely with Eero to identify areas of academic struggle and develop strategies to improve his motivation and engagement. Additionally, it would be beneficial for Eero to meet with a school counselor to discuss any specific challenges he may be facing and explore potential accommodations or resources that could help him succeed academically.

A follow-up visit will be scheduled in four weeks to assess the progress made by Eero and determine if further support is necessary. If Eero's school attendance does not improve, additional measures such as referrals to tutoring services or educational psychologists may be considered.

In conclusion, with continued participation in the Youth Mentoring Program and collaboration between Eero, his family, and school officials, it is hoped that Eero will overcome his academic challenges and find success in his educational pursuits.
