 Visit Report: Emergency Housing Verification - Soini, Finland (26.06.2025)

Client Name: Sari Kivimäki
Address: Miettisillankatu 12, Soini, 83700, Finland

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct an emergency housing verification for the multi-generational household of Sari Kivimäki, due to reported financial difficulties. The visit aimed to assess the living conditions and determine if immediate intervention or support services were necessary.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, I was greeted by Sari Kivimäki and her family, which consists of herself, her husband, their two children, and Sari's elderly mother. The household appeared to be well-organized, with a clean and tidy living space. However, it was evident that the family was struggling financially, as evidenced by worn furniture, limited food supplies, and the absence of certain essential items.

Sari and her husband were both cooperative during the visit, openly discussing their financial situation and expressing concern for their ability to provide for their family. Sari's mother appeared to be in good health but seemed isolated, spending most of her time in a separate room. The children, though visibly tired, were well-behaved and seemed content.

Assessment:
The case severity is low due to the family's cooperative nature and willingness to seek assistance. However, the financial difficulties are significant, and without intervention, the family may struggle to maintain their current living standards. The isolation of Sari's mother is a concern that requires attention to ensure her well-being and prevent potential health issues.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Immediate Financial Assistance: Provide short-term financial aid to help the family meet their basic needs while longer-term solutions are being explored.
2. Food Bank Referral: Connect the family with local food banks to supplement their current food supplies.
3. Social Services Case Management: Assign a case manager to work closely with Sari and her family, providing ongoing support and guidance as they navigate their financial challenges.
4. Home Repair Grants: Explore options for home repair grants to help replace worn furniture and essential items.
5. Senior Support Services: Refer Sari's mother to local senior services to address her isolation and ensure her overall well-being.
6. Follow-up Visit: Schedule a follow-up visit in two weeks to assess the family's progress and adjust support services as necessary.
