 Visit Report: Parental Capacity Evaluation - Case Number FIN-2025-RAU-001

Visit Date: 23.06.2025
Location: Rautalampi, Finland

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct a parental capacity evaluation for the young adult residing at the given address, in accordance with the specified visit type and case context. The assessment aimed to determine the individual's ability to provide a safe and nurturing environment for any potential future dependents.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, the client, identified as Mr. Juhani Mäki (25 years old), greeted us warmly and welcomed us into his clean and well-maintained one-bedroom apartment. The living conditions were satisfactory, with essential furniture and appliances present. Mr. Mäki demonstrated a positive demeanor throughout the visit, engaging in open and honest conversations about his personal life and aspirations.

During our discussion, it was evident that Mr. Mäki has been actively working on his education and career development, having recently completed a vocational training program and securing employment as a carpenter. He expressed a strong desire to start a family in the near future and demonstrated an understanding of the responsibilities associated with parenthood.

Assessment:
Given the low case severity, Mr. Mäki's living conditions, emotional state, and commitment to personal growth are all positive indicators of his potential as a parent. However, it is important to note that while he has shown maturity and responsibility in managing his own life, parenthood presents unique challenges that may require additional support and resources.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
In light of the assessment, we recommend that Mr. Mäki continue to focus on his education and career development while also seeking information about parenting classes and support services available in Rautalampi. We will schedule a follow-up visit within six months to reevaluate his progress and address any concerns or questions that may arise during this time.

It is our hope that with continued personal growth and access to appropriate resources, Mr. Mäki will be well-prepared to provide a safe and nurturing environment for any future dependents. We appreciate his cooperation during the visit and look forward to our next meeting.
