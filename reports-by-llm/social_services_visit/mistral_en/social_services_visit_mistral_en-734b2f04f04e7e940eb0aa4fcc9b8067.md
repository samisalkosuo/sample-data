Household Composition: Mr. Juhani Mäki (45 years old), a veteran with a substance use disorder, and his two children, aged 9 and 12.
Case Severity: Moderate

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct a routine check-in on the welfare of Mr. Juhani Mäki, a veteran struggling with substance abuse, and assess the impact on his children. The visit aimed to evaluate the current living conditions, identify any changes in the family's situation, and discuss potential support services or interventions.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, the house appeared clean but somewhat cluttered. Mr. Mäki greeted us warmly and seemed cooperative during the conversation. His children were present but appeared shy and withdrawn. Mr. Mäki openly discussed his struggles with alcohol addiction, expressing a desire to regain custody of his children and improve his life. However, he expressed concerns about maintaining sobriety due to stressors related to his military service.

Assessment:
The case presents moderate severity, as Mr. Mäki's substance use disorder has negatively affected his ability to care for his children effectively. The children's emotional state suggests they are experiencing distress due to their father's condition. It is crucial to address the underlying issues related to Mr. Mäki's military service and provide him with appropriate support services to aid in his recovery and improve family dynamics.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Refer Mr. Mäki to a local substance abuse treatment program specializing in trauma-informed care for veterans.
2. Arrange for temporary foster care for his children until Mr. Mäki completes the treatment program and demonstrates sustained sobriety.
3. Provide ongoing support and counseling services for both Mr. Mäki and his children to address any emotional or behavioral issues that may arise during this transition.
4. Schedule regular follow-up visits to monitor progress, assess the need for additional resources, and provide continued support as needed.
5. Collaborate with local veterans' organizations to ensure Mr. Mäki receives comprehensive care and assistance in reintegrating into society after treatment.
