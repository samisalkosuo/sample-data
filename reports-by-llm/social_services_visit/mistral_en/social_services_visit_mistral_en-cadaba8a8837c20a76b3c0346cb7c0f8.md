Client: Mr. Jari Mäki (45 years old)
Address: Tietotie 10 A, 46100 Kouvola, Finland

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct a follow-up on the domestic relocation of rehabilitated ex-offender Mr. Jari Mäki, as part of his reintegration into society. Given the high case severity, it is crucial to ensure that Mr. Mäki's transition proceeds smoothly and without any potential risks or complications.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival at the residence, I was greeted by Mr. Mäki who appeared calm and composed. The living conditions were clean and well-maintained, with essential amenities present. Mr. Mäki demonstrated a positive attitude towards his new environment, expressing gratitude for the opportunity to start anew.

During our conversation, Mr. Mäki shared that he has been actively seeking employment opportunities in the local area and has attended several job interviews. He also mentioned joining a local support group for ex-offenders, which he finds helpful in maintaining his mental wellbeing.

However, there were some concerns regarding his social interactions. Mr. Mäki mentioned having limited contact with family members due to strained relationships stemming from past incidents. This isolation could potentially impact his overall reintegration process and emotional state.

Assessment:
While Mr. Mäki's living conditions and compliance with rehabilitation requirements are encouraging, the high case severity necessitates continued monitoring of his social interactions and emotional wellbeing. The strained relationships with family members could potentially lead to stress or relapse if not addressed promptly.

1. Refer Mr. Mäki to a local counseling service specializing in family therapy, to help mend his relationships and provide emotional support.
2. Continue regular follow-ups to assess his progress in employment and overall reintegration process.
3. Encourage Mr. Mäki to maintain his involvement with the local support group for ex-offenders, as it provides a valuable network of peers who can offer understanding and guidance.
4. Schedule a follow-up visit within two months to evaluate the effectiveness of the recommended actions and adjust them if necessary.
