 **Social Services Visit Report**

Visit Date: 22.02.2025
Location: Sauvo, Finland (Address: Kauppakatu 12, Apartment 3B)
Visit Type: Routine Family Wellbeing Visit
Household Composition: Transitional housing residents post-rehabilitation - Mr. and Mrs. Sorsa (John and Anna Sorsa) with their two children, Elias (age 8) and Mia (age 6).
Case Severity: Moderate

**Summary of Visit Purpose**
The purpose of this visit was to conduct a routine wellbeing check on the Sorsa family, who are currently residing in transitional housing following their successful completion of rehabilitation programs. The aim was to assess their progress, address any concerns, and discuss potential next steps towards permanent housing.

**Observations During the Visit**
Upon arrival, the apartment appeared clean and well-maintained. The Sorsa family welcomed me warmly, with John and Anna both seeming calm and focused. The children were playful but well-behaved, demonstrating a positive adjustment to their new environment.

During our conversation, it was evident that the family has been making an effort to maintain their sobriety and adhere to the guidelines set during rehabilitation. John shared his plans for securing employment in the local construction industry, while Anna expressed her intention to enroll in a vocational training program for childcare.

However, there were some concerns regarding their financial situation. Despite both parents' efforts to find work, they have yet to secure stable income sources. This has led to occasional strains within the family, particularly when it comes to meeting basic needs and affording necessary expenses.

**Assessment**
While the Sorsa family has shown significant progress in their recovery, the moderate case severity remains due to their ongoing financial instability. The family's ability to secure permanent housing may be delayed if they are unable to find sustainable employment and manage their finances effectively.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**
It is recommended that we continue providing support services to the Sorsa family, including job placement assistance for John and Anna, as well as budgeting advice and financial aid resources. Additionally, it would be beneficial to schedule regular follow-up visits to monitor their progress and address any emerging concerns.

In light of their financial struggles, it is crucial that we expedite efforts to help them secure stable employment and income. This will not only improve their living conditions but also reinforce their commitment to maintaining their sobriety and rebuilding their lives.

It is my hope that with continued support and guidance, the Sorsa family will successfully transition out of transitional housing and into a more permanent living situation in the near future.
