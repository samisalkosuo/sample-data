 Visit Report: Newborn and Infant Safety Visit

Visit Date: 03.03.2025
Location: Lohja, Finland
Visit Type: Newborn and Infant Safety Visit
Household Composition: Single Father (Mr. Juhani Kiviranta) with one child (Baby Elias)
Case Severity: High

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to assess the safety and well-being of Baby Elias, born on 01.02.2025, in the care of his single father, Mr. Juhani Kiviranta. Given the high case severity, the visit aimed to evaluate the living conditions, parental capabilities, and identify any potential risks or concerns that may impact the infant's health and development.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival at the residence located at Mäkelänkatu 2A, Lohja, we found Mr. Kiviranta to be cooperative and open during our conversation. The living conditions were generally clean and well-maintained, with a designated space for Baby Elias's crib and essential baby items. However, there were some notable concerns regarding the lack of safety measures in place, such as unsecured electrical outlets and sharp objects within reach of the infant.

Mr. Kiviranta expressed feelings of stress and anxiety about his new role as a single father, which may have contributed to the observed lapses in safety precautions. He appeared emotionally vulnerable and overwhelmed by the responsibilities associated with caring for a newborn.

Assessment:
Given the high case severity and the identified risks, it is essential to provide Mr. Kiviranta with immediate support and resources to ensure Baby Elias's safety and well-being. The living conditions, while generally clean, demonstrate a lack of knowledge regarding infant safety measures that could potentially lead to accidents or injuries. Additionally, Mr. Kiviranta's emotional state suggests he may require additional assistance in managing the stressors associated with single parenthood.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Immediate referral to a local parenting support group to provide education on infant safety and developmental needs, as well as emotional support for Mr. Kiviranta.
2. Arrangement for a home safety assessment by a professional to identify and address any potential hazards within the living environment.
3. Follow-up visit within two weeks to assess progress in implementing safety measures and evaluate Mr. Kiviranta's understanding of infant care best practices.
4. Continued monitoring and support as needed to ensure the ongoing well-being of Baby Elias and his father.
