 **Social Services Visit Report**

Visit Date: 03.01.2025
Location: Juva, Finland (Address: Kauppakatu 24, Apt. 3, Juva)
Visit Type: Domestic Violence Risk Assessment
Household Composition: Family of five - Mr. Juhani Mäki (38), Mrs. Sanna Mäki (35), and children Elias (10), Leena (8), and Mikko (6)
Case Severity: Moderate

**Summary of Visit Purpose**

The purpose of this visit was to conduct a domestic violence risk assessment, given the reported instances of conflict within the household. The visit aimed to evaluate the current situation, identify potential risks, and assess family dynamics in order to determine appropriate next steps and support services.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival, the apartment appeared clean but somewhat cramped due to its subsidized size. The children were playing quietly in a corner while Mr. Mäki was present in the living room, and Mrs. Mäki was preparing dinner in the kitchen. Interactions between family members seemed strained, with minimal verbal communication.

Mr. Mäki displayed signs of frustration and irritability during our conversation, while Mrs. Mäki appeared anxious and submissive. The children were observed to be well-behaved but seemed to avoid direct eye contact with their father. Emotional state assessments revealed that all family members appeared stressed and overwhelmed by the current situation.

Notable concerns included Mr. Mäki's history of verbal abuse towards his wife, as well as a recent incident involving physical aggression towards Elias. The living conditions, while clean, were not conducive to a healthy family environment due to the lack of space and the palpable tension within the household.

**Assessment**

The case severity of moderate domestic violence indicates that immediate action is required to ensure the safety and well-being of all family members. The observed emotional state, strained interactions, and history of abuse suggest a high risk of further incidents if not addressed promptly.

Family dynamics appear to be characterized by power imbalances and poor communication, which contribute to the escalation of conflicts. The children's behavior and emotional responses indicate that they are affected by the domestic violence and may require additional support.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. Referral to a local counseling service for Mr. Mäki to address his aggressive behaviors and learn healthy conflict resolution strategies.
2. Domestic violence support group for Mrs. Mäki to empower her, provide emotional support, and help her develop a safety plan.
3. Family therapy sessions to improve communication, rebuild trust, and promote a healthier family environment.
4. Regular follow-up visits to monitor progress, assess risks, and adjust support services as necessary.
5. Temporary separation of Mr. Mäki from the household if further incidents occur or if there is evidence of noncompliance with recommended actions.
6. Collaboration with local schools to provide additional support for Elias, Leena, and Mikko, focusing on emotional well-being and conflict resolution skills.
7. Exploration of alternative housing options if the current living conditions continue to negatively impact family dynamics and safety.
