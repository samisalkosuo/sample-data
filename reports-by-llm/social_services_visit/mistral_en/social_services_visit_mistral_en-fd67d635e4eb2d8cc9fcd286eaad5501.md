 Visit Report: Newborn and Infant Safety Visit

Visit Date: 01.04.2025
Location: Kirkkonummi, Finland

Client Name: Eero Saarinen (68 years old)
Address: Mannerheimintie 32 A, Kirkkonummi, Finland

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to assess the safety and well-being of a newborn in the household, given the high case severity. The visit focused on evaluating the living conditions, parental capabilities, and identifying any potential risks or concerns that may impact the infant's health and development.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, it was noted that the living conditions were generally clean and well-maintained. However, there were some areas of concern regarding the safety of the newborn. The household consisted of Eero Saarinen, the elderly man, and his adult daughter who recently gave birth. The emotional state of both individuals appeared to be stable, but there was a noticeable lack of knowledge about infant care and safety practices.

Assessment:
Given the high case severity, it is evident that the household requires immediate support and guidance in ensuring the newborn's safety. The elderly man's age and limited understanding of infant care may pose challenges in providing adequate care for the newborn. Additionally, there were observed gaps in knowledge about safe sleeping practices, feeding schedules, and general childcare requirements.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Referral to a local parenting support group that offers education on infant safety and developmental needs.
2. Arrangement for home visits from a social worker specializing in newborn care to provide hands-on guidance and support.
3. Collaboration with healthcare professionals to ensure the newborn receives regular check-ups and vaccinations.
4. Follow-up visit within two weeks to assess progress and adjust recommendations as necessary.
5. Continued monitoring of the household's situation to address any emerging concerns or risks.
