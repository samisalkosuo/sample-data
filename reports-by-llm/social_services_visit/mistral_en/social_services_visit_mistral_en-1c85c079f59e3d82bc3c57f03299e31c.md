 **Social Services Visit Report**

Visit Date: 22.02.2025
Location: Kiuruvesi, Finland
Visit Type: Foster Family Evaluation
Household Composition: Refugee family - The Mohammeds (Ali, Fatima, and their two children, Aisha aged 7 and Hassan aged 4)
Case Severity: Urgent

**Summary of Visit Purpose**

The purpose of this visit was to conduct an urgent evaluation of the foster family's suitability to accommodate the Mohammed family, a refugee family currently in temporary accommodation. The urgency stems from the overcrowded conditions at the temporary shelter and the need for a more permanent solution.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival, the Mohammed family warmly welcomed us into their temporary living space. The apartment was modest but clean, with evidence of the family's efforts to create a homely environment for their children. The interactions between Ali and Fatima were respectful and affectionate, while Aisha and Hassan displayed a good level of adjustment considering their recent displacement.

However, concerns were noted regarding the limited space available, particularly in terms of bedroom accommodation. The family was sharing one bedroom, which could potentially impact their privacy and overall well-being. Additionally, the children's toys were scattered throughout the living room, suggesting a lack of organized play areas or storage solutions.

**Assessment**

While the Mohammed family appears to be adapting well under challenging circumstances, the current living conditions are not conducive to long-term foster care due to space constraints. The urgency of this case is further emphasized by the overcrowded temporary shelter where the family currently resides.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. Immediate relocation: Arrange for the Mohammed family's relocation to a larger foster home that can accommodate their needs more effectively.
2. Support services: Liaise with local schools and healthcare providers to ensure a smooth transition for the children, and provide additional resources as needed for the family's integration into Finnish society.
3. Follow-up visit: Schedule a follow-up visit within two weeks to assess the family's adjustment to their new living situation and address any remaining concerns.
