Location: Virolahti, Finland
Visit Type: Disability Support Assessment

Client Information:
Name: Elias Kivimäki
Address: Tietotie 12, Apt. 3, Virolahti, 57600

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct a disability support assessment for unaccompanied minor, Elias Kivimäki, who is currently residing in temporary housing in Virolahti. The assessment aimed to evaluate his needs, identify any potential risks, and determine appropriate support services to ensure his well-being and successful integration into society.

Observations During the Visit:
During the visit, Elias was observed to be a quiet and reserved individual who appeared to struggle with communication due to speech impediments related to his disability. His living conditions were found to be clean and well-maintained, with essential amenities readily available. However, it was noted that he seemed isolated and lacked social interaction, which may have contributed to his emotional state appearing somewhat subdued.

Assessment:
Given the case's severity as moderate, it is evident that Elias requires additional support to help him navigate through his daily life and integrate into society more effectively. The observed isolation and communication difficulties suggest a need for speech therapy and social skills development programs. Furthermore, the potential risks associated with his disability and lack of familial support necessitate ongoing monitoring and intervention to ensure his safety and well-being.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Refer Elias to speech therapy sessions to help improve his communication skills.
2. Arrange for social skills development workshops to facilitate interaction with peers and promote a more positive emotional state.
3. Schedule regular follow-up visits to assess progress, address any emerging concerns, and adjust support services as necessary.
4. Explore opportunities for permanent housing that can provide a supportive environment conducive to Elias's growth and development.
5. Collaborate with local schools to ensure appropriate accommodations are in place to support his learning needs.
6. Connect Elias with community resources, such as youth clubs or recreational activities, to foster social connections and combat isolation.
