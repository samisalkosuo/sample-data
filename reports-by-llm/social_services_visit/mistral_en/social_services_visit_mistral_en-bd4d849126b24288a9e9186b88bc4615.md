 **Social Services Visit Report**

Visit Date: 25.05.2025
Location: Petäjävesi, Finland
Visit Type: Newborn and Infant Safety Visit
Household Composition: Unaccompanied Minor (Emilia Kiviranta) in Temporary Housing
Case Severity: Moderate

**Summary of Visit Purpose**

The purpose of this visit was to assess the safety and well-being of Emilia Kiviranta, an unaccompanied minor residing in temporary housing, as part of our newborn and infant safety program. The visit aimed to evaluate living conditions, identify any potential risks, and provide necessary support services.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival, Emilia was observed to be calm and cooperative. The temporary housing unit appeared clean and well-maintained, with essential amenities such as a crib, high chair, and diapers provided. However, there were no age-appropriate toys or books available for the child's development. Emilia expressed feelings of loneliness due to being away from her family and lacked social interaction.

**Assessment**

The moderate case severity is primarily attributed to the unaccompanied status of the minor, which increases vulnerability and emotional distress. The living conditions are satisfactory but lack stimulating resources for Emilia's developmental needs. The absence of family support necessitates additional attention and support services.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. Provide age-appropriate toys, books, and educational materials to promote Emilia's cognitive and emotional development.
2. Arrange for regular play therapy sessions to address feelings of loneliness and help build coping mechanisms.
3. Facilitate contact with family members or potential guardians, if applicable, to explore possibilities for permanent housing arrangements.
4. Schedule follow-up visits to monitor Emilia's progress and adjust support services as needed.
5. Collaborate with local schools and community centers to establish a supportive network for Emilia's integration into the community.
