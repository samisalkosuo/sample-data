 **Social Services Visit Report**

Visit Date: 01.09.2024
Location: Petäjävesi, Finland
Visit Type: Child Visitation Supervision
Case Identifier: Jari Kivimäki (35)
Case Severity: Moderate

**Summary of Visit Purpose**

The purpose of this visit was to monitor the progress and living conditions of Mr. Jari Kivimäki, a rehabilitated ex-offender who is currently reintegrating into society following his release from prison. The visit aimed to assess his ability to provide a safe and stable environment for his child, as well as evaluate his compliance with the terms of his parole.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at Mr. Kivimäki's residence, I was greeted warmly by both Jari and his young daughter, Emilia (7). The living conditions appeared clean and orderly, with essential amenities present. Jari demonstrated a calm and attentive demeanor throughout the visit, engaging positively with Emilia and maintaining open communication during our conversation.

During our discussion, Jari shared details about his recent employment at a local construction company, expressing gratitude for the opportunity to rebuild his life. He also spoke candidly about his ongoing participation in support groups and counseling sessions, which he acknowledged as crucial components of his rehabilitation process.

**Assessment**

While Mr. Kivimäki's progress thus far has been encouraging, there are still concerns regarding the long-term sustainability of his reintegration. Given his history of substance abuse and previous offenses, it is essential to continue monitoring his behavior and ensuring that he maintains a strong support network to prevent relapse.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

In light of the moderate case severity, I recommend that Mr. Kivimäki continues participating in counseling sessions and support groups as part of his ongoing rehabilitation. Additionally, I suggest arranging regular follow-ups to assess his emotional state, living conditions, and compliance with parole requirements.

To further support Jari's reintegration, I propose connecting him with local resources such as job training programs, financial assistance, and family counseling services. This comprehensive approach will help ensure that Mr. Kivimäki has the tools and support necessary to maintain a stable and safe environment for his daughter while continuing on his path towards rehabilitation.
