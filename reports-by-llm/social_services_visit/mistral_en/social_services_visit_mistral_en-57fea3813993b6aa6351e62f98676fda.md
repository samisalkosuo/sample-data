Emotional state and behaviors appeared normal for the age group, with no notable concerns observed. The children were playful, well-behaved, and seemed to have a strong bond with their parents. There was evidence of open communication within the family, with both parents actively involved in their children's lives.

Given the positive outcome of this visit, no immediate actions are required at this time. However, it is recommended to schedule a follow-up visit in six months to reassess the family's situation and ensure that any potential issues or concerns are addressed promptly.

In addition, we will provide the Kivimäki family with resources for ongoing parenting support and advice, as well as information on local community services and activities that may benefit their children's development.

Overall, it was a pleasure to observe such a loving and engaged family, and we look forward to our next visit in six months.
