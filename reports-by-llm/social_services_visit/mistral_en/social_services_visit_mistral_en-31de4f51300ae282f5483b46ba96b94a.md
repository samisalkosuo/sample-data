Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct an initial assessment of the living conditions and emotional well-being of Elias Kivikoski, a 15-year-old unaccompanied minor residing in temporary housing. The visit aimed to gather information necessary for determining appropriate support services and establishing a case management plan.

Elias was found to be well-mannered, cooperative, and open during our conversation. He appeared to be adjusting reasonably well to his new environment, demonstrating an understanding of basic household responsibilities. The temporary housing unit was clean and adequately furnished, with a welcoming atmosphere. However, Elias expressed concerns about missing his family back home and the uncertainty surrounding his future.

Assessment:
Given the case severity of moderate, it is evident that Elias requires ongoing support to address emotional challenges associated with being an unaccompanied minor. The initial assessment indicates that he is coping relatively well in his temporary housing but may benefit from counseling services to help him process feelings of homesickness and anxiety about the future.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

2. Schedule regular follow-up visits to monitor his emotional well-being and progress in counseling.
3. Explore opportunities for Elias to connect with other unaccompanied minors in the area, fostering a sense of community and support.
4. Collaborate with school officials to ensure Elias is receiving appropriate academic support and assistance in navigating the educational system.
5. Continue working on securing permanent housing for Elias and his family, should they be able to join him in Finland.

It is essential that we continue to provide Elias with a supportive network as he navigates this challenging transition. Regular follow-up visits and ongoing access to counseling services will help ensure his emotional well-being and facilitate a successful integration into his new life in Orivesi, Finland.
