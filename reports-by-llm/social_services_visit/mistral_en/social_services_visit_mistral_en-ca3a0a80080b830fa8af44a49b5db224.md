Client Information:
Name: Sari Kivimäki
Address: Mannerheimintie 34, Apt. 2B, Salo, 26800

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct a follow-up on the parenting education program provided to Ms. Kivimäki, who is currently recovering from domestic abuse. The visit aimed to assess her progress, address any concerns, and provide additional support as needed.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, Ms. Kivimäki warmly welcomed the social worker into her home. The living conditions were clean and well-maintained, indicating a commitment to creating a safe and nurturing environment for herself and her child. Ms. Kivimäki appeared calm and focused during the conversation, demonstrating an increased understanding of healthy parenting practices and boundaries.

However, there were signs that she was still struggling with emotional trauma from the abusive relationship. She expressed occasional anxiety about potential repercussions or encounters with her former partner. Ms. Kivimäki also mentioned feeling isolated due to limited social interactions, which could potentially impact her mental health and overall well-being.

Assessment:
Given the low case severity, it is encouraging to see that Ms. Kivimäki has made significant strides in her recovery and parenting skills. However, the residual effects of domestic abuse and feelings of isolation suggest that additional support may be necessary to ensure her continued progress and well-being.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Refer Ms. Kivimäki to a local support group for survivors of domestic abuse to help address emotional trauma and provide a network of understanding peers.
2. Connect her with community resources for increasing social interactions, such as parenting groups, recreational activities, or volunteer opportunities.
3. Schedule regular follow-up visits to monitor her progress, address any concerns, and adjust support services as needed.
4. Continue providing parenting education and resources to reinforce positive parenting practices and promote a healthy home environment for both Ms. Kivimäki and her child.

In conclusion, while Ms. Kivimäki has made significant progress in her recovery from domestic abuse, additional support is required to address residual emotional trauma and feelings of isolation. By providing referrals to local resources and continuing regular follow-up visits, we can ensure that she receives the necessary assistance to maintain her progress and continue moving forward towards a healthier, more fulfilling life.
