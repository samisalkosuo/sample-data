The visit on August 11, 2024, was conducted to evaluate the living conditions and suitability of a single adult with intellectual disability, Mr. Eero Järvinen, as a potential foster parent. The case context involved moderate severity due to challenges in managing daily life tasks and emotional regulation.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, Mr. Järvinen welcomed us warmly and showed a clean, well-maintained apartment. He demonstrated an understanding of basic household chores but struggled with more complex tasks such as meal planning and budgeting. Emotionally, he appeared anxious and overwhelmed at times, particularly when discussing his ability to care for children. However, he expressed a genuine desire to provide a loving home.

Notable concerns included his difficulty in managing unexpected situations and his reliance on external support for decision-making. During the visit, it was observed that he struggled with maintaining consistent routines, which could potentially impact the wellbeing of any foster children.

Assessment:
Given the moderate case severity, it is essential to ensure a safe and supportive environment for potential foster children. Mr. Järvinen's intellectual disability presents challenges in managing daily life tasks and emotional regulation, which may pose risks to the children's wellbeing if not addressed.

3. Regular follow-up visits to monitor progress and address any emerging concerns or challenges.
4. Consideration of additional support services, such as a caregiver or respite care, to ensure the wellbeing of any potential foster children.
5. Assessment of Mr. Järvinen's readiness for fostering at regular intervals to determine if he is ready to take on the responsibilities of a foster parent.
