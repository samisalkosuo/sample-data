 Visit Report: Elderly Care Follow-up - 04.03.2025

Location: Kouvola, Finland
Visit Type: Elderly care follow-up

Client Name: Eero Saarinen (68 years old)
Address: Mannerheimintie 12 A, Kouvola, 46100

Household Composition: Two adult siblings sharing housing - Eero Saarinen and Liisa Saarinen (73 years old)
Case Severity: Moderate

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct a follow-up on the elderly care services provided to Mr. Eero Saarinen, who has been receiving assistance due to his age-related health issues and limited mobility. The visit aimed to assess the current living conditions, evaluate family dynamics, and discuss potential next steps in ensuring continued support for both Eero and his sister Liisa.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, it was evident that the living space was clean and well-maintained, with a noticeable effort made to accommodate Eero's mobility needs. Eero appeared calm and content during our conversation, expressing gratitude for the services provided. Liisa, his sister, seemed slightly anxious but otherwise coped well with her caregiving responsibilities.

During the visit, it was observed that Eero required assistance with daily activities such as bathing, dressing, and meal preparation. While Liisa demonstrated a strong commitment to caring for her brother, she expressed concerns about her own health and the strain of providing constant care.

Assessment:
The current living situation is manageable, given the cleanliness and adaptability of the home environment. However, the moderate case severity indicates that continued support is necessary to ensure both Eero's and Liisa's well-being. The emotional state of both individuals suggests a need for additional resources and respite care to alleviate some of the stress placed on Liisa as a primary caregiver.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Referral to a home health agency for additional assistance with daily living activities, allowing Liisa to take breaks from her caregiving responsibilities.
2. Exploration of respite care options, such as adult daycare services, to provide temporary relief for Liisa and promote her own well-being.
3. Scheduling a follow-up visit in two months to assess the impact of these recommendations and adjust support services as needed.
4. Encourage open communication between Eero, Liisa, and social service providers to ensure ongoing collaboration and support.

In conclusion, this visit provided valuable insights into the living conditions and family dynamics of Eero and Liisa Saarinen. The recommended actions aim to alleviate some of the stress placed on Liisa as a caregiver while ensuring continued support for both individuals. A follow-up visit will be scheduled in two months to assess the impact of these recommendations and adjust services accordingly.
