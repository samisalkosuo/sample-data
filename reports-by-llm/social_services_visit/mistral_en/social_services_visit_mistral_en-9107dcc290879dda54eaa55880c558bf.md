 **Social Services Visit Report**

**Visit Date:** 10.01.2025

**Location:** Kauhava, Finland

**Visit Type:** Emergency Housing Verification

**Household Composition:** The Al-Mansour family, consisting of Mr. Ahmed Al-Mansour (38), Mrs. Aisha Al-Mansour (35), and their three children: Omar (10), Fatima (8), and Hassan (6).

**Case Severity:** High

**Summary of Visit Purpose:** The purpose of this visit was to verify the living conditions of the Al-Mansour family, who are currently in temporary accommodation due to their refugee status. Given the high case severity, this visit aimed to assess the immediate needs and risks of the family, and to determine appropriate support services and follow-up actions.

**Observations During the Visit:** Upon arrival, the Al-Mansour family welcomed us warmly into their temporary apartment. The living conditions were modest but clean, with evidence of an ongoing effort to maintain a sense of normalcy for the children. Mr. Al-Mansour appeared visibly stressed, while Mrs. Al-Mansour was noticeably anxious during our conversation.

The family shared that they had fled their home country due to political unrest and violence, seeking safety in Finland. They expressed concerns about their future, particularly regarding employment opportunities, language barriers, and the children's integration into the Finnish school system. The emotional state of the family was understandably fragile, given the traumatic circumstances that led to their displacement.

**Assessment:** The Al-Mansour family is currently facing numerous challenges, including adjusting to a new culture, language barriers, and the emotional toll of their recent experiences. The high case severity is justified due to the family's vulnerability and the potential long-term impacts on their wellbeing if not addressed promptly.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up:** Immediate actions should include referrals for language classes, employment support services, and counseling for the entire family. Given the children's ages, it is crucial to expedite their enrollment in local schools to help them integrate and alleviate some of the family's stress.

A follow-up visit will be scheduled within two weeks to assess the family's progress and adjust support services as necessary. It is essential to maintain regular contact with the Al-Mansour family to ensure their needs are being met and to provide ongoing emotional support during this challenging transition period.
