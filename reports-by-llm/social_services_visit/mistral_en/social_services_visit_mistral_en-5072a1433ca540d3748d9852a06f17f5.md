 Title: Social Services Visit Report - Evij채rvi, Finland (25.07.2025)

Case Number: FIN-ES-2025-0034
Client Name: Juhani Kiviranta
Address: M채kel채nkatu 12, Apt. 3B, Evij채rvi, Finland

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was a follow-up on the school truancy report concerning Juhani Kiviranta, an ex-offender who is currently reintegrating into society. The aim was to assess his progress in addressing the issues that led to his truancy and evaluate his overall wellbeing and compliance with societal norms.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival at Mr. Kiviranta's residence, I found a clean and well-maintained apartment. Mr. Kiviranta greeted me warmly and appeared to be in good spirits. He was cooperative during our conversation and open about his experiences since our last meeting. It was evident that he has made an effort to engage with the local community, as he spoke fondly of his part-time job at a nearby grocery store.

However, concerns were raised regarding his son's attendance at school. Mr. Kiviranta acknowledged these issues but expressed difficulty in managing both work and ensuring his son's regular school attendance. He appeared remorseful about the situation and expressed a desire to find a solution that would benefit his son's education.

Assessment:
The case severity is currently low, as Mr. Kiviranta has demonstrated a commitment to reintegrating into society and maintaining a stable living environment. However, the ongoing issue with his son's school attendance poses a potential risk for future truancy or delinquency if not addressed promptly. The family dynamics seem to be coping well, but additional support may be necessary to help manage these challenges.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Refer Mr. Kiviranta and his son to a local family counselor for guidance on managing work-life balance and ensuring regular school attendance.
2. Schedule follow-up visits every two weeks to monitor progress and provide ongoing support as needed.
3. Collaborate with the school to develop an individualized education plan for Mr. Kiviranta's son, focusing on addressing any academic or behavioral concerns that may arise.
4. Continue monitoring Mr. Kiviranta's compliance with societal norms and provide additional resources or referrals as needed to support his continued reintegration into the community.
