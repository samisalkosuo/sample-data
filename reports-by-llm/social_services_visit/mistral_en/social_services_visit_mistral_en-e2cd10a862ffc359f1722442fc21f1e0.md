Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to evaluate the living conditions and family dynamics of the refugee family in temporary accommodation, as part of the foster family assessment process.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, the Ahmed family welcomed us warmly. The living space was clean and well-maintained, considering the temporary nature of their accommodation. The children were playful but well-behaved, demonstrating a good understanding of boundaries. Ali and Fatima appeared calm and open during our conversation, expressing gratitude for the support they have received since arriving in Finland.

Notable concerns included limited access to outdoor space due to the temporary nature of their accommodation and the children's lack of fluency in Finnish, which may impact their integration into the local school system. However, both parents expressed a strong commitment to learning the language and engaging with community resources.

Assessment:
The Ahmed family has shown resilience and adaptability since arriving in Finland. Their living conditions are satisfactory given the temporary nature of their accommodation, and they have demonstrated a positive attitude towards integrating into Finnish society. The case severity remains low due to the family's proactive approach and willingness to engage with support services.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Continue providing language support to improve the family's fluency in Finnish, which will aid their integration into the local community.
2. Explore options for securing more permanent accommodation that offers better access to outdoor spaces for the children.
3. Arrange meetings with local schools to discuss the children's educational needs and potential support services.
4. Schedule a follow-up visit in two months to assess progress and address any remaining concerns.
