 Title: Post-Abuse Recovery Support Visit Report

Visit Date: 24.04.2025
Location: Eura, Finland
Visit Type: Post-abuse recovery support visit

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to provide ongoing support and monitoring for the teenager in foster care (TIC), who has recently been removed from a potentially abusive home environment. The visit aimed to assess the TIC's progress in their recovery, evaluate living conditions, and discuss any concerns or challenges they may be facing during this transition period.

Observations During the Visit:
The TIC was observed to be in good spirits upon our arrival. They welcomed us warmly and appeared comfortable in their new foster home. The living conditions were clean, well-maintained, and suitable for a teenager. The TIC engaged in open dialogue during our conversation, expressing gratitude for the support they have received thus far. However, they did mention feeling occasional loneliness due to being away from their previous social circle.

Assessment:
The case severity is currently low, as the TIC has been removed from the abusive environment and appears to be adjusting well in their new foster home. The TIC's emotional state is generally positive, but it is important to address the feelings of loneliness they have expressed to ensure a smooth continuation of their recovery process.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Continue regular visits and check-ins with the TIC to provide ongoing support and monitor their progress.
2. Refer the TIC to local youth groups or clubs to help them build new social connections and alleviate feelings of loneliness.
3. Schedule a follow-up visit in two weeks to assess the impact of the recommended actions and discuss any further concerns or needs.
