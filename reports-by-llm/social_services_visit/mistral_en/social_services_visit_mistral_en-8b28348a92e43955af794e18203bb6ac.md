Visit Date: 10.11.2024
Location: Viitasaari, Finland
Visit Type: Disability Support Assessment

Client Name: Eero Järvinen
Address: Mäkelänkatu 23, Apt. 5, Viitasaari, Finland

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct a disability support assessment for Mr. Eero Järvinen, following recent custody changes within his blended family. Given the high case severity, it is crucial to evaluate the living conditions and emotional state of all parties involved, with a focus on providing necessary support services to ensure the well-being of all members.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, I was greeted by Eero's wife, Sanna, and their two children, aged 8 and 10. The living conditions were generally clean and well-maintained, but there appeared to be a noticeable strain in the family dynamics. Eero, who has been diagnosed with autism, seemed agitated and struggled to communicate effectively during our conversation. His son, who also has autism, exhibited similar behaviors, while his daughter seemed to be coping better.

Sanna expressed concerns about managing the household and providing adequate support for both Eero and their son, given her full-time employment as a teacher. She mentioned that they had recently experienced financial difficulties due to unexpected medical expenses related to Eero's condition.

Assessment:
The high case severity is primarily due to the complex needs of Eero and his son, coupled with Sanna's challenging work-life balance. The emotional state of all family members suggests that they are struggling to adapt to the recent custody changes and the increased demands on their resources.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Immediate financial assistance should be provided to alleviate the current financial strain, allowing Sanna to focus more on her family's needs.
2. Referrals for additional support services, such as occupational therapy and speech therapy, are necessary to help Eero and his son manage their autism symptoms more effectively.
3. A follow-up visit should be scheduled within two weeks to assess the impact of the recommended actions and determine if further interventions are required.
4. Collaboration with Eero's employer may be beneficial in exploring flexible work arrangements or accommodations that could help Sanna better manage her responsibilities at home and work.
5. Explore options for respite care to provide Sanna with temporary relief from her caregiving duties, allowing her to focus on her own well-being and stress levels.

In conclusion, it is essential to prioritize the needs of Eero Järvinen and his family, ensuring they receive the necessary support services to improve their living conditions and emotional well-being. The recommended actions aim to provide immediate relief while addressing the long-term challenges faced by this blended family.
