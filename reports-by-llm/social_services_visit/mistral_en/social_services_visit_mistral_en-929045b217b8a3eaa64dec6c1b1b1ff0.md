Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to assess the living conditions and provide emergency housing support for a vulnerable household in Kangasniemi due to an urgent case severity.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival at their residence, it was evident that the living conditions were substandard, with a lack of adequate heating, insulation, and essential household appliances.

The financial hardship they are experiencing has led to a decline in their quality of life and emotional state. The situation requires prompt intervention to ensure their safety and stability.

1. Emergency housing support: Arrange temporary accommodation for Mr. Antti and Ms. Liisa in a warm, safe, and secure environment until more permanent solutions can be found.
2. Financial assistance: Provide immediate financial aid to cover essential expenses such as heating, electricity, and food.
3. Employment support: Connect Ms. Liisa with local employment services to assist her in finding suitable work that accommodates her health needs.
