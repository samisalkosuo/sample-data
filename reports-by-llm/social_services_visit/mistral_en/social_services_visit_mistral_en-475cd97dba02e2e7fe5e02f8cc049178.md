 Visit Report: Newborn and Infant Safety Visit

Visit Date: 14.10.2024
Location: Laihia, Finland

Client Name: Sini Kivimäki (35 years old) & Juhani Mäki (37 years old)
Address: Metsänkartano 2, Laihia, 88600

Visit Purpose: The purpose of this visit was to assess the safety and well-being of the newborn infant in the household, given the cohabiting couple's mental health challenges. This visit type is part of our ongoing efforts to ensure the optimal environment for the growth and development of infants in our community.

Observations During the Visit: Upon arrival, both Sini and Juhani appeared welcoming and cooperative. The living conditions were clean and well-maintained, with a designated safe space for the infant's belongings. However, it was observed that Sini exhibited signs of anxiety and stress throughout the visit, while Juhani seemed preoccupied and less engaged in our conversation. Emotional support and resources were discussed as potential concerns, given their mental health challenges.

Assessment: The case severity is currently low due to the couple's proactive approach towards maintaining a clean and safe living environment for their newborn. However, the presence of ongoing mental health challenges may impact their ability to provide consistent emotional support and nurturing for the infant. It is essential to monitor this situation closely and offer additional resources if necessary.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up: In light of the observations made during the visit, it is recommended that Sini and Juhani be referred to a local mental health support group specializing in perinatal mental health. This service will provide them with the emotional support they need to navigate their current challenges while ensuring the best possible care for their newborn. A follow-up visit will be scheduled within two months to assess the impact of these recommendations and address any additional concerns that may arise.

In conclusion, this visit aimed to ensure the safety and well-being of the newborn infant in the household, given the cohabiting couple's mental health challenges. The living conditions were clean and safe, but emotional support and resources were identified as potential areas for improvement. Recommendations have been made, and a follow-up visit will be scheduled to assess progress and address any additional concerns that may arise.
