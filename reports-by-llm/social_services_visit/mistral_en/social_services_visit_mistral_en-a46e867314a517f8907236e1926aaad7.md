 Visit Report: Family Reunification Progress Check - Muhos, Finland (06.11.2024)

Client: Saku Virtanen
Address: Kauppakatu 15, Apt. 3, Muhos, Finland

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct a progress check on the family reunification process for Saku Virtanen, a teenager with school attendance issues, as part of our ongoing efforts to support his reintegration into society and ensure a stable living environment. Given the high case severity, it is crucial to monitor the situation closely and provide necessary interventions to mitigate potential risks and improve family dynamics.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival at Saku's residence, I was greeted by his mother, Liisa Virtanen, who appeared visibly stressed but cooperative. The living conditions were modest, with a clean and well-maintained apartment. However, it was evident that Saku's school attendance issues have been causing tension within the household. During our conversation, Saku displayed signs of frustration and reluctance to discuss his academic struggles. Emotional outbursts from both Saku and Liisa were observed throughout the visit, indicating a strained relationship between them.

Assessment:
The high case severity is primarily due to Saku's persistent school attendance issues, which have negatively impacted his educational progress and created tension within the household. The emotional state of both Saku and Liisa suggests that they are struggling to cope with the current situation, increasing the risk of further deterioration if left unaddressed. It is essential to provide additional support services to help alleviate the stress on the family and address the underlying causes of Saku's school attendance issues.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Refer Saku for counseling to help him cope with any emotional challenges that may be affecting his school attendance and overall wellbeing.
2. Arrange a meeting between Saku, Liisa, and a school counselor to discuss potential solutions for improving Saku's academic performance and addressing any barriers to attendance.
3. Provide additional resources and support for Liisa to help her manage the stress associated with Saku's school issues and maintain a stable living environment.
4. Schedule regular follow-up visits to monitor progress, assess the effectiveness of interventions, and adjust strategies as needed to ensure continued improvement in Saku's situation.
5. Collaborate with local educational and social service providers to ensure coordinated support for Saku and his family.

In conclusion, this visit highlighted the need for immediate intervention to address Saku's school attendance issues and improve family dynamics. By implementing the recommended actions, we aim to support Saku in his reintegration into society and help him achieve academic success while reducing stress on his family.
