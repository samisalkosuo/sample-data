 Title: Juvenile Probation Compliance Visit Report - 05.05.2025

Location: Ylitornio, Finland
Visit Type: Juvenile Probation Compliance Visit

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The visit was conducted to assess the compliance of the juvenile probation case (Client: Eero Kivim채ki, 16 years old) in light of the high case severity and the presence of an adult with a severe mental health condition within the household. The primary objective was to evaluate the living conditions, emotional state, and behavior of both the juvenile and the adult, ensuring the safety and well-being of all parties involved.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, it was evident that the living conditions were generally clean and orderly. Eero appeared calm and cooperative during our conversation, demonstrating a willingness to engage in discussions about his probation requirements. The adult residing in the household displayed signs of severe mental health issues, requiring ongoing support from local healthcare services.

During the visit, it was noted that Eero had been adhering to his probation terms, including school attendance and curfew compliance. However, there were concerns regarding the adult's ability to provide adequate supervision and emotional support for Eero, particularly in times of stress or crisis. The adult's mental health condition seemed to be affecting their capacity to manage daily responsibilities effectively.

Assessment:
The case severity is high due to the juvenile's involvement in a serious incident and the presence of an adult with severe mental health issues within the household. While Eero has been compliant with his probation terms, there are concerns about the long-term impact of living in such an environment on his emotional well-being and development. The adult's mental health condition requires ongoing support from healthcare services, which may affect their ability to provide a stable home for Eero.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Continue regular probation visits to monitor Eero's compliance with his probation terms and assess any potential risks or concerns.
2. Refer the adult for additional mental health support, including therapy and medication management, to ensure they can manage their condition effectively and provide a stable home environment for Eero.
3. Consider exploring alternative living arrangements for Eero, such as foster care or a supportive housing program, to ensure his long-term emotional well-being and development are prioritized.
4. Schedule follow-up visits with both the juvenile and adult to assess progress and adjust support services as necessary.
