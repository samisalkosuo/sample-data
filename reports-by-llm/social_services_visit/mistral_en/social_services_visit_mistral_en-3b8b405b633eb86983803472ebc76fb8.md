 Title: Social Services Visit Report - Vimpeli, Finland (15.05.2025)

Client: Jari and Sini Kivimäki
Address: Mäkelänkatu 23, Apt. 4, Vimpeli, Finland

Visit Purpose:
The visit was conducted to assess the young couple's readiness for parenthood as part of a youth mentoring program, given the high case severity and impending birth of their first child.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, Jari and Sini welcomed us warmly. The living conditions were modest but clean, with signs of preparation for the upcoming birth. Both individuals appeared anxious yet eager to learn. They demonstrated a willingness to engage in discussions about parenting responsibilities, child development, and available support services. However, concerns were noted regarding their financial stability, as they expressed uncertainty about securing steady employment before the baby's arrival.

Assessment:
The case severity is primarily due to the couple's lack of experience with parenthood and potential financial instability. The emotional state of both Jari and Sini suggests a readiness to learn and adapt, but they may require additional support to ensure a smooth transition into parenthood.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Referral to financial aid programs to address their immediate financial concerns.
2. Enrollment in a comprehensive parenting education course to equip them with essential skills and knowledge for raising a child.
3. Regular follow-ups to monitor their progress, provide ongoing support, and address any emerging issues or concerns.
4. Collaboration with local employers to facilitate job opportunities for Jari and Sini.
5. Connection with a mentor family who can offer guidance and emotional support during this critical period.

In conclusion, while the case presents challenges, the couple's willingness to learn and adapt offers hope for a successful outcome. With appropriate support and resources, we believe they can overcome their current difficulties and provide a nurturing environment for their child.
