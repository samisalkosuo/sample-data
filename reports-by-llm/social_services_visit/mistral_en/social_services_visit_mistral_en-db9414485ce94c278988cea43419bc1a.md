 Title: Domestic Violence Risk Assessment Visit Report

Visit Date: 31.07.2025
Location: Jyväskylä, Finland
Visit Type: Domestic Violence Risk Assessment
Household Composition: Transitional housing residents post-rehabilitation (Mr. and Mrs. Sorsa, pseudonyms)
Case Severity: Moderate

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct a risk assessment for potential recurrence of domestic violence within the household of Mr. and Mrs. Sorsa, following their successful completion of rehabilitation programs. The visit aimed to evaluate their progress, identify any residual risks, and provide recommendations for ongoing support services.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, both Mr. and Mrs. Sorsa appeared calm and cooperative. The living conditions in the transitional housing unit were clean and well-maintained, with no visible signs of conflict or tension. During our conversation, Mr. Sorsa expressed remorse for his past actions and acknowledged the need for continued counseling to manage anger and stress effectively. Mrs. Sorsa appeared emotionally stable but voiced concerns about potential triggers that could lead to relapses in her partner's behavior.

Assessment:
The moderate case severity indicates a history of repeated incidents, which has been successfully addressed through rehabilitation. However, the presence of residual risks necessitates ongoing monitoring and support. The couple's openness to continued counseling and their commitment to maintaining a violence-free home are positive signs. Nevertheless, Mrs. Sorsa's concerns about potential triggers warrant further investigation and risk mitigation strategies.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Continued participation in anger management and stress coping workshops for Mr. Sorsa to reinforce the skills learned during rehabilitation.
2. Provide ongoing counseling sessions for both Mr. and Mrs. Sorsa to address any remaining emotional issues and develop a plan for managing potential triggers.
3. Regular follow-up visits to monitor progress, assess risk levels, and offer additional support as needed.
4. Referral to financial aid services to ensure stable financial circumstances, which can contribute to reducing stress and the likelihood of relapse.
5. Collaborate with local community resources to establish a support network for the couple, promoting a violence-free lifestyle and providing opportunities for social integration.

In conclusion, while the Sorsas have made significant strides in addressing their domestic violence issues, ongoing monitoring and support are essential to ensure a sustainable, violence-free future. The recommended actions aim to reinforce positive changes, address residual risks, and provide the necessary resources for continued success.
