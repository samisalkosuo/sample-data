Client Information:
Name: Juhani Kivinen
Address: Lumikko 3A, 96200 Rovaniemi
Household Composition: Blended family consisting of Juhani (45), his wife Sanna (42), their daughter Ella (12), and Juhani's son Max (17) from a previous relationship who recently moved in following custody changes.
Case Severity: Moderate

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct a check-in on the wellbeing of Mr. Kivinen, a veteran, and his family, given the recent changes in their household composition and the moderate case severity. The visit aimed to assess the current situation, identify any potential risks or concerns, and discuss appropriate support services to ensure a smooth transition for all members involved.

Observations During the Visit:
The Kivinen family welcomed me warmly into their home. Juhani appeared calm but slightly anxious, while Sanna seemed supportive and attentive. Ella was playful and Max, though initially reserved, opened up during our conversation. The living conditions were clean and well-maintained, with a noticeable presence of military memorabilia throughout the house, reflecting Juhani's service history.

During our discussion, it became apparent that the recent custody changes had caused some stress within the family, particularly for Max who was adjusting to living in a new environment. Juhani expressed concerns about his ability to balance work, family responsibilities, and his ongoing struggles with PTSD. Sanna shared her worries about managing the financial implications of supporting an additional household member.

Assessment:
The Kivinen family is currently navigating through a period of significant change, which has increased their vulnerability and stress levels. Juhani's PTSD, combined with his new responsibilities as a stepfather, presents a complex set of challenges that require professional support. Sanna's concerns about finances indicate the need for financial assistance or budgeting advice. Max's adjustment issues suggest that additional resources may be necessary to help him cope with this transition.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Refer Juhani to a local mental health professional specializing in PTSD treatment, to address his ongoing struggles and provide coping strategies for managing stress.
2. Connect the family with a financial advisor who can offer budgeting advice and explore potential sources of additional income.
3. Arrange for Max to meet with a counselor or youth worker to help him process his feelings about the custody changes and adapt to his new living situation.
4. Schedule regular follow-up visits to monitor the family's progress, assess the effectiveness of the recommended actions, and adjust support services as needed.
5. Encourage open communication within the family and emphasize the importance of seeking help when faced with challenges.

By addressing these issues proactively, we aim to improve the wellbeing of the Kivinen family and ensure a smoother transition for all members involved.
