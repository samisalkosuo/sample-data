 Title: Child Visitation Supervision Report - 02.07.2025

Client Information:
Name: Signe Järvinen
Address: Mäkelänkatu 12, Petäjävesi, Finland

Visit Summary:
The visit was conducted on July 2nd, 2025, as part of the child visitation supervision program due to the urgent case severity. The purpose of this visit was to assess the living conditions and well-being of the child in the care of elderly couple, Signe Järvinen and her husband.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, the house appeared clean and well-maintained, with a warm and inviting atmosphere. The couple greeted me cordially and welcomed me into their home. The child, a 7-year-old girl named Elina, was playing quietly in her room.

During our conversation, Signe expressed concern about managing the child's emotional needs while also dealing with the physical demands of aging. She appeared visibly stressed but determined to provide the best care possible for Elina. The couple demonstrated a strong bond with Elina, who seemed happy and well-adjusted.

However, there were some notable concerns regarding the child's safety. The staircase lacked a railing, which could potentially pose a risk for Elina. Additionally, the kitchen knives were not stored in a child-proof location.

Assessment:
Given the urgent case severity, it is essential to address these safety concerns promptly to ensure the well-being of Elina. The elderly couple is facing challenges in managing both their own needs and those of the child. While they demonstrate a strong bond with Elina, additional support may be necessary to alleviate some of the stressors they are experiencing.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Install a railing on the staircase to prevent potential accidents.
2. Provide education on childproofing the home and storage solutions for kitchen utensils.
3. Refer Signe to local support groups for elderly caregivers to help alleviate some of the stressors she is experiencing.
4. Schedule a follow-up visit within two weeks to assess the implementation of these recommendations and discuss any additional concerns or needs.

It is crucial that we continue to monitor this situation closely to ensure the well-being of Elina and provide necessary support to Signe and her husband as they navigate their role as caregivers.
