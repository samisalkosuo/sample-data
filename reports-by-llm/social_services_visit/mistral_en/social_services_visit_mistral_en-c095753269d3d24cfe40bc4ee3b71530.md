Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to evaluate the potential foster family for unaccompanied minor, Elias Kivimäki, who is currently in temporary housing. The assessment aimed to determine if the foster family can provide a safe, nurturing environment that meets the emotional, physical, and educational needs of the minor.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, the foster family warmly welcomed us into their home. The living conditions were clean, well-maintained, and suitable for a child. Elias was present during the visit and appeared to interact positively with the foster parents. He seemed comfortable in the environment and engaged in conversation without signs of distress.

The foster parents demonstrated an understanding of the challenges that come with fostering an unaccompanied minor and expressed a genuine desire to support Elias's transition into their family. They discussed their plans for helping him adapt, including enrolling him in local schools and providing access to counseling services if needed.

Assessment:
Based on the moderate case severity, it is essential that Elias be placed in a supportive and stable environment. The foster family appears capable of meeting his needs, as they demonstrated empathy, understanding, and a willingness to learn about his background and experiences. However, further evaluation may be necessary to ensure that they can provide the necessary emotional support during potential periods of stress or difficulty.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
Given the positive interactions observed during the visit, it is recommended that Elias Kivimäki be placed with the foster family in Pelkosenniemi. To further support the transition and ensure the success of the placement, we recommend the following actions:

1. Continue providing counseling services to both Elias and the foster family to address any potential emotional challenges that may arise during the adjustment period.
2. Arrange for regular follow-up visits to monitor the progress of the placement and ensure that the needs of all parties are being met.
3. Facilitate enrollment in local schools and provide additional educational support if necessary to help Elias acclimate to his new environment.
4. Offer ongoing training and resources to the foster family to enhance their ability to care for an unaccompanied minor, including information on cultural sensitivity, trauma-informed care, and communication strategies.

By implementing these recommendations, we aim to ensure a successful placement for Elias Kivimäki and provide him with a supportive, nurturing foster family in Pelkosenniemi, Finland.
