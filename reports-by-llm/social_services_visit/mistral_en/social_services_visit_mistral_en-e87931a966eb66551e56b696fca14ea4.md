 Visit Report

Visit Date: 13.12.2024
Location: Alavus, Finland
Visit Type: At-risk youth intervention visit

Client Information:
Name: Mohammad Ali Khalili
Address: Mäkelänkatu 5A, 87600 Alavus

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to assess the wellbeing of the recently relocated immigrant family, specifically focusing on their at-risk youth, Mr. Mohammad Ali Khalili. The case severity is moderate due to concerns about cultural adjustment, academic performance, and potential social isolation.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, the living conditions were found to be clean and well-maintained. The family appeared welcoming and cooperative during the visit. Mr. Khalili, a 15-year-old student, was observed to be quiet and reserved, showing signs of emotional distress. He expressed difficulties adapting to the new school environment and feeling disconnected from his peers.

Assessment:
The family's recent relocation has undoubtedly contributed to Mr. Khalili's struggles with cultural adjustment and academic performance. His emotional state suggests that he may be experiencing social isolation, which could exacerbate existing challenges. The case severity is moderate due to these factors but does not currently pose an immediate risk to the family's wellbeing.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Refer Mr. Khalili to a local counselor specializing in cultural adjustment and youth mental health issues for ongoing support.
2. Collaborate with his school to identify any academic support services that may be beneficial, such as tutoring or mentorship programs.
3. Arrange follow-up visits every two weeks to monitor progress and adjust recommendations as necessary.
4. Explore opportunities for Mr. Khalili to engage in local youth groups or activities to foster social connections.
5. Provide the family with resources on Finnish culture, language classes, and community events to facilitate integration.

By addressing these areas of concern, we aim to support Mr. Khalili's successful adaptation to his new environment and mitigate potential risks associated with cultural adjustment and social isolation.
