 Visit Report: Newborn and Infant Safety Visit

Visit Date: 09.01.2025
Location: Vieremä, Finland

Client Name: Sari Kivimäki (38 years old)
Address: Metsänkuja 2, Vieremä, Finland

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct a newborn and infant safety assessment in the context of a blended family with recent custody changes. Given the high case severity, it is crucial to ensure the well-being and safety of the newborn and all household members.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, Sari Kivimäki welcomed the social worker warmly. The living conditions were generally clean and orderly, but there were signs of stress and tension within the household. The newborn appeared to be well-cared for, with appropriate feeding and diapering schedules in place. However, there was a noticeable lack of babyproofing measures, particularly around electrical outlets and sharp objects.

Sari seemed emotionally distressed during the visit, expressing concerns about managing the transition and balancing her responsibilities towards her newborn and older children from a previous relationship. There were also indications of potential communication issues between Sari and her partner, who was not present during the visit.

Assessment:
The high case severity is primarily due to the blended family dynamics and recent custody changes, which can lead to increased stress and potential conflicts. The lack of babyproofing measures poses a risk to the newborn's safety, and the emotional distress displayed by Sari may impact her ability to provide consistent and appropriate care for the infant.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Immediate installation of babyproofing measures to ensure the newborn's safety.
2. Referral to a family counselor to address communication issues between Sari and her partner, as well as to provide emotional support for Sari during this transitional period.
3. Regular follow-up visits to monitor the situation and assess progress in implementing recommended actions.
4. Provision of resources and information on infant care and development to support Sari in her role as a new mother.

It is essential that these recommendations are addressed promptly to ensure the well-being and safety of the newborn and all household members. Further visits will be scheduled to assess progress and provide ongoing support as needed.
