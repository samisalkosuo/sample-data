 Visit Report

Visit Date: 28.11.2024
Location: Hollola, Finland
Visit Type: Youth Mentoring Program Assessment

Client Information:
Name: Eero Kivimäki
Address: Kaukokatu 3A, Hollola, Finland

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to assess the effectiveness and suitability of the youth mentoring program for Eero Kivimäki, a minor living with his adult guardian who is dealing with severe mental health issues. The visit aimed to evaluate the impact of the program on Eero's well-being, social interactions, and overall development.

Observations During the Visit:
During the visit, Eero was observed to be engaging positively with his mentor, displaying improved social skills and a more confident demeanor. The living conditions were clean and well-maintained, with evidence of regular meals being provided. However, there were signs of stress and tension in the household, potentially stemming from the guardian's mental health condition. Eero seemed to be managing these circumstances admirably, demonstrating resilience and maturity beyond his years.

Assessment:
Given the low case severity, it appears that the youth mentoring program is providing beneficial support for Eero. His interactions with his mentor suggest a positive influence on his personal development. However, the ongoing mental health issues of his guardian may require additional attention to ensure a stable and nurturing environment for Eero.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
It is recommended that we continue the youth mentoring program for Eero, as it seems to be having a positive impact on his life. Additionally, it would be beneficial to arrange counseling sessions for the guardian to address their mental health concerns and create a more stable home environment for Eero. A follow-up visit will be scheduled in three months to reassess the situation and adjust support services as necessary.

In conclusion, while there are still challenges to be addressed, the current youth mentoring program appears to be beneficial for Eero's development. With additional support for his guardian, we can work towards creating a more stable and supportive home environment for him.
