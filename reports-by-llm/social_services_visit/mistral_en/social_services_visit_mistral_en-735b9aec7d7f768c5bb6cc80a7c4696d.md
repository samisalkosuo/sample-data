 Title: Parental Capacity Evaluation Visit Report

Visit Date: 31.03.2025
Location: Rautjärvi, Finland
Visit Type: Parental Capacity Evaluation

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to assess the parental capacity of the adult daughter (Ms. Liisa Mäki, age 42) living with her elderly father (Mr. Juhani Mäki, age 75) in Rautjärvi, Finland. The urgency of the case stems from concerns regarding the well-being and safety of a minor child residing within the household.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, the living conditions were found to be clean and well-maintained, with adequate facilities for the needs of both Mr. Mäki and Ms. Mäki. The interaction between father and daughter appeared cordial, but there was a noticeable strain in their relationship, particularly regarding the care and upbringing of the minor child.

Ms. Mäki demonstrated signs of stress and exhaustion, which may be attributed to her dual role as a caregiver for her elderly father and a parent to the young child. Mr. Mäki, on the other hand, seemed withdrawn and disengaged from daily activities, relying heavily on his daughter for support.

The minor child was observed to be well-behaved but appeared emotionally distressed at times, particularly when interacting with her father. There were concerns raised regarding Mr. Mäki's ability to provide emotional support and appropriate guidance for the child.

Assessment:
Given the case severity, it is evident that there are significant risks to the well-being and safety of the minor child within this household. The strain in the relationship between Ms. Mäki and her father, coupled with Mr. Mäki's emotional detachment and potential inability to provide adequate parental support, poses a threat to the child's emotional development.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
It is recommended that immediate steps be taken to ensure the safety and well-being of the minor child. This includes arranging for temporary removal of the child from the household while further assessments are conducted and appropriate support services are put in place.

For Mr. Mäki, it is suggested that he receives additional care and support to address his emotional needs and improve his overall quality of life. This may include home care services, counseling, or referral to a daycare center for social interaction.

For Ms. Mäki, it is crucial to provide her with resources and support to manage the dual roles of caregiver and parent effectively. This could involve family therapy sessions, parenting classes, or respite care services to help alleviate stress and ensure the child's needs are met.

A follow-up visit will be scheduled within two weeks to assess the progress made in implementing these recommendations and to reassess the situation regarding the minor child's well-being.
