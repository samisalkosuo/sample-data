Client Information:
Name: Elias Kivimäki

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to assess the compliance and progress of unaccompanied minor, Elias Kivimäki, under juvenile probation in temporary housing. Given the high case severity, it is crucial to ensure a safe and supportive environment for Elias during his rehabilitation process.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival at Tietotie 3A, I was greeted by Elias who appeared calm and cooperative throughout the visit. The temporary housing unit was clean and well-maintained, with essential amenities available. Elias shared that he has been adjusting to his new living situation and is making an effort to adhere to the terms of his probation.

During our conversation, I observed a noticeable improvement in Elias' emotional state compared to previous visits. He expressed a willingness to engage with social workers and participate in counseling sessions. However, concerns were raised regarding his interactions with other residents at the temporary housing unit, as there have been reports of minor altercations.

Assessment:
While Elias has shown progress in complying with the terms of his probation and improving his emotional state, the ongoing issues with other residents pose a potential risk to his rehabilitation process. The high case severity necessitates continued monitoring and support to ensure a successful outcome for Elias.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Refer Elias to conflict resolution workshops to help manage interpersonal conflicts within the temporary housing unit.
2. Schedule regular follow-up visits to assess his progress and address any emerging concerns.
3. Collaborate with the probation officer to ensure that Elias continues to adhere to the terms of his probation.
4. Explore potential options for permanent housing, taking into account Elias' needs and ongoing case management requirements.
5. Continue providing emotional support and counseling services as needed.
