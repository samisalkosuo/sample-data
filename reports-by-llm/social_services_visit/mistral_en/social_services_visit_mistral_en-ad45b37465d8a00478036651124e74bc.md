Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to provide post-abuse recovery support to Mr. Mäki, a single adult residing in Keitele, Finland. Given the high case severity, the visit aimed to assess his current living conditions, emotional state, and overall wellbeing following recent traumatic events.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, I was greeted by Mr. Mäki who appeared visibly anxious but willing to engage in conversation. His apartment was clean and well-maintained, with necessary adaptations for his physical disability. However, there were signs of emotional distress, such as disorganized personal belongings and a noticeable lack of social interaction or engagement. During our discussion, Mr. Mäki expressed feelings of isolation, fear, and guilt, which are common reactions to abuse.

Assessment:
Given the high case severity, it is evident that Mr. Mäki requires immediate and ongoing support to ensure his safety, emotional wellbeing, and recovery. The living conditions appear suitable for his physical needs, but the emotional state indicates a need for professional counseling and psychological support. Additionally, the lack of social interaction suggests a potential need for community integration programs or peer support groups.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Refer Mr. Mäki to a local psychologist specializing in trauma recovery for ongoing counseling sessions.
2. Collaborate with local organizations to identify suitable peer support groups or community integration programs that cater to individuals recovering from abuse.
3. Schedule regular follow-up visits to monitor his progress, provide additional support, and adjust recommendations as necessary.
4. Liaise with healthcare providers to ensure Mr. Mäki's physical health is being addressed concurrently.
5. Explore the possibility of home care services or personal assistance to alleviate some of the stressors associated with his physical disability.

In conclusion, it is crucial that we continue to provide support and resources to Mr. Mäki during this critical period in his recovery. By addressing his emotional needs, fostering social connections, and ensuring his physical wellbeing, we can help him rebuild his life following the traumatic events he has experienced.
