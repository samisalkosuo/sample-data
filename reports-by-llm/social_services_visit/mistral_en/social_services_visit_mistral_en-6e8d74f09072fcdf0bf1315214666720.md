 Visit Report

Visit Date: 26.06.2025
Location: Raisio, Finland
Visit Type: Safety Plan Monitoring Visit

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to assess the safety and well-being of the cohabiting couple, Mr. and Mrs. Sointu (address redacted for privacy), who have been identified as having mental health challenges and are currently under our case management due to the urgent nature of their situation. The visit aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the safety plan implemented during our previous intervention, monitor the progress of the clients, and identify any potential risks or concerns that may require immediate attention.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, both Mr. and Mrs. Sointu appeared visibly anxious but cooperative. The living conditions were generally clean and well-maintained, with evidence of ongoing efforts to create a safe and supportive environment for both individuals. However, during our conversation, it became apparent that Mrs. Sointu has been experiencing increased symptoms of anxiety and depression, which have been exacerbated by financial stress due to unexpected medical expenses. Mr. Sointu, on the other hand, displayed signs of improved mental health but still struggles with managing his emotions in high-stress situations.

Assessment:
The current situation presents a significant risk to the emotional and physical well-being of both individuals, particularly Mrs. Sointu, who has shown a marked deterioration in her mental health since our last visit. The financial stress compounded with her mental health issues creates a volatile environment that could potentially lead to escalated conflicts between the couple.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Immediate referral for Mrs. Sointu to a mental health professional specializing in anxiety and depression, with a focus on providing support for managing her symptoms and addressing the financial stressors that have contributed to her decline.
2. Ongoing monitoring of Mr. Sointu's emotional state and continued encouragement to seek support when needed, particularly during high-stress situations.
3. Regular follow-up visits to assess the progress of both individuals and adjust the safety plan as necessary to ensure their continued well-being.
4. Exploration of potential financial assistance options for the Sointus to alleviate some of the current financial burden and reduce stress levels in the household.

It is crucial that we continue to provide support and resources to this vulnerable household, given the urgent nature of their case and the significant risks they face. Regular follow-up visits and ongoing communication with mental health professionals will be essential in ensuring the safety and well-being of Mr. and Mrs. Sointu.
