 Title: Homeless Outreach Visit Report - 29.06.2025

Location: Hattula, Finland
Visit Type: Homeless outreach visit
Case Subject: Emma Kiviranta (21 years old) - Former Foster Care Recipient
Case Severity: Moderate

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct an outreach assessment for Emma Kiviranta, a youth who recently aged out of the foster care system and is currently homeless. The visit aimed to evaluate her living conditions, emotional state, and identify potential risks or concerns that may require immediate attention or further support services.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon locating Ms. Kiviranta in a public park, she appeared visibly anxious and withdrawn. Her physical appearance suggested a lack of proper nutrition and hygiene, with signs of exhaustion evident in her demeanor. The living conditions were makeshift, consisting of a small tent and minimal personal belongings. During our conversation, Ms. Kiviranta expressed feelings of isolation, fear, and hopelessness about her current situation. Notable concerns included her emotional well-being, lack of stable housing, and limited access to essential resources such as food, healthcare, and employment opportunities.

Assessment:
Given the moderate case severity, it is evident that Ms. Kiviranta requires immediate support to address her homelessness and improve her overall well-being. The emotional state she presented during our visit indicates a need for counseling or mental health services to help cope with feelings of isolation and hopelessness. Additionally, her lack of stable housing necessitates finding appropriate shelter and securing long-term housing solutions.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Refer Ms. Kiviranta to local mental health services for counseling and emotional support.
2. Collaborate with local shelters to secure temporary housing while working towards long-term solutions, such as subsidized housing or transitional living programs.
3. Connect her with employment resources and job training opportunities to increase her chances of securing stable employment.
4. Schedule follow-up visits to monitor progress, address any emerging concerns, and ensure that recommended services are being utilized effectively.
5. Advocate for additional support from local government agencies and nonprofit organizations to address the unique needs and challenges faced by youth aging out of the foster care system.

By addressing these areas, we aim to improve Ms. Kiviranta's living conditions, emotional well-being, and overall quality of life, ultimately helping her transition successfully into adulthood.
