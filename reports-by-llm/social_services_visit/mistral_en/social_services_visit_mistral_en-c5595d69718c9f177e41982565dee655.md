 Visit Report: Mental Health Monitoring Visit - 22.02.2025

Location: Janakkala, Finland
Visit Type: Mental Health Monitoring Visit
Household Composition: Child living with non-custodial relative (Anna Lehto, age 8)
Case Severity: Moderate

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct a mental health monitoring assessment for Anna Lehto, an eight-year-old child residing with her non-custodial relative. The visit aimed to evaluate the current state of Anna's mental health and living conditions, as well as assess family dynamics in light of the case's moderate severity.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, I was greeted by Anna who appeared shy but welcoming. Her living environment was clean and well-maintained, with a warm and inviting atmosphere. However, during our conversation, it became apparent that Anna exhibited signs of anxiety and low self-esteem. She shared concerns about school performance and social interactions, expressing feelings of isolation and loneliness.

Assessment:
Given the moderate case severity, it is evident that Anna's mental health requires attention and support. The observed symptoms suggest that she may be struggling with anxiety and self-esteem issues, which could potentially impact her overall wellbeing and academic performance. Furthermore, the absence of the custodial parent might contribute to feelings of instability and insecurity for Anna.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
To address these concerns, it is recommended that Anna be referred to a child psychologist specializing in anxiety disorders. Additionally, school counseling services should be engaged to provide support for both Anna and her teacher, as well as to facilitate improved social interactions among her peers. Regular follow-ups with the family will also be necessary to monitor progress and adjust interventions as needed.

In conclusion, this visit has highlighted the need for immediate mental health intervention for Anna Lehto. By implementing the recommended actions, we aim to support Anna in overcoming her challenges and fostering a more stable and secure environment for her growth and development.
