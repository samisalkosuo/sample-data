Visit Date: 01.01.2025
Location: Pöytyä, Finland
Visit Type: Social Reintegration Assessment

Client Name: Fatima Ahmed
Address: Mannerheimintie 32, Apt. 4, Pöytyä, Finland

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct a social reintegration assessment for the recently relocated immigrant family, specifically focusing on Ms. Fatima Ahmed and her family due to the high case severity. The aim was to evaluate their current living conditions, emotional state, and identify any notable concerns that may be hindering their successful integration into Finnish society.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival at the residence, it was observed that the living conditions were modest but clean. Ms. Ahmed appeared visibly stressed and anxious during our conversation. She expressed feelings of isolation due to language barriers and cultural differences, which have led to difficulties in finding employment and establishing a support network. The children, aged 7 and 9, seemed well-adjusted but were observed to be struggling academically due to their mother's preoccupation with managing daily life and navigating the new environment.

Assessment:
The high case severity is primarily attributed to the family's financial instability, emotional distress, and the children's academic struggles. The language barrier and cultural differences have created significant challenges for Ms. Ahmed in securing employment and building a support network. This situation has led to increased stress levels and a sense of isolation within the family.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Language Support: Enroll Ms. Ahmed in an intensive Finnish language course to improve her communication skills and increase her employability.
2. Employment Assistance: Provide job placement assistance and support with resume preparation and interview techniques.
3. Social Integration Program: Refer the family to a local social integration program that offers cultural orientation, networking opportunities, and community resources.
4. Academic Support: Connect the children with tutors or after-school programs to help them catch up on their studies.
5. Regular Follow-ups: Schedule regular visits to monitor progress, address any emerging issues, and provide ongoing support as needed.

It is crucial that we act promptly to address the challenges faced by this family in order to facilitate a successful social reintegration and improve their overall wellbeing.
