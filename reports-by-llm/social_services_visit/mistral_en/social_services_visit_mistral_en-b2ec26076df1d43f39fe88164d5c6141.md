 Title: Social Services Visit Report - Youth Mentoring Program Assessment

Visit Date: 12.12.2024
Location: Kirkkonummi, Finland
Visit Type: Youth Mentoring Program Assessment

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to assess the suitability and need for a youth mentoring program within the household of Ms. Sari Kiviranta, given her early dementia symptoms. The aim is to ensure that the young individuals in her care receive adequate support and guidance while maintaining a stable living environment.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, it was evident that Ms. Kiviranta's home was well-maintained, with a warm and inviting atmosphere. The 72-year-old woman appeared to be in good physical health but displayed signs of mild memory loss and confusion during our conversation. She expressed concern about her ability to care for her two grandchildren effectively as their legal guardian.

The children, aged 10 and 12, were friendly and well-behaved. They seemed to have a strong bond with their grandmother but appeared to lack structured guidance and supervision in areas such as homework and social skills development.

Assessment:
Given the low case severity, it is essential to provide additional support for Ms. Kiviranta and her grandchildren. The early stages of dementia may progress over time, potentially impacting her ability to care for the children adequately. Implementing a youth mentoring program could help address the identified gaps in guidance and supervision while providing emotional support for both the children and their grandmother.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Refer Ms. Kiviranta to a local memory clinic for further evaluation and potential treatment options.
2. Connect her with community resources, such as adult daycare services, to provide respite care and support during challenging periods.
3. Initiate a youth mentoring program tailored to the needs of her grandchildren, focusing on academic support, social skills development, and emotional well-being.
4. Schedule regular follow-up visits to monitor progress, adjust support services as needed, and ensure the continued safety and well-being of all parties involved.
