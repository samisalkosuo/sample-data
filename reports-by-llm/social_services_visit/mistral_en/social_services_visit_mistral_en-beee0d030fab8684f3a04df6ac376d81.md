Visit Date: 12.11.2024
Location: Riihimäki, Finland
Visit Type: Routine Family Wellbeing Visit
Household Composition: Mr. and Mrs. Särkijärvi (Retired)
Case Severity: Low

**Summary of Visit Purpose**

The purpose of this routine visit was to assess the wellbeing of the elderly couple, Mr. and Mrs. Särkijärvi, living independently in Riihimäki, Finland. The visit aimed to ensure their continued independence, identify any potential issues that may arise due to their advanced age, and provide necessary support or resources if required.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival, both Mr. and Mrs. Särkijärvi warmly welcomed the social worker into their home. The living conditions were clean and well-maintained, with essential amenities readily available. The couple appeared to be in good health, with no visible signs of distress or discomfort.

During the conversation, it was evident that Mr. Särkijärvi remained active and engaged, while Mrs. Särkijärvi showed some signs of mild memory loss, particularly when recalling recent events. However, they both expressed satisfaction with their current living situation and demonstrated a strong bond of mutual support.

**Assessment**

Given the low case severity, the overall assessment indicates that Mr. and Mrs. Särkijärvi are managing well in their independent living arrangement. While Mrs. Särkijärvi's memory loss is a concern, it does not currently pose an immediate risk to their wellbeing or safety.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

It is recommended that we continue routine visits to monitor the couple's health and living conditions. Additionally, referrals will be made for Mrs. Särkijärvi to undergo a comprehensive memory assessment by a neurologist. If necessary, further support services such as home care or memory-enhancing activities may be considered in the future.

In light of the couple's satisfaction with their current living situation, no immediate changes are suggested at this time. However, should any concerns arise during subsequent visits, appropriate adjustments will be made to ensure the continued wellbeing and safety of Mr. and Mrs. Särkijärvi.
