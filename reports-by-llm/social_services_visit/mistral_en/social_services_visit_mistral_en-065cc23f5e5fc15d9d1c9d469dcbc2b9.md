 Visit Report: Family Reunification Progress Check - 08.07.2025

Location: Sonkajärvi, Finland
Visit Type: Family Reunification Progress Check
Household Composition: Teenager with school attendance issues (Client: Eero Kivimäki, age 16)
Case Severity: Moderate

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to assess the progress of family reunification efforts and address the ongoing school attendance concerns for Eero Kivimäki. The visit aimed to evaluate the living conditions, emotional state, and family dynamics, as well as discuss potential solutions and next steps.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival at the residence located at Metsänkartano 2, Sonkajärvi, I was greeted by Eero's mother, Sanna Kivimäki. The living conditions were clean and well-maintained, with a welcoming atmosphere. Eero appeared to be in good health but exhibited signs of stress and anxiety. During our conversation, it became apparent that he has been struggling with school due to bullying and a lack of motivation.

Assessment:
The moderate case severity is primarily attributed to the ongoing school attendance issues and the emotional distress they have caused Eero. The family dynamics seem supportive, but there is a need for additional resources and interventions to address the root causes of Eero's struggles in school and improve his overall well-being.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Referral to a counselor specializing in adolescent mental health to help Eero cope with stress, anxiety, and bullying.
2. Collaboration with the local school to develop an individualized education plan that addresses Eero's specific needs and provides additional support as needed.
3. Exploration of extracurricular activities or clubs that may foster a sense of belonging and increase motivation for Eero.
4. Regular follow-up visits to monitor progress, adjust interventions as necessary, and provide ongoing emotional support for both Eero and his family.

In conclusion, the visit provided valuable insights into Eero's situation and highlighted the need for comprehensive support services to address his school attendance issues and emotional well-being. By implementing the recommended actions, we aim to improve Eero's quality of life and facilitate a successful family reunification.
