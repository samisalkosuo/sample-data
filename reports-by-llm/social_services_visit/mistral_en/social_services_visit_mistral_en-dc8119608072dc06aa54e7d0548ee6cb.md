Visit Purpose: The visit was conducted to review and update the support plan for Eero J채rvinen, a youth who is about to age out of the foster system. This meeting aimed to ensure that all necessary arrangements are in place to facilitate a smooth transition into independent living.

4. Regular Follow-ups: Schedule regular follow-up meetings to monitor progress, provide additional support, and adjust the support plan as needed.
5. Community Connections: Facilitate introductions to local community resources and organizations that can offer social support and opportunities for personal growth.

In conclusion, while Eero's living conditions are satisfactory, his employment status requires immediate attention to ensure a successful transition into independent life.
