 Visit Report: Immigration Case Monitoring Visit - 02.04.2025

Location: Seinäjoki, Finland
Visit Type: Immigration Case Monitoring Visit
Household Composition: Ms. Sari Kivimäki (35 years old) and her children - Elias (10), Anna (8), and Mikko (6)
Case Severity: Urgent

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The visit was conducted to assess the living conditions, emotional state, and overall well-being of Ms. Kivimäki and her children, as part of an urgent immigration case monitoring process. The purpose was to evaluate the family's progress since our last visit and determine if any additional support or resources are required.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, the apartment appeared clean and well-maintained. Ms. Kivimäki warmly welcomed the social worker and expressed her gratitude for the visit. The children were present during the conversation but seemed shy and reserved. Ms. Kivimäki shared that she has been struggling to find employment due to language barriers, which has put a strain on the family's financial situation. She appeared visibly stressed but remained composed throughout the discussion.

Assessment:
The family is currently facing significant challenges, primarily due to Ms. Kivimäki's inability to secure stable employment. This situation has led to financial hardship and increased stress levels within the household. The children seem to be coping well given the circumstances but may require additional support to ensure their emotional well-being.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Refer Ms. Kivimäki to language classes to improve her proficiency in Finnish, which will increase her chances of finding employment.
2. Provide financial assistance for the family on a temporary basis to alleviate some of the financial strain.
3. Arrange for a meeting with a child psychologist to assess the emotional well-being of the children and provide any necessary support.
4. Schedule a follow-up visit in two months to reassess the family's situation and determine if further assistance is required.
