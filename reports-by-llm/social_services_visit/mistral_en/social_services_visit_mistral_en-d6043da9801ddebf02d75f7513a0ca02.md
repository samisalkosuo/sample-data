 Visit Report

Visit Date: 15.10.2024
Location: Vesilahti, Finland
Visit Type: Routine Family Wellbeing Visit
Household Composition: Two-parent household (Mr. Juhani and Mrs. Sini Kivinen) with reported neglect case (Child A, 7 years old)
Case Severity: Moderate

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this routine family wellbeing visit was to assess the current state of the Kivinen family, particularly focusing on the reported neglect case of Child A. The visit aimed to evaluate the living conditions, family dynamics, and emotional states of all family members, as well as to discuss potential support services and next steps in addressing the moderate case severity.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, the Kivinen residence appeared clean but somewhat cluttered. Mr. Juhani and Mrs. Sini welcomed the social worker warmly, though both seemed visibly anxious during the initial conversation. Child A was present but initially hesitant to engage, appearing withdrawn and unkempt.

During the visit, it became apparent that the family was experiencing financial difficulties, which may have contributed to the reported neglect of Child A. The parents expressed concern about their ability to provide for their child's needs, citing job insecurity and mounting debts as primary stressors. Emotional tension was palpable between Mr. Juhani and Mrs. Sini, with both expressing frustration towards each other and the current situation.

Assessment:
The moderate case severity is largely due to the neglect of Child A, who appears to be struggling emotionally and physically as a result of inadequate care. The financial difficulties faced by the Kivinen family are likely exacerbating tensions within the household and contributing to the neglect. It is essential to address these issues promptly to ensure the wellbeing of all family members and prevent further escalation of the case.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Immediate referral for financial assistance, such as temporary unemployment benefits or emergency aid, to alleviate some of the financial burden on the Kivinen family.
2. Connection with local support services, including counseling for both parents and Child A, to address emotional stressors and improve communication within the household.
3. Regular follow-up visits to monitor progress and adjust support services as necessary.
4. Collaboration with school officials to ensure that Child A's educational needs are being met and any additional resources can be provided if needed.
5. Exploration of potential job training or employment opportunities for Mr. Juhani and Mrs. Sini to improve their long-term financial stability.
6. Continued engagement with the family to foster a supportive relationship and encourage open communication about challenges and successes.

It is crucial that the Kivinen family receives timely and comprehensive support to address the reported neglect case and improve overall family wellbeing. By implementing the recommended actions, we can help this family navigate through their current difficulties and work towards a more stable and secure future.
