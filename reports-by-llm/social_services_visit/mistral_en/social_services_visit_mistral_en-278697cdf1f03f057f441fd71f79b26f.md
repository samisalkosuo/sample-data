Case Severity: Urgent

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct a review of the support plan for Sari and Juhani Kivimäki, two adult siblings sharing housing in Akaa.

1. Immediate referral for mental health support for both Sari and Juhani to address their emotional distress and improve their overall well-being.
2. Emergency financial assistance to alleviate their current financial instability and ensure access to basic necessities such as food and medication.
3. Collaboration with local authorities to address the hoarding issue and improve the living conditions within the household.
4. Regular follow-up visits to monitor progress, assess the effectiveness of interventions, and adjust support measures as necessary.
5. Exploration of long-term housing solutions to provide a safer and more stable environment for Sari and Juhani.
