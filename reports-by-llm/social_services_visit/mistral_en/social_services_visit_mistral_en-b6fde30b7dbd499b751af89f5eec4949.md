 **Social Services Visit Report**

Visit Date: 30.01.2025
Location: Kuusamo, Finland
Visit Type: Family Reunification Progress Check

**Summary of Visit Purpose**

The purpose of this visit was to assess the progress of the family reunification process for client Eero Järvinen (16 years old), who has been in foster care since March 2024. The visit aimed to evaluate the living conditions, emotional state, and overall readiness of the family for a successful reintegration.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at the Järvinen residence, I was greeted warmly by Eero's parents, Anni and Juha. The home appeared clean and well-maintained, with a welcoming atmosphere. Eero seemed comfortable and engaged in conversation, displaying a positive emotional state throughout the visit.

During our discussion, it became clear that the family had made significant efforts to address the issues that led to Eero's placement in foster care. They spoke openly about their improved communication, increased understanding of Eero's needs, and active participation in counseling sessions.

However, concerns were raised regarding Eero's academic performance, which has been inconsistent since his return from foster care. Additionally, there was a noticeable lack of structure and supervision during Eero's free time, potentially contributing to the academic struggles.

**Assessment**

Given the moderate case severity, it is encouraging to see that the family has made progress in addressing the issues that led to Eero's placement in foster care. The positive emotional state of both Eero and his parents indicates a willingness to continue working towards a successful reunification.

However, the inconsistent academic performance and lack of structure during Eero's free time present risks that need to be addressed to ensure a smooth reintegration. It is essential to provide additional support to help Eero catch up academically and establish a more structured routine.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. Refer Eero for academic tutoring to help improve his performance and confidence in school.
2. Collaborate with the school to develop an individualized education plan that addresses Eero's specific needs and provides additional support as needed.
3. Arrange regular follow-up visits to monitor progress, address any concerns, and provide ongoing support to the family.
4. Encourage the family to maintain open communication with their social worker and continue participating in counseling sessions.
5. Consider involving a youth worker or mentor to provide additional guidance and structure for Eero during his free time.

In conclusion, while progress has been made in the family reunification process, there are still risks that need to be addressed to ensure a successful outcome. By implementing the recommended actions, we can continue supporting Eero and his family on their journey towards reunification.
