 Title: Social Reintegration Assessment Report

Visit Date: 07.07.2025
Location: Kitee, Finland
Visit Type: Social Reintegration Assessment

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to assess the progress and needs of the refugee family, currently residing in temporary accommodation in Kitee, Finland. The visit aimed to evaluate their social reintegration process, identify any challenges they may be facing, and provide recommendations for further support services.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, I was warmly greeted by the family consisting of Mr. Ali Ahmed (35) and his wife, Mrs. Fatima Hassan (32), along with their three children: Aisha (8), Omar (6), and Hana (4). The family's temporary accommodation appeared clean and well-maintained, with a welcoming atmosphere.

During the conversation, it was evident that Mr. Ahmed has been struggling to find employment due to language barriers and limited job opportunities in the area. Mrs. Hassan expressed concerns about their children's integration into the Finnish school system, as they are still adjusting to the new environment and language. The family's emotional state was generally stable but showed signs of stress related to their ongoing challenges.

Assessment:
The case severity is moderate due to the combined challenges of employment, language barriers, and children's integration issues. The family's resilience and adaptability are commendable, but they require additional support to overcome these obstacles and achieve successful social reintegration.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Employment Support: Refer Mr. Ahmed to a language training program and job placement service to help him secure employment that matches his skills and qualifications.
2. Education Support: Arrange for additional tutoring for the children to aid in their academic adjustment and improve their proficiency in Finnish.
3. Community Integration: Connect the family with local community organizations offering cultural events, language exchange programs, and social activities to facilitate their integration into Finnish society.
4. Regular Follow-ups: Schedule regular visits to monitor progress, address any emerging issues, and provide ongoing support as needed.

In conclusion, while the refugee family in Kitee is facing moderate challenges in their social reintegration process, they demonstrate a strong will to adapt and integrate into Finnish society. With the recommended actions and follow-ups, we aim to support them in overcoming these obstacles and achieving successful social reintegration.
