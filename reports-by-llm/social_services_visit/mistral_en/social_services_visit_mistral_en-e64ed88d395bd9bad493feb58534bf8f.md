Client: Mr. Juhani Kiviranta
Address: MÃ¤ntyharju 3, Pielavesi, Finland

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct a domestic violence risk assessment for the non-custodial relative, Mr. Juhani Kiviranta, in accordance with the reported moderate case severity and the presence of a child living within the household. The assessment aimed to evaluate potential risks, family dynamics, and determine appropriate follow-up actions or support services.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, Mr. Kiviranta greeted me warmly and allowed entry into his home. The living conditions were generally clean and well-maintained, with evidence of a child's presence. Throughout the visit, Mr. Kiviranta displayed a cooperative attitude and was open to discussing the concerns that led to this assessment. However, there were noticeable signs of emotional distress, including occasional agitation and a defensive demeanor when discussing sensitive topics related to his relationship history.

Assessment:
The moderate case severity is supported by the presence of a child living with Mr. Kiviranta and the observed emotional distress during our conversation. It appears that there may be a history of domestic violence, as suggested by Mr. Kiviranta's defensive behavior and signs of emotional turmoil. The family dynamics are complex, with potential power imbalances and communication issues that could contribute to an environment of tension or conflict.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
Given the moderate case severity and observed emotional distress, it is recommended that Mr. Kiviranta undergoes counseling sessions focused on addressing domestic violence, anger management, and improving communication skills. Additionally, a referral to a child psychologist would be beneficial to ensure the wellbeing of the child living in the household.

Further visits will be scheduled to monitor progress, assess the effectiveness of the recommended interventions, and provide ongoing support as needed. It is crucial that Mr. Kiviranta actively participates in these sessions and demonstrates a commitment to creating a safe and nurturing environment for all members of his household.

In conclusion, this visit provided valuable insights into the domestic violence risk within Mr. Juhani Kiviranta's household. The recommended actions aim to address the identified issues and promote a safer, healthier living situation for all involved.
