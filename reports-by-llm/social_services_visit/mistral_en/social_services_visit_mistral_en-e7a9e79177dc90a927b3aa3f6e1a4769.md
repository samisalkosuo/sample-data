Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct a safety plan monitoring check-in with Ms. Kivimäki, a young adult living alone, as part of our ongoing support services. The case context involves the implementation and maintenance of a safety plan due to previous domestic violence incidents.

Observations During the Visit:
During the visit, Elina appeared calm and composed. She welcomed the social worker warmly and willingly engaged in discussions about her well-being and progress since our last meeting. The living conditions were clean and orderly, with no signs of distress or disarray. Elina shared that she has been adhering to the safety plan and has not had any further incidents.

Assessment:
Given the low case severity, it is encouraging to see that Elina has been following the safety plan effectively. Her living conditions are stable, and there were no notable concerns during the visit. However, it is essential to continue monitoring her situation closely due to the history of domestic violence.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
In light of the assessment, we recommend that Elina continues to follow the safety plan as outlined. We will schedule a follow-up visit in two months to check on her progress and address any potential concerns. Additionally, we encourage Elina to continue participating in support groups for survivors of domestic violence to maintain a strong network of resources and allies.

In conclusion, Elina's adherence to the safety plan is commendable, and it is crucial to maintain regular contact to ensure her continued safety and well-being. We look forward to our next visit and will continue providing support as needed.
