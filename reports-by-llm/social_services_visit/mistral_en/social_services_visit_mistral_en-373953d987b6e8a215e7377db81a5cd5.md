 Visit Report

Visit Date: 08.11.2024
Location: Pello, Finland
Visit Type: Safety Plan Monitoring Visit

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to assess the progress and safety of the refugee family in temporary accommodation, as part of our ongoing safety plan monitoring. The family, comprising of Mr. Jari Kivinen (35) and his wife Sanna Kivinen (32), along with their three children, have been under our care since their arrival in Finland earlier this year.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, the Kivinen family welcomed us warmly into their temporary home. The living conditions were clean and well-maintained, with evidence of a structured daily routine for the children. Mr. and Mrs. Kivinen appeared calm and composed, expressing gratitude for the support they have received thus far.

During our conversation, both parents shared their experiences adapting to life in Finland, highlighting challenges related to language barriers and job search but also expressing optimism about their future prospects. The children, aged 7, 5, and 3, were playful and engaged, demonstrating a sense of security and happiness within their new environment.

Assessment:
Given the low case severity, the Kivinen family is progressing well in their integration process. The living conditions are satisfactory, and the family dynamics appear stable. However, it is essential to continue monitoring their situation due to the ongoing challenges they face with language barriers and employment.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
In light of our assessment, we recommend continuing our support services, including language tutoring for both parents and job placement assistance. We also suggest scheduling a follow-up visit in two months to reassess their progress and address any emerging concerns. Additionally, we will explore potential opportunities for permanent housing solutions.

It is crucial that the Kivinen family maintains this positive momentum as they continue to build a new life in Finland. With continued support and resources, we are confident that they will successfully integrate into their new community.
