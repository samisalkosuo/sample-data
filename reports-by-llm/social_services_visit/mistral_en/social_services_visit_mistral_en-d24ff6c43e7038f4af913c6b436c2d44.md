Client: Elina Kivimäki
Address: Mannerheimintie 5A, Apartment 3, Pirkkala, 31600, Finland

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was a follow-up on the school truancy report concerning Miss Elina Kivimäki. The initial report indicated critical case severity due to persistent absenteeism from school and potential negative impacts on her academic progress and future prospects.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, I was greeted by Miss Kivimäki who appeared somewhat withdrawn but cooperative. Her living conditions were modest, with a clean and well-maintained one-bedroom apartment. However, there were no signs of school materials or books present, suggesting that her educational resources might be lacking. During our conversation, she expressed feelings of apathy towards her education and admitted to struggling with motivation.

Assessment:
The critical case severity is justified given Miss Kivimäki's persistent truancy and the potential long-term consequences it may have on her academic success and future opportunities. Her emotional state suggests a need for additional support to address the underlying causes of her disengagement from school.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Referral to a counselor specializing in educational motivation and mental health issues to help Miss Kivimäki identify and overcome any obstacles preventing her from engaging with her education.
2. Collaboration with the local school to establish an individualized learning plan tailored to Miss Kivimäki's needs, interests, and learning style.
3. Provision of educational resources such as books, stationery, and a study desk to create a conducive learning environment at home.
4. Regular follow-up visits to monitor progress, offer encouragement, and adjust the support plan as necessary.
5. Exploration of vocational training or alternative education options if academic success proves challenging.

It is crucial that we act promptly to address Miss Kivimäki's school truancy issue, as her future prospects may be significantly impacted by her current educational trajectory. With the recommended actions in place, we can help Miss Kivimäki re-engage with her education and set herself on a path towards success.
