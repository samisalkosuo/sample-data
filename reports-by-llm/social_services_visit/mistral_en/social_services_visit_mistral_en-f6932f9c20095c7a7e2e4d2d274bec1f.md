Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to monitor the wellbeing and school attendance of Elias Kivimäki, a teenager who has been experiencing issues with regular school attendance. The visit type is classified as child visitation supervision, and the case severity is currently low.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival at the Kivimäki residence, I was greeted by Anna-Liisa Kivimäki, who welcomed me warmly. Elias was present in the living room, appearing slightly withdrawn but otherwise calm and cooperative during our conversation. The living conditions were clean and well-maintained, with a welcoming atmosphere.

During our discussion, it became apparent that Elias has been struggling to maintain consistent school attendance due to feelings of anxiety and low self-esteem. He expressed concerns about his academic performance and social interactions at school, which have led to him avoiding attending classes on several occasions.

Assessment:
The current situation presents a low level of case severity, as there are no immediate risks or indications of neglect or abuse. However, it is crucial to address Elias's school attendance issues and underlying emotional concerns to prevent potential escalation in the future. The family dynamics appear supportive, with Anna-Liisa expressing her concern for Elias's wellbeing and willingness to collaborate with social services to find solutions.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Referral to a school counselor or psychologist to address Elias's emotional concerns and provide strategies for managing anxiety and improving self-esteem.
2. Collaboration with the school to develop an individualized education plan that accommodates Elias's needs and provides additional support as necessary.
3. Regular follow-up visits to monitor progress, assess the effectiveness of interventions, and adjust strategies as needed.
4. Encourage open communication between Elias, Anna-Liisa, and school staff to foster a supportive network for Elias during this challenging time.
5. Explore opportunities for extracurricular activities or community programs that may help boost Elias's confidence and social skills.

In conclusion, while the current case severity is low, it is essential to address Elias's school attendance issues and emotional concerns proactively to ensure his long-term wellbeing and academic success. Collaborative efforts between social services, the Kivimäki family, and the school will be crucial in achieving these goals.
