 Title: Routine Family Wellbeing Visit Report - 01.11.2024

Location: Pello, Finland
Visit Type: Routine family wellbeing visit
Household Composition: Teenager in foster care (Client Name: Elias Lappalainen, Address: Kauppakatu 2A, Pello)
Case Severity: Moderate

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this routine family wellbeing visit was to assess the progress and overall well-being of Elias Lappalainen, a teenager currently in foster care. The visit aimed to evaluate the living conditions, emotional state, and any notable concerns that may impact his ongoing development and integration into the foster family.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, I was greeted warmly by both the foster parents and Elias. The living environment appeared clean, organized, and welcoming. Elias seemed comfortable and at ease during our conversation, displaying a positive attitude towards his current situation. However, it was evident that he still struggles with feelings of loneliness and missing his biological family.

Assessment:
Elias' case is currently classified as moderate due to the emotional challenges associated with being in foster care. While he has adapted well to his new living arrangements, the ongoing separation from his biological family continues to impact his emotional well-being. It is essential that we provide additional support services to help Elias cope with these feelings and facilitate a smoother integration into his foster family.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Referral to a licensed counselor specializing in adolescent psychology for ongoing therapy sessions to address Elias' emotional needs related to his current situation.
2. Organize regular meetings between Elias and his biological family, if possible, to maintain connections and provide emotional support.
3. Schedule follow-up visits every two months to monitor progress, adjust support services as needed, and ensure that Elias continues to thrive in his foster home.
4. Encourage the foster parents to participate in additional training programs focused on supporting teenagers in foster care, particularly those dealing with emotional challenges.
5. Collaborate with local schools to provide academic support for Elias, ensuring he remains engaged and motivated in his studies.

By implementing these recommendations, we can help Elias navigate the challenges of being in foster care while fostering a supportive environment that encourages his personal growth and well-being.
