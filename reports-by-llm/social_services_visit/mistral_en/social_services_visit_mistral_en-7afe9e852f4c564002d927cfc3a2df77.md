 Visit Report

Visit Date: 02.12.2024
Location: Kemijärvi, Finland
Visit Type: At-risk youth intervention visit

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to assess the wellbeing and living conditions of a multi-generational household identified as being at risk due to financial difficulties. The focus of the visit was on the adolescent member of the family, who has shown signs of potential distress and requires intervention to prevent further escalation of issues.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, I was greeted by the family residing at 2 Mannerheimintie, Kemijärvi. The household consisted of a grandmother (age 65), mother (age 38), and her adolescent son (age 14). The living conditions were modest but clean, with evidence of financial strain visible in the form of outdated appliances and sparse furnishings.

The adolescent displayed signs of emotional distress, appearing withdrawn and unengaged during our conversation. He expressed feelings of frustration and hopelessness regarding his current situation, particularly concerning his future prospects and the family's financial struggles. The mother acknowledged these concerns but seemed overwhelmed by her own responsibilities and lacked the resources to address them effectively.

Assessment:
The case severity is low, as there are no immediate threats to the safety or wellbeing of the individuals involved. However, the adolescent's emotional state requires attention to prevent further deterioration and potential escalation of issues. The family's financial difficulties contribute to the overall stress within the household and exacerbate the adolescent's feelings of hopelessness.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Referral to a local mental health service for the adolescent, to provide him with counseling and support to address his emotional distress.
2. Connection with a financial advisor or social worker to help the family explore potential avenues for alleviating their financial burdens, such as government assistance programs, budgeting advice, or employment resources.
3. Scheduled follow-up visit in 4 weeks to assess progress and adjust recommendations as necessary.

It is crucial that interventions are implemented promptly to ensure the adolescent's emotional wellbeing remains stable and that the family's financial situation improves. By addressing these issues, we can help create a more positive environment for all members of the household.
