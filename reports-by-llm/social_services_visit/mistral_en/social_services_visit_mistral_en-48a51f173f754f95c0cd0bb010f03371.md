 Title: Domestic Violence Risk Assessment Visit Report

Visit Date: 28.11.2024
Location: Hollola, Finland
Visit Type: Domestic Violence Risk Assessment

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The visit was conducted to assess the risk of domestic violence in a single-adult household with physical disability, given the urgent case severity. The purpose was to evaluate the living conditions, identify any potential risks, and provide appropriate support and referrals.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival at the residence located at Kauppakatu 2A, Hollola, we were greeted by Mr. Juhani Mäki, a 45-year-old gentleman with a visible mobility impairment. The living conditions appeared clean and well-maintained, but there were signs of recent distress, such as broken furniture and a noticeable absence of personal belongings.

Mr. Mäki was initially hesitant to engage in conversation, displaying signs of anxiety and fear. However, after some reassurance and explanation of our role, he opened up about his situation. He shared that he had been subjected to repeated emotional abuse by an ex-partner who still occasionally visited the house.

Assessment:
The living conditions, combined with Mr. Mäki's emotional state and disclosure of ongoing abuse, indicate a high risk of continued domestic violence. The presence of a physical disability further complicates the situation, as it may limit his ability to seek help or escape dangerous situations.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
Immediate action is required to ensure Mr. Mäki's safety. We will refer him to local social services for emergency housing and support. Additionally, we will connect him with a counselor specializing in domestic violence cases to provide emotional support and help devise a safety plan.

Given the ongoing nature of the abuse, regular follow-up visits will be scheduled to monitor the situation and ensure Mr. Mäki's wellbeing. We will also liaise with local law enforcement to increase patrols near his residence and provide additional protection if necessary.

In conclusion, this visit has highlighted the urgent need for intervention in Mr. Mäki's case. By providing appropriate support and ensuring regular follow-up, we aim to help him escape the cycle of domestic violence and rebuild a safe and secure life.
