Client Name: Kaarina Kivijärvi (78 years old)
Address: Mäkelänkatu 4, Urjala, FI-36900
Co-resident: Eero Kivijärvi (52 years old)

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct a follow-up on the elderly care services provided to Kaarina Kivijärvi, in light of the high case severity. The visit aimed to assess the living conditions, family dynamics, and emotional state of both Kaarina and her sibling Eero, who share housing.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, it was evident that the living conditions were suboptimal. The house appeared cluttered, with a noticeable lack of organization and cleanliness. Kaarina seemed to struggle with mobility issues, as she had difficulty navigating around the house. Eero, her sibling, appeared stressed and overwhelmed, expressing concerns about his sister's health and well-being.

During our conversation, Kaarina expressed feelings of loneliness and isolation, despite living with her brother. She mentioned a lack of social interaction and engagement in activities that she enjoys. Eero shared similar concerns, admitting to feeling overwhelmed by the responsibility of caring for his sister while managing his own life.

Assessment:
The high case severity is justified given the suboptimal living conditions, Kaarina's mobility issues, and the emotional strain on both siblings. The lack of social interaction and engagement for Kaarina, coupled with Eero's feelings of overwhelm, indicate a need for additional support services to improve their quality of life.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Home Care Services: To alleviate some of the burden on Eero, home care services should be arranged to assist with daily tasks such as cleaning, cooking, and personal care for Kaarina.
2. Social Activities: Organize social activities and outings for Kaarina to combat feelings of loneliness and isolation. This could include group activities, visits from volunteers, or arranging for hobbies and interests to be pursued within the community.
3. Respite Care: Provide respite care for Eero to allow him time to recharge and manage his own life more effectively. This could involve short-term stays at a care facility or arranging for temporary home care services.
4. Regular Follow-ups: Schedule regular follow-up visits to monitor the situation, assess progress, and make any necessary adjustments to the support services provided.

In conclusion, it is crucial that we address the suboptimal living conditions, Kaarina's mobility issues, and the emotional strain on both siblings to improve their quality of life. The recommended actions aim to provide additional support services, combat feelings of loneliness and isolation, and offer respite care for Eero. Regular follow-ups will ensure that these measures are effective and any necessary adjustments can be made.
