Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to review the support plan for Mr. Mäki, a parent with a substance use disorder, and assess the progress made since our last meeting. The visit aimed to evaluate the current living conditions, emotional state, and family dynamics, as well as identify any notable concerns or risks that may require immediate attention.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, it was evident that the living conditions in Mr. Mäki's home were substandard, with signs of neglect and disorganization.

Given the high case severity, it is clear that the current situation poses significant risks to both Mr. Mäki's well-being and that of his children. The substandard living conditions, combined with Mr. Mäki's substance use disorder and emotional instability, create an environment that is not conducive to the children's healthy development.

2. Temporary placement of the children with a trusted relative or foster care, ensuring their safety and well-being during this critical period.
3. Ongoing support services for Mr. Mäki upon his release from treatment, including regular counseling sessions, job training, and financial assistance to improve his living conditions.
4. Regular follow-up visits to monitor progress, assess the children's adjustment, and provide additional support as needed.
5. Collaboration with local schools and healthcare providers to ensure that the children receive the necessary resources and support during this challenging time.

It is crucial that swift action is taken to address the current situation and ensure the safety and well-being of Mr. Mäki and his children. The recommended actions aim to provide Mr. Mäki with the necessary support to overcome his substance use disorder, improve his living conditions, and ultimately create a stable and nurturing environment for his children.
