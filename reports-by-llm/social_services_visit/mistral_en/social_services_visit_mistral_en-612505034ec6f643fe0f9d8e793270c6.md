Date: 12.04.2025

Location: Mäntyharju, Finland (Address: Kauppakatu 23, Apt. 4, Mäntyharju)

Visit Type: Household Financial Hardship Review

Client Name: Elina and Juhani Särkijärvi

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The visit was conducted to assess the financial hardship faced by the cohabiting couple, Elina and Juhani Särkijärvi, due to their mental health challenges. Given the case severity as urgent, it was crucial to evaluate the situation and provide immediate support.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, both Elina and Juhani appeared visibly distressed. Their living conditions were sparse, with minimal furniture and basic necessities. The apartment seemed unkempt, indicating a lack of resources for regular upkeep. Both individuals displayed signs of anxiety and depression during our conversation. Notable concerns included their inability to secure stable employment due to their mental health issues, as well as the accumulation of unpaid bills and mounting debt.

Assessment:
The Särkijärvi family is currently experiencing a severe financial hardship due to their ongoing mental health challenges. Their situation is further complicated by their inability to secure stable employment, leading to an accumulation of debts and unpaid bills. The emotional state of both individuals suggests that they are struggling to cope with their circumstances, which poses a risk to their overall well-being.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
Immediate action is required to alleviate the financial burden on the Särkijärvi family. I recommend connecting them with local mental health services to address their ongoing mental health issues and provide them with the necessary support to manage their conditions more effectively. Additionally, I suggest reaching out to local employment agencies to assist Elina and Juhani in finding suitable employment opportunities that accommodate their needs.

In terms of financial assistance, I recommend applying for emergency financial aid to cover their immediate expenses, such as rent, utilities, and groceries. It is also crucial to explore long-term solutions, such as disability benefits or other forms of social support, to ensure their financial stability in the future.

I will follow up with the Särkijärvi family within two weeks to assess their progress and adjust our support services accordingly. Regular visits and check-ins will be necessary to monitor their situation and provide ongoing assistance as needed.
