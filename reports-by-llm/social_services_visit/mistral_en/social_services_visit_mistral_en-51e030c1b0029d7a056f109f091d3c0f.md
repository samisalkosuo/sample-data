Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct a social reintegration assessment for Ms. Sini Karvinen and her family, following her successful completion of a rehabilitation program.

During the conversation, it was noted that Ms. Karvinen had secured part-time employment at a local daycare center, which would provide her with a steady income and opportunities for further professional development.

In conclusion, while Ms. Sini Karvinen and her family are making significant strides towards reintegration, the high cost of housing in Mynämäki poses a potential risk to their long-term success. It is recommended that further assistance be provided to help alleviate this burden and ensure the family's continued progress.
