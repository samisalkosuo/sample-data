 **Social Services Visit Report**

Visit Date: 18.02.2025
Location: Sund, Finland (Address: Kauppakatu 3, Apt. 4, Sund 90123)
Visit Type: Domestic Violence Risk Assessment
Household Composition: Single Father (John Eriksson, age 38) with one child (Emma, age 7)
Case Severity: Moderate

**Summary of Visit Purpose**

The purpose of this visit was to conduct a risk assessment for potential domestic violence within the household of John Eriksson and his daughter Emma. The assessment was prompted by reports of escalating verbal conflicts and emotional distress within the family, which warranted an evaluation of the situation's severity and identification of any necessary interventions or support services.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival, I was greeted by John Eriksson at the door. He appeared visibly anxious but cooperative throughout the visit. The living conditions were generally clean and well-maintained, with a noticeable absence of any physical altercation evidence. Emma was present during the visit and seemed to be in good health, though she exhibited signs of emotional distress, such as frequent tears and clinging to her father.

During our conversation, John acknowledged that he had been under significant stress due to financial difficulties and the demands of single parenthood. He admitted to losing his temper on several occasions, but denied any physical violence towards Emma or himself. However, he expressed concern about his ability to manage his emotions effectively and sought guidance on coping strategies.

**Assessment**

The moderate case severity is primarily due to the emotional distress experienced by both John and Emma, as well as the potential for escalation if appropriate support is not provided. The financial struggles faced by the family may exacerbate tensions and contribute to increased stress levels. It is essential to address these underlying issues to ensure a safe and stable environment for Emma.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. Refer John to counseling services specializing in anger management and stress reduction techniques to help him better manage his emotions and improve communication within the household.
2. Connect John with local financial assistance programs to alleviate some of the financial burden and reduce stress levels.
3. Schedule follow-up visits to monitor progress, assess the effectiveness of interventions, and provide ongoing support as needed.
4. Offer Emma access to child psychotherapy services to address her emotional distress and promote healing and resilience.
5. Collaborate with local schools to ensure that Emma's academic performance and social interactions are being monitored closely for any signs of continued emotional distress or potential safety concerns.
6. Encourage John to maintain open communication with family, friends, or support networks to help mitigate feelings of isolation and reinforce positive coping mechanisms.
