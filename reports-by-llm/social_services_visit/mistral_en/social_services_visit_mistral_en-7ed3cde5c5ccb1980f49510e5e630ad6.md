 Title: Household Financial Hardship Review - Muurame, Finland (15.12.2024)

Client: Mr. Jari Kivinen
Address: Mäkelänkatu 23 A, 37600 Muurame, Finland

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct a household financial hardship review for the family of Mr. Jari Kivinen, given their history of chronic domestic violence and moderate case severity. The aim was to assess their current financial situation, living conditions, and identify potential support services that could alleviate their hardships while ensuring the safety and well-being of all family members.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, it was evident that the living conditions were substandard, with signs of neglect and disrepair. Mr. Kivinen appeared visibly stressed and anxious during our conversation. His wife, Mrs. Sanna Kivinen, was noticeably withdrawn and seemed to avoid direct eye contact. The couple's two children, aged 8 and 10, were left unsupervised and appeared distressed.

During the discussion, it became clear that Mr. Kivinen had lost his job due to ongoing health issues, leading to a significant decrease in household income. This financial strain, coupled with the history of domestic violence, has created an environment of tension and instability within the family.

Assessment:
The current situation presents a moderate risk to the well-being of all family members. The financial hardship, combined with the chronic domestic violence, creates a volatile environment that requires immediate intervention. It is crucial to provide support services to address both the financial difficulties and the ongoing safety concerns.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Immediate referral to local social services for emergency financial assistance to help alleviate the current hardship.
2. Referral to a domestic violence counseling service for Mr. Kivinen, with a focus on anger management and conflict resolution skills.
3. Arrangement for temporary housing in a safe environment to ensure the safety of all family members.
4. Follow-up visit within two weeks to assess the impact of the recommended actions and determine further support needs.
5. Ongoing monitoring of the situation, with regular visits to ensure the well-being of the family and address any emerging issues.

It is essential that all parties involved work collaboratively to provide the necessary support and resources for Mr. Jari Kivinen's family. The immediate focus should be on ensuring their safety and addressing the financial hardship, with a long-term goal of providing counseling and resources to help break the cycle of domestic violence.
