Visit Date: 09.09.2024
Location: Posio, Finland
Visit Type: Follow-up on school truancy report

Client Information:
Name: Sirkka Kivimäki
Address: Mäntylahdenkatu 12, Apt. 3, Posio, 97600

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to follow up on a report regarding school truancy involving Sirkka Kivimäki's grandchild. Given the client's elderly status and early dementia symptoms, the visit also aimed to assess her ability to provide adequate care and support for the child.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, I was greeted by Sirkka who appeared friendly but slightly disoriented. The living conditions were clean and well-maintained, with a noticeable absence of the grandchild's belongings. Sirkka expressed concern about the child's school performance and admitted to having difficulty managing both her own health issues and the child's needs.

Assessment:
The case severity is currently low due to the clean living conditions and Sirkka's apparent willingness to seek help. However, the ongoing truancy issue and Sirkka's early dementia symptoms pose potential risks for the child's well-being and educational progress. The family dynamics seem strained, with Sirkka struggling to balance her own health concerns and caregiving responsibilities.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Refer Sirkka to local dementia support groups and healthcare providers for further assessment and management of her condition.
2. Connect Sirkka with a social worker specializing in family dynamics to help address the challenges she faces in caring for her grandchild.
3. Arrange for home visits from a childcare professional to assess the child's needs and provide temporary support, if necessary.
4. Schedule regular follow-up visits to monitor Sirkka's progress and ensure the child's continued well-being.
5. Collaborate with the school to develop an individualized education plan for the child, addressing any academic or behavioral concerns.
6. Encourage open communication between Sirkka, the child, and school officials to foster a supportive environment for the child's success.
