 Title: Social Services Visit Report - Kaavi, Finland (29.03.2025)

Client: Sirkka Järvinen
Address: Mäntylahdenkatu 12, Kaavi, Finland
Case ID: FIN-JUV-2025-004
Case Severity: Moderate
Visit Type: Juvenile Probation Compliance Visit

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to assess the living conditions and compliance with probation terms for a juvenile residing in the household of Sirkka Järvinen, who has been diagnosed with early dementia symptoms. The visit aimed to ensure the safety, well-being, and appropriate care of both Sirkka and the juvenile.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, it was evident that the living conditions were generally clean and well-maintained. However, there were signs of neglect in certain areas, such as an accumulation of unopened mail and expired food items in the kitchen. Sirkka appeared disoriented at times during our conversation but was otherwise cooperative and friendly. The juvenile, who was not present during the initial part of the visit, demonstrated a mature demeanor when they joined us later.

Assessment:
The moderate case severity is primarily due to Sirkka's early dementia symptoms, which may compromise her ability to provide adequate care for herself and the juvenile. The observed signs of neglect suggest that she may require additional support services to maintain a safe and healthy living environment. The juvenile appears to be coping well with the situation but could benefit from continued monitoring and guidance.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Refer Sirkka for an assessment by a geriatric care manager to determine her need for additional support services, such as home health aides or adult daycare.
2. Schedule regular follow-up visits to monitor the living conditions and ensure compliance with probation terms for the juvenile.
3. Provide resources and guidance to help Sirkka manage her household more effectively, including organizing her mail, managing finances, and meal planning.
4. Offer counseling services for both Sirkka and the juvenile to address any emotional or psychological concerns that may arise due to Sirkka's dementia diagnosis and the probation situation.
5. Collaborate with local schools to ensure the juvenile receives academic support if needed, as well as resources for coping with their caregiver's health condition.

In conclusion, while the living conditions were generally acceptable, there are concerns regarding Sirkka's ability to provide adequate care due to her early dementia symptoms. Recommended actions include referrals for additional support services and regular follow-up visits to monitor the situation and ensure the safety and well-being of both Sirkka and the juvenile.
