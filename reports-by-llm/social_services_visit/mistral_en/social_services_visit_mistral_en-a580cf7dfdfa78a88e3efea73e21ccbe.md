Visit Type: Routine family wellbeing visit
Case Severity: Moderate

Client Information:
Name: Elina Kivimäki
Address: Metsänkartano 3, 48600 Joutsa

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this routine visit was to assess the wellbeing of young adult Elina Kivimäki living alone in Joutsa, Finland. The visit was conducted due to a moderate case severity, indicating potential challenges that may require additional support or resources.

Observations During the Visit:
During the visit, Elina appeared to be in good physical health and maintained a positive demeanor throughout our conversation. Her living conditions were clean and well-maintained, with essential amenities present. However, it was noted that she seemed somewhat isolated, with limited social interactions outside of work. Emotionally, Elina expressed feelings of loneliness and a desire for more meaningful connections in her life.

Assessment:
The moderate case severity is primarily due to Elina's reported feelings of isolation and loneliness. While her living conditions are satisfactory, it is essential to address her emotional state to prevent potential mental health concerns from arising. The lack of social interactions outside of work may be contributing to these feelings and could benefit from intervention.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
To support Elina in addressing her feelings of isolation, we recommend the following actions:
1. Referral to a local community center for social activities and opportunities to meet new people.
2. Encourage participation in interest groups or clubs that align with her hobbies or passions.
3. Provide resources for mental health support if needed, such as counseling services or support groups.
4. Schedule follow-up visits to monitor progress and adjust recommendations as necessary.

By addressing Elina's emotional needs and fostering social connections, we aim to improve her overall wellbeing and reduce the case severity.
