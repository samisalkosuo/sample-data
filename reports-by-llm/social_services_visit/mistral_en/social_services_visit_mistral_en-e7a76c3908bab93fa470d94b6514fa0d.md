Summary of Visit Purpose:
The visit was conducted to assess the living conditions and emotional state of Mr. Eero Kiviranta, a single adult with intellectual disability, who is currently classified as critically vulnerable. The purpose was to evaluate his current situation, identify any risks or concerns, and provide necessary support services.

Observations During the Visit:
