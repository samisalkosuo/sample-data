 Visit Report: Family Reunification Progress Check - Kruunupyy, Finland (27.01.2025)

Client Information:
Name: Eero J채rvinen
Address: Mannerheimintie 3A, Kruunupyy, 96400

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct a progress check on the family reunification process for Eero J채rvinen, a teenager with school attendance issues. Given the high case severity, it is crucial to ensure that necessary interventions are implemented promptly to address the challenges faced by the family and improve the overall situation.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival at the residence, I was greeted by Eero's mother, Sari J채rvinen. The living conditions were generally clean and well-maintained, but there were signs of stress and tension within the household. Eero appeared to be withdrawn and evasive during our conversation, displaying a lack of enthusiasm for school and expressing feelings of isolation.

Assessment:
The high case severity is indicative of significant challenges faced by both Eero and his family. Eero's school attendance issues, coupled with his emotional state, suggest that he may be struggling to cope with the pressures of adolescence and the transition to adulthood. The tension within the household could be a result of these struggles and the resulting stress on the family as a whole.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Referral to a school counselor for Eero to address his school attendance issues, explore potential learning difficulties, and provide emotional support.
2. Engage with local mental health services to assess Eero's emotional wellbeing and provide appropriate therapy or counseling if necessary.
3. Offer family counseling sessions to help improve communication within the household and reduce stress levels.
4. Schedule regular follow-up visits to monitor progress, adjust interventions as needed, and ensure that the family has access to ongoing support services.
5. Collaborate with local educational authorities to develop an individualized education plan for Eero, focusing on his unique needs and strengths.
6. Encourage Sari J채rvinen to seek support for herself through a local support group or counseling service to help her cope with the stress of the situation and better support Eero.

By addressing these issues and providing appropriate interventions, it is hoped that we can improve Eero's school attendance, emotional wellbeing, and overall quality of life while also reducing the stress on his family. Regular follow-up visits will be essential to ensure that progress is being made and adjustments can be made as needed.
