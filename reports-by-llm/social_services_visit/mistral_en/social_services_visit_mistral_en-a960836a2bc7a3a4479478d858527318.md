Client: Sari Kiviranta (69 years old)
Address: Mäkelänkatu 12, Rautavaara, Finland

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The visit was conducted as a follow-up on the elderly care case of Sari Kiviranta, in response to escalating concerns regarding her grandson's school attendance issues and the overall household situation. The high case severity necessitated an urgent assessment and intervention to ensure the wellbeing of both Sari and her grandson.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, it was evident that the living conditions in the household were suboptimal, with signs of neglect and disorganization. Sari appeared visibly stressed and fatigued, expressing concerns about her grandson's erratic school attendance and his increasingly aggressive behavior at home. The grandson, who was present during the visit, displayed a lack of interest in engaging in conversation and exhibited signs of emotional distress.

Assessment:
The current situation presents a high risk to both Sari and her grandson due to the escalating school attendance issues, the suboptimal living conditions, and the grandson's increasingly aggressive behavior. The household dynamics suggest that Sari may be struggling to cope with her caregiving responsibilities, which could potentially lead to further deterioration in their living conditions and the grandson's emotional state.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Immediate referral of Sari and her grandson to a local social worker for comprehensive assessment and support services, including counseling, financial assistance, and home care services.
2. Collaboration with the school to address the grandson's attendance issues and implement a support plan to help him cope with any underlying emotional or behavioral challenges.
3. Regular follow-up visits to monitor the progress of the interventions and adjust them as necessary to ensure the wellbeing of Sari and her grandson.
4. Exploration of potential long-term care solutions, such as residential care facilities or foster care, if the current situation does not improve significantly.

It is crucial that prompt action is taken to address the high case severity and ensure the safety and wellbeing of both Sari and her grandson. The recommended actions aim to provide immediate support while also addressing the underlying issues that have contributed to this critical situation.
