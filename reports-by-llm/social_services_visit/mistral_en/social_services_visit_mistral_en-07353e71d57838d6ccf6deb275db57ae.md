 Title: Household Financial Hardship Review Visit Report - 21.09.2024

Location: Lieksa, Finland

Client: The J채rvinen Family - Address: Kauppakatu 35, Apt. 2, Lieksa, 86700

Visit Purpose:
The visit was conducted to review the financial hardship case of the J채rvinen family, a two-parent household with a reported neglect case. The purpose of this review was to assess the current state of their financial situation and determine if additional support services are required to alleviate their difficulties.

Observations During the Visit:
During the visit, both parents were present and cooperative. The living conditions were modest but clean, with evidence of a recent effort to declutter and organize the space. The emotional state of both parents appeared stressed but resilient. There were no notable concerns regarding their ability to provide basic necessities for themselves and their child. However, it was observed that the reported neglect case may be related to a lack of resources or knowledge rather than intentional negligence.

Assessment:
The case severity is currently low due to the family's resilience and cooperative attitude. The financial hardship appears to be the primary issue, with the reported neglect case likely stemming from this. The family dynamics appear stable, but further monitoring is necessary to ensure the ongoing well-being of the child.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
It is recommended that the J채rvinen family be referred to a financial counseling service to help manage their current financial difficulties and plan for future financial stability. Additionally, continued monitoring of the reported neglect case is necessary to ensure the child's well-being. A follow-up visit will be scheduled in two months to assess the progress made and adjust support services as needed.

In conclusion, while the J채rvinen family is currently managing their situation with resilience, additional support is required to alleviate their financial hardship and address the reported neglect case. With the recommended actions in place, it is hoped that the family will be able to overcome these challenges and achieve long-term stability.
