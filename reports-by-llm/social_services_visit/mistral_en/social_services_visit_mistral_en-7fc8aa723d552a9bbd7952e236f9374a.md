 Title: Social Services Visit Report - Youth Mentoring Program Assessment

Visit Date: 24.12.2024
Location: Eurajoki, Finland
Visit Type: Youth Mentoring Program Assessment

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to assess the suitability and effectiveness of the youth mentoring program for a single adult residing in Eurajoki with a physical disability. The case severity is moderate, indicating a need for targeted support services to ensure the individual's well-being and independence.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival at the residence located at Kauppakatu 21, 28600 Eurajoki, we were greeted by Mr. Juhani Lehto, a friendly and cooperative individual who welcomed us warmly. The living conditions were clean and well-maintained, with necessary adaptations for his physical disability.

Mr. Lehto expressed concerns about his ability to provide adequate guidance and support to his 16-year-old nephew, who has recently moved in due to family issues. Mr. Lehto's physical condition limits his mobility and energy levels, making it challenging for him to engage with the youth effectively.

Assessment:
The moderate case severity is primarily driven by the combined challenges faced by Mr. Lehto â€“ his physical disability and the need to care for a troubled adolescent. The living conditions are manageable, but the emotional strain on Mr. Lehto is evident. The youth's presence has added complexity to an already challenging situation.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Referral to a local support group specializing in youth mentoring and guidance for at-risk adolescents. This service would provide additional resources and expertise to help manage the youth's behavioral issues, alleviating some of the burden on Mr. Lehto.
2. Exploration of adaptive equipment or home modifications that could improve Mr. Lehto's mobility and independence within his residence.
3. Regular follow-up visits to monitor progress, adjust support services as needed, and offer emotional support to both Mr. Lehto and the youth.
4. Collaboration with local schools to ensure the youth is receiving appropriate educational support and resources.

By addressing these areas, we aim to improve the living situation for both Mr. Lehto and his nephew, ensuring their well-being and promoting a stable, supportive environment.
