 Visit Report: Youth Mentoring Program Assessment - 04.06.2025

Location: Pöytyä, Finland
Visit Type: Youth Mentoring Program Assessment
Household Composition: Blended family with recent custody changes (Client Name: Anna Lehto, Address: Kauppakatu 12, Pöytyä)
Case Severity: Moderate

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to assess the current situation and living conditions of the client's household following recent custody changes. The focus was on evaluating the family dynamics and identifying any potential risks or concerns that may require intervention through the youth mentoring program.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, it was evident that the household consisted of Anna Lehto, her partner, and their two children - a 12-year-old son from Anna's previous relationship (Child A) and a 7-year-old daughter from the current relationship (Child B). The living conditions were clean and well-maintained, with a welcoming atmosphere.

Interactions between family members appeared to be cordial, but there were noticeable tensions between Child A and his stepfather. Child A displayed signs of resentment towards the new family structure, which was evident in his behavior and emotional state. Conversely, Child B seemed to adapt well to the changes and interacted positively with both parents.

Assessment:
Given the moderate case severity and recent custody changes, it is essential to address the tensions between Anna's son (Child A) and her partner. The emotional distress displayed by Child A may lead to further complications if not addressed promptly. It is crucial to provide support for both children, ensuring their well-being and promoting a harmonious family environment.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Refer the family to the youth mentoring program for counseling sessions aimed at addressing the emotional distress of Child A and improving family dynamics.
2. Schedule regular follow-up visits to monitor progress and adjust support services as necessary.
3. Consider additional resources, such as individual therapy for Child A or parenting workshops for Anna's partner, if needed.
4. Encourage open communication within the family and emphasize the importance of understanding and empathy towards each other's feelings during this transition period.

By addressing these concerns promptly and providing appropriate support services, it is hoped that the family will be able to navigate through this challenging time and establish a more stable and harmonious household.
