 **Social Services Visit Report**

**Visit Date:** 10.02.2025

**Location:** Hämeenkyrö, Finland

**Visit Type:** Domestic Relocation Follow-up

**Household Composition:** The Al-Amin family (consisting of Mr. Ahmed Al-Amin, 38, Mrs. Fatima Al-Amin, 35, and their three children: Ali, 10, Amina, 8, and Amir, 6) are currently residing in temporary accommodation.

**Case Severity:** Moderate

**Summary of Visit Purpose:** The purpose of this visit was to follow up on the Al-Amin family's recent relocation and assess their adaptation to their new living environment, as well as identify any potential challenges or support needs that may require intervention.

**Observations During the Visit:** Upon arrival, the Al-Amin family warmly welcomed our social worker. The apartment appeared clean and orderly, with evidence of the children's toys scattered throughout. Mr. Al-Amin seemed anxious but cooperative during the conversation, while Mrs. Al-Amin displayed a more reserved demeanor.

The family shared their concerns about settling into their new community, particularly regarding language barriers and finding employment opportunities for both parents. The children appeared well-adjusted, though Amina expressed some difficulty adapting to her new school due to cultural differences.

**Assessment:** Given the moderate case severity, it is evident that the Al-Amin family is experiencing some challenges in their integration process. The language barrier and employment concerns are significant stressors for the family, which may impact their overall wellbeing and ability to establish a stable foundation in their new home.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up:** It is recommended that the Al-Amin family be referred to language classes and job placement services to address their employment needs. Additionally, we will connect them with cultural liaisons who can provide support and guidance during their transition.

Furthermore, we will schedule regular follow-up visits to monitor the family's progress and adjust our interventions as necessary. It is crucial that we continue to offer emotional support and resources to help alleviate any stressors and ensure a successful integration for the Al-Amin family.
