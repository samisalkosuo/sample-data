Visit Date: 22.06.2025
Location: Pyhäjoki, Finland (Address: Kauppakatu 12, Apt. 3, Pyhäjoki)
Visit Type: Newborn and Infant Safety Visit
Household Composition: Adult living with severe mental health condition (Client: Ms. Sari Laakso)
Case Severity: Critical

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to assess the safety and well-being of a newborn infant in the household, given the presence of an adult with a severe mental health condition. The visit aimed to identify any potential risks or concerns that may impact the infant's welfare and to provide recommendations for necessary support services.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, Ms. Laakso appeared distressed and disorganized. The living conditions were substandard, with clutter and signs of neglect throughout the apartment. The infant was found unattended in a soiled diaper, indicating a lack of consistent care. Ms. Laakso's emotional state seemed erratic, and she displayed difficulty maintaining focus during the conversation.

Assessment:
The critical case severity is justified given the substandard living conditions, the adult's mental health condition, and the observed neglect of the infant. The risk of further harm to the infant is high without immediate intervention and support. Ms. Laakso's emotional state and ability to care for herself and the infant are concerning, suggesting a need for professional assistance.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Immediate referral to mental health services for an evaluation and treatment plan for Ms. Laakso.
2. Temporary removal of the infant from the household and placement in foster care until Ms. Laakso's condition stabilizes and living conditions improve.
3. Home visit follow-ups to monitor progress and ensure continued improvement in living conditions and Ms. Laakso's mental health.
4. Referral to parenting support services for Ms. Laakso once she is stable enough to care for the infant safely.
5. Collaboration with local social services, healthcare providers, and law enforcement agencies as needed to ensure the best interests of the infant are protected.

It is crucial that these recommended actions be implemented promptly due to the critical case severity and the immediate need to protect the infant's welfare. Regular follow-ups will be necessary to ensure ongoing support for both Ms. Laakso and the infant.
