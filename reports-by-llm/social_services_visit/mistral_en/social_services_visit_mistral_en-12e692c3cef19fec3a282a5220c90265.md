Visit Type: Substance Abuse Support Visit

Client Information:
Name: Anni Mäki (Address redacted for privacy)
Household Composition: Family of five in a subsidized apartment
Case Severity: Low

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to provide ongoing support and monitoring for Ms. Mäki's substance abuse recovery, as part of our commitment to helping her maintain a drug-free lifestyle and improve the overall wellbeing of her family.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, I was warmly greeted by Ms. Mäki and her family. The living conditions in their subsidized apartment were clean and well-maintained, with evidence of ongoing efforts to create a nurturing environment for all members. Ms. Mäki appeared calm, focused, and engaged during our conversation, demonstrating a strong commitment to her recovery.

During the visit, we discussed various aspects of her progress, including her participation in support groups, adherence to medication regimens, and strategies for managing stress and triggers. Ms. Mäki openly shared her experiences and challenges, expressing gratitude for the ongoing support provided by our services.

Assessment:
Given the low case severity, it is evident that Ms. Mäki has made significant strides in her recovery journey. Her active engagement with support groups, adherence to treatment plans, and positive demeanor suggest a strong foundation for long-term success. However, it is essential to remain vigilant and continue monitoring her progress, as substance abuse recovery can be an ongoing process that requires consistent effort and support.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
In light of Ms. Mäki's progress, I recommend continuing our regular visits to provide ongoing support and encouragement. Additionally, I suggest maintaining open lines of communication with her support group leaders to ensure a coordinated approach to her recovery. It would also be beneficial for Ms. Mäki to explore additional resources, such as counseling or vocational training, to further enhance her wellbeing and independence.

I will schedule our next visit for December 14th, 2024, to continue monitoring Ms. Mäki's progress and address any emerging concerns. In the meantime, I encourage Ms. Mäki to maintain her commitment to recovery and seek assistance if she encounters any challenges or setbacks.
