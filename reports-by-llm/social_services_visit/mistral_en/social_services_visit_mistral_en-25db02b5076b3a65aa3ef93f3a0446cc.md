Location: Loviisa, Finland

Client Name: Elina Kivimäki (38 years old) & Juhani Mäkelä (42 years old)
Address: Mannerheimintie 12, Apt. 3, Loviisa, 04600

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct an immigration case monitoring check on the cohabiting couple, Elina Kivimäki and Juhani Mäkelä, who have been under our service due to their mental health challenges. The visit aimed to assess their current living conditions, emotional state, and compliance with the agreed support plan.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, both clients welcomed us warmly and showed a willingness to cooperate throughout the visit. Their apartment was clean and well-maintained, indicating that they have been adhering to their hygiene and living conditions agreement.

During our conversation, it became apparent that both Elina and Juhani are managing their mental health issues more effectively than during our previous visits. They reported fewer instances of anxiety and depression, and they seemed more engaged in their daily activities and social interactions.

However, there were some concerns regarding their medication management. While they have been taking their prescribed medications regularly, they expressed difficulty in affording the costly treatments without financial assistance.

Assessment:
Given the low case severity, it is encouraging to see that both clients are making progress in managing their mental health challenges. Their improved emotional state and living conditions indicate a positive response to the support services provided. However, the financial burden of their medication remains a significant concern that could potentially impact their recovery process.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. We will refer Elina and Juhani to our financial assistance program to help alleviate the cost of their medications.
2. Continue regular monitoring visits to assess their progress and address any emerging concerns.
3. Collaborate with their mental health care providers to ensure that they receive appropriate support and adjustments to their treatment plans if necessary.
4. Encourage them to participate in social activities and community programs to foster a sense of belonging and improve their overall well-being.

In conclusion, the visit demonstrated that Elina Kivimäki and Juhani Mäkelä are making strides in managing their mental health challenges. With continued support and financial assistance, we hope to see further improvements in their living conditions and emotional state.
