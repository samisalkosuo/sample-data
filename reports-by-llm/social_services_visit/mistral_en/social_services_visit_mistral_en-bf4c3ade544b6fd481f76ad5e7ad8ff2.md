Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct a risk assessment for domestic violence within the household of Ms. Kaarina Järvinen and her spouse, due to the reported high case severity. The visit aimed to evaluate the current living conditions, family dynamics, and emotional states of both individuals, as well as identify any potential risks or concerns that may require immediate intervention.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, it was noted that the living conditions were generally clean and well-maintained, but there were signs of tension between Ms. Järvinen and her spouse during our interaction. Ms. Järvinen appeared visibly distressed and hesitant to discuss certain topics, while her spouse displayed a defensive and aggressive demeanor throughout the conversation.

Notable concerns included repeated instances of verbal abuse, emotional manipulation, and financial control exhibited by Mr. Järvinen towards Ms. Järvinen. Additionally, there were indications that Ms. Järvinen had been isolated from friends and family, which further compounded her distress.

Assessment:
Given the high case severity and observed behaviors during the visit, it is evident that there is a significant risk of continued domestic violence within the household. The emotional state of both individuals suggests that this situation has been ongoing for an extended period, and without intervention, the situation may escalate further.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
Immediate action is required to ensure the safety and wellbeing of Ms. Järvinen. It is recommended that a referral be made to the local domestic violence support services for counseling, advocacy, and potential relocation assistance. Additionally, a follow-up visit should be scheduled within one week to assess the effectiveness of the interventions and determine if further action is necessary.

In light of the observed emotional distress and isolation experienced by Ms. Järvinen, it is crucial that she is provided with ongoing support and resources to help her navigate this challenging situation. It is also essential that Mr. Järvinen receives appropriate counseling to address his aggressive behaviors and learn healthier ways to communicate and resolve conflicts within the relationship.

In conclusion, the risk assessment visit has identified a high severity case of domestic violence within the household of Ms. Kaarina Järvinen and her spouse. Immediate action is required to ensure the safety and wellbeing of Ms. Järvinen, and ongoing support should be provided to both individuals to address the underlying issues and promote a healthier, more harmonious relationship moving forward.
