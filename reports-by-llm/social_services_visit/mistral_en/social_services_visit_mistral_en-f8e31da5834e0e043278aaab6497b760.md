 Visit Report: Support Plan Review Meeting - 09.10.2024

Location: Valkeakoski, Finland

Client: The Mohammed Family (Ali and Fatima Mohammed)
Address: Kauppiankatu 23, Apt. 5, Valkeakoski, 37600

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct a support plan review meeting for the recently relocated immigrant family, the Mohammeds, in light of their moderate case severity. The aim was to assess their progress since the initial support plan was established and discuss any adjustments or additional resources required to ensure their successful integration into Finnish society.

Observations During the Visit:
The visit took place at the Mohammed family's apartment, where they warmly welcomed the social worker. The living conditions were generally clean and well-maintained, with evidence of efforts being made to create a comfortable home environment for their two young children. Ali and Fatima appeared calm and open during the conversation, expressing concerns about finding stable employment and navigating the Finnish education system for their children. Both parents demonstrated a strong commitment to learning Finnish and adapting to local customs, but expressed feelings of isolation due to limited social connections.

Assessment:
The Mohammed family's moderate case severity stems from their recent relocation, language barriers, and challenges in securing employment and establishing social networks. While they have made progress in settling into their new home and adapting to Finnish culture, the family still faces significant obstacles that could potentially impact their long-term integration and wellbeing.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Employment Support: Referral to a local employment agency specializing in assisting immigrants with job placement and career development.
2. Language Training: Enrollment in an intensive Finnish language course for both parents, focusing on practical communication skills and cultural understanding.
3. Social Integration: Connection with a local community organization offering activities and events designed to help newcomers build friendships and expand their social networks.
4. Regular Follow-ups: Scheduled bi-monthly meetings to monitor progress, address any emerging concerns, and adjust the support plan as needed.
5. School Support: Liaison with the children's school to ensure they are receiving appropriate academic and emotional support during this transition period.

In conclusion, the Mohammed family is making a concerted effort to integrate into Finnish society, but faces challenges that require ongoing support and resources. The recommended actions aim to address their employment, language, social integration, and educational needs, with regular follow-ups to ensure their continued progress and wellbeing.
