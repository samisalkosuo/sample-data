Client Information:
Name: Kaarina & Juhani Lappalainen

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct a disability support assessment for the elderly couple, Kaarina and Juhani Lappalainen, living independently in Muurame. The assessment aimed to identify any potential challenges they may face due to aging and to recommend appropriate support services to ensure their continued independent living.

Observations During the Visit:
During the visit, both Kaarina and Juhani appeared to be in good health and spirits. Their home was clean and well-maintained, with necessary safety measures such as non-slip mats and handrails installed. The couple demonstrated a strong sense of independence, managing their daily activities without significant difficulty. However, it was noted that Kaarina experiences occasional mobility issues due to arthritis in her knees, which may require additional support in the future.

Assessment:
Given the low case severity, the Lappalainens are currently managing well and do not require immediate intervention. However, it is essential to address Kaarina's mobility concerns proactively to prevent potential complications in the future. The couple's emotional state was positive, with a clear desire to remain independent for as long as possible.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Referral to a physical therapist for an assessment and recommendations on managing Kaarina's arthritis symptoms and improving her mobility.
2. Provide information about local community resources, such as transportation services and meal delivery programs, to help alleviate any potential burdens associated with daily activities.
3. Schedule a follow-up visit in three months to reassess Kaarina's mobility and adjust recommendations as necessary.
4. Encourage the Lappalainens to participate in social activities within their community to promote mental wellbeing and combat feelings of isolation.

In conclusion, while the Lappalainens are currently managing well, it is crucial to address Kaarina's mobility concerns proactively to ensure her continued independent living. Recommended actions include a physical therapy assessment, providing information about local resources, scheduling a follow-up visit, and encouraging social engagement.
