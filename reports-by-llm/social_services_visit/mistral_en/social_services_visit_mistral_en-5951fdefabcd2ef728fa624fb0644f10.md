 Visit Report: Social Services Visit in Kaskinen, Finland (07.02.2025)

**Visit Purpose:**
The visit was conducted as a support plan review meeting for the case of Mr. Juhani Mäki, a young adult residing alone at Rantatie 16 A, Kaskinen, Finland. The purpose of this meeting was to assess the progress made since the initial intervention and to revise the support plan in light of the critical case severity.

**Observations During the Visit:**
During the visit, Mr. Mäki appeared visibly distressed and withdrawn. His living conditions were substandard, with signs of hoarding and poor hygiene evident throughout the apartment. The kitchen was cluttered, and there was a lack of fresh food supplies. Mr. Mäki's emotional state seemed fragile, and he expressed feelings of isolation and hopelessness. Notable concerns included his mental health, substance abuse issues, and inability to maintain a clean and safe living environment.

**Assessment:**
The current situation presents significant risks to Mr. Mäki's physical and mental wellbeing. His critical case severity is primarily due to the combination of his poor living conditions, mental health struggles, and substance abuse issues. The family dynamics are not applicable in this case as he lives alone.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up:**
Immediate action is required to address Mr. Mäki's critical situation. Recommendations include:
1. Referral to a mental health professional for ongoing support and treatment.
2. Arrangement of a deep cleaning service to improve the living conditions in his apartment.
3. Connection with local food banks or assistance programs to ensure access to nutritious meals.
4. Follow-up visit within two weeks to assess progress and adjust the support plan as necessary.
5. Exploration of potential housing options if significant improvements are not observed during the follow-up visit.
6. Continued monitoring and engagement with Mr. Mäki to ensure his safety and wellbeing.
