Visit Date: 16.01.2025
Location: Asikkala, Finland
Visit Type: Unaccompanied Minor Intake Assessment

Client Information:
Name: Elias Kivimäki
Address: Mannerheimintie 4A, Asikkala, 13600

Household Composition:
- Elias Kivimäki (Parent, Substance Use Disorder)
- Two minor children (Age 8 and 12)

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The visit was conducted to assess the living conditions and wellbeing of an unaccompanied minor in the household, given the presence of a parent with a substance use disorder. The purpose was to evaluate the current situation, identify any risks or concerns, and determine appropriate next steps for support services.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, the living conditions were found to be generally clean and well-maintained. However, there were signs of recent substance use in the parent's bedroom, including empty alcohol containers and a strong odor. The children appeared to be well-cared for, with adequate clothing and access to food. They seemed shy but responsive during our interaction. The parent was cooperative and open during the interview, expressing remorse for their actions and a desire to seek help.

Assessment:
The case severity is currently low due to the children's overall wellbeing and the parent's willingness to address their substance use issue. However, it is crucial to monitor the situation closely to ensure the children's safety and emotional wellbeing. The presence of substances in the household poses a risk, particularly if the parent relapses.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Refer the parent to a substance abuse treatment program for assessment and potential enrollment.
2. Arrange for regular home visits to monitor the living conditions and ensure the children's safety.
3. Provide support services for the children, such as counseling and after-school activities, to help them cope with their situation and promote their overall wellbeing.
4. Schedule a follow-up visit in two weeks to assess the progress made by the parent and the impact on the household.

It is essential to maintain open communication with all parties involved and adjust the plan of action as necessary based on the evolving circumstances. The goal is to ensure a safe, stable, and nurturing environment for the unaccompanied minor in this household.
