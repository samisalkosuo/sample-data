 Visit Report

Visit Date: 07.04.2025
Location: Akaa, Finland
Visit Type: Child Welfare Check
Household Composition: Family of four - Mr. Jari Kivinen (38), Mrs. Sanna Kivinen (36), and their children, Elias (10) and Emma (7).
Case Severity: Moderate (Chronic Domestic Violence)

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct a routine child welfare check on the Kivinen family, given their history of chronic domestic violence. The primary focus was to assess the current living conditions and emotional well-being of the children, as well as monitor any changes in the family dynamics since our last visit.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, I was greeted by a tense atmosphere within the household. Mr. Kivinen appeared agitated, while Mrs. Kivinen seemed anxious and preoccupied. The children, Elias and Emma, were playing quietly in their room. The living conditions were clean but somewhat disorganized, with signs of recent repairs to the walls and furniture.

During our conversation, Mr. Kivinen expressed remorse for his past actions and claimed that he had been attending anger management sessions regularly. However, Mrs. Kivinen appeared hesitant to fully trust him, citing several instances where she felt threatened in the past few weeks. The children were observed to be well-behaved but seemed somewhat withdrawn, particularly Elias who displayed signs of anxiety.

Assessment:
The current living conditions suggest that the family is making an effort to improve their situation, evidenced by the visible repairs within the household. However, the ongoing tension between Mr. and Mrs. Kivinen, coupled with Mrs. Kivinen's continued fear for her safety, indicates that the risk of domestic violence remains moderate. The children's emotional state also warrants concern, particularly Elias who appears to be struggling with anxiety.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
Given the current situation, it is recommended that we continue regular child welfare checks on the Kivinen family. Mr. Kivinen should be encouraged to maintain his attendance at anger management sessions and seek additional counseling for himself and the family. Mrs. Kivinen should be offered support services, such as a safety plan and counseling, to help her cope with the ongoing situation.

Additionally, it is suggested that we arrange for Elias to undergo a psychological evaluation to assess his anxiety levels and provide appropriate support if necessary. The next visit will be scheduled in two months to monitor progress and adjust recommendations as needed.
