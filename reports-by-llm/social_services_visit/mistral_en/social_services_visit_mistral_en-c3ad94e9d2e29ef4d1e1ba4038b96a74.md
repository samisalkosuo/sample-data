Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct an immigration case monitoring assessment for the household of Eero and Liisa Kivinen, in light of their critical case severity. The visit aimed to evaluate their living conditions, emotional state, and overall well-being, as part of our ongoing efforts to ensure the successful integration of new immigrants into Finnish society.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, it was noted that the living conditions within the household were substandard. The dwelling appeared cluttered, with limited personal belongings and signs of financial strain. Both Eero and Liisa seemed visibly stressed during our interaction, expressing concerns about their immigration status and employment prospects in Finland.

During the conversation, it became apparent that both siblings were struggling to adapt to their new environment, having faced numerous challenges since their arrival. They expressed feelings of isolation, cultural shock, and a lack of support networks in their new community.

Assessment:
Given the critical case severity, it is evident that the Kivinen siblings are experiencing significant difficulties integrating into Finnish society. Their emotional state suggests that they require immediate support to address their concerns and improve their living conditions. The substandard housing conditions may also pose health risks if not addressed promptly.

1. Immediate referral to a local social worker for ongoing support, counseling, and assistance with navigating the immigration process.
2. Connection to employment services to help Eero and Liisa secure stable jobs, thereby alleviating financial stress and improving their overall well-being.
3. Collaboration with housing authorities to address the substandard living conditions within the household, ensuring a safe and healthy environment for the Kivinen siblings.
4. Arrangement of cultural orientation sessions to help Eero and Liisa better understand Finnish customs and expectations, fostering a smoother integration process.
5. Regular follow-up visits to monitor progress and adjust support services as needed.

It is crucial that we act swiftly to address the critical case severity for the Kivinen siblings. By providing them with the necessary resources and support, we can help ensure their successful integration into Finnish society and improve their overall quality of life.
