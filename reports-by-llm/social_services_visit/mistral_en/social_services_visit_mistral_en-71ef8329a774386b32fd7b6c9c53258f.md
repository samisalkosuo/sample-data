 Visit Report: Raasepori, Finland - 15.04.2025

Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was a follow-up on the elderly care case in Raasepori, due to the reported high severity and the presence of a teenager with school attendance issues within the household. The aim was to assess the current situation, identify any potential risks or concerns, and discuss possible solutions and support services for both the elder and the teenager.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival at the residence located at Kauppakatu 21, Raasepori, I was greeted by a concerned elderly woman, Mrs. Sari Mäki, who expressed her worries about her grandson's school attendance and behavioral issues. The living conditions were generally clean and well-maintained, but there were signs of neglect in the teenager's bedroom, suggesting a lack of structure and supervision.

The teenager, identified as 16-year-old Eetu Mäki, was present during the visit and appeared withdrawn, with signs of emotional distress. He confirmed his school attendance issues, citing feelings of isolation and a lack of motivation. The interaction revealed a strained relationship between Eetu and his grandmother, with both parties expressing frustration and concern about the other's well-being.

Assessment:
The case presents a high level of severity due to the combined challenges of the elder's care needs and the teenager's school attendance issues and emotional distress. The living conditions are manageable but could benefit from additional support, particularly in addressing Eetu's behavioral concerns and academic struggles. The strained relationship between Eetu and his grandmother may exacerbate these issues if not addressed promptly.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Referral to a local counseling service for both Sari Mäki and Eetu Mäki to address emotional distress, improve communication, and strengthen their relationship.
2. Collaboration with the school to develop an individualized education plan for Eetu, focusing on re-engaging him in his studies and addressing any underlying issues contributing to his attendance problems.
3. Home visit from a social worker specializing in youth services to assess the need for additional support within the household, such as after-school programs or tutoring services.
4. Regular follow-up visits to monitor progress, adjust support services as needed, and ensure the continued well-being of both Sari Mäki and Eetu Mäki.

In conclusion, this visit has highlighted the need for comprehensive support services to address the interconnected challenges faced by Sari Mäki and Eetu Mäki. By implementing the recommended actions, we aim to improve their living conditions, strengthen their relationship, and ensure a brighter future for both individuals.
