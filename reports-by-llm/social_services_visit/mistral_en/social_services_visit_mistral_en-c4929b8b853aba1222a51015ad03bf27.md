Summary of Visit Purpose:
The visit was conducted as part of an urgent homeless outreach program in Kivijärvi. The purpose was to assess the living conditions and needs of Mr. Antti Mäki and his daughter Eeva, who were reported to be currently homeless and in need of immediate assistance.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival at the reported location, it was discovered that the family had been residing in a makeshift shelter near an abandoned building. The living conditions were poor, with no access to running water, electricity, or proper heating facilities. Mr. Mäki and Eeva appeared visibly tired and stressed, with signs of malnutrition and fatigue.

During the visit, both individuals expressed feelings of hopelessness and desperation due to their current situation. They shared that they had been evicted from their previous residence due to unpaid rent and were unable to secure alternative housing due to financial constraints and a lack of resources. Mr. Mäki also mentioned ongoing health issues that were exacerbated by the poor living conditions.

Assessment:
The case presents an urgent need for intervention, as the living conditions are detrimental to the physical and mental well-being of both Mr. Mäki and Eeva. The family's financial situation is precarious, and without immediate assistance, they may face further health complications and potential homelessness in the long term.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Immediate relocation to temporary housing provided by local social services, ensuring access to basic amenities such as running water, electricity, and heating.
2. Assessment of Mr. Mäki's health condition and referral to appropriate medical services for ongoing care and treatment.
3. Financial assistance to help alleviate the family's immediate financial burden and support them in finding long-term housing solutions.
4. Case management and regular follow-up visits to monitor progress, address any emerging needs, and provide ongoing support as necessary.
5. Exploration of potential employment opportunities for Eeva to improve the family's long-term financial stability.
6. Connection with local community resources and support networks to help integrate the family into the community and foster a sense of belonging.

This report serves as a call to action for all involved parties to prioritize the urgent needs of Mr. Antti Mäki and Eeva Mäki, ensuring their immediate safety and well-being while working towards long-term solutions to address their housing and financial challenges.
