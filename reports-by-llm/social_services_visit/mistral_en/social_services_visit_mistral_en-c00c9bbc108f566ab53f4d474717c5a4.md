Date: 17.05.2025

Client: Elias Kivikoski
Address: Mäkelänkatu 23, Apt. 4, Oripää, Finland

Visit Purpose:
The visit was conducted post-hospital discharge for Elias Kivikoski, a teenager currently in foster care. The purpose of the visit was to assess his wellbeing and living conditions following his hospitalization, ensure a smooth transition back into his foster home, and provide any necessary support or resources.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival at Elias's foster home, I found him to be in good spirits, engaging, and cooperative during our conversation. The living conditions were clean, well-maintained, and suitable for a teenager. Elias appeared to have adjusted well to his new environment and was actively participating in school activities.

However, there were some concerns regarding his emotional state. Elias mentioned feeling anxious about the hospital experience and expressed worries about potential health issues reoccurring. He also shared that he missed his biological family and felt a sense of loneliness at times.

Assessment:
Given the low case severity, it is encouraging to see that Elias has adapted well to his new living situation post-hospital discharge. However, his expressed feelings of anxiety and loneliness indicate a need for additional emotional support. It is essential to monitor these emotions closely to ensure they do not escalate or negatively impact his overall wellbeing.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Refer Elias to a counselor specializing in adolescent mental health to address his feelings of anxiety and loneliness.
2. Schedule regular follow-up visits to monitor his emotional state, living conditions, and academic progress.
3. Encourage open communication between Elias, his foster parents, and school staff to ensure a supportive network is in place.
4. Explore opportunities for Elias to maintain contact with his biological family, if appropriate and agreed upon by all parties involved.
5. Provide additional resources on coping mechanisms and stress management techniques to help Elias manage his anxiety.

In conclusion, while Elias has shown resilience in adapting to his new living situation following hospitalization, it is crucial to provide him with the necessary emotional support to ensure his continued wellbeing and successful integration into his foster home.
