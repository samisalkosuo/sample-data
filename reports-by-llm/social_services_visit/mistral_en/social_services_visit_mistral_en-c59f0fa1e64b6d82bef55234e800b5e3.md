Location: Savukoski, Finland

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct a support plan review meeting for the household consisting of an elderly man (Mr. Juhani Kivinen, age 78) and his adult daughter (Ms. Liisa Kivinen, age 45). The case has been classified as moderate due to the increasing care needs of Mr. Kivinen and the strain it places on his daughter.

Observations During the Visit:
During the visit, both Mr. and Ms. Kivinen were cooperative and open to discussion. The living conditions were generally clean and well-maintained, but there were signs of financial stress, with limited food supplies and outdated household appliances. Mr. Kivinen appeared frail and required assistance with daily activities, while Ms. Kivinen showed signs of exhaustion and emotional strain due to her caregiving responsibilities.

Assessment:
The current situation presents a moderate risk to both the physical and mental health of Mr. Kivinen and the emotional well-being of his daughter. The financial strain on the household, coupled with the increasing care needs of Mr. Kivinen, suggests that additional support is necessary to alleviate the burden on Ms. Kivinen and ensure the continued well-being of her father.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Financial assistance: Given the financial strain on the household, it is recommended to explore options for financial aid, such as government subsidies or grants, to help alleviate some of the financial burden.
2. Home modifications: Considering Mr. Kivinen's increasing care needs, it would be beneficial to assess the need for home modifications, such as installing grab bars, ramps, or a stair lift, to ensure his safety and independence within the home.
3. Respite care: To provide Ms. Kivinen with much-needed respite from her caregiving responsibilities, it is recommended to arrange for occasional respite care services, such as home health aides or adult daycare programs.
4. Regular follow-ups: Given the moderate case severity, regular follow-up visits will be necessary to monitor the situation and adjust support plans as needed.
5. Community resources: Explore local community resources, such as support groups for caregivers or services offering assistance with household chores, to help alleviate some of the stress on Ms. Kivinen.

In conclusion, this visit has highlighted the need for additional support to address the financial strain and increasing care needs of Mr. Juhani Kivinen and his daughter, Liisa. By implementing the recommended actions, we aim to improve their quality of life and alleviate some of the stress on both individuals.
