 Title: Social Services Visit Report - 26.07.2025

Location: Kristiinankaupunki, Finland
Visit Type: Homeless Outreach Visit
Client Name: Eero Saarinen (fictional)
Address: Linnankatu 12 A, 28100 Kristiinankaupunki

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct an outreach assessment for Mr. Eero Saarinen, a single adult with physical disability who is currently homeless. The visit aimed to evaluate his living conditions, emotional state, and identify any potential risks or needs that may require immediate attention or further support services.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon locating Mr. Saarinen in a public park, he appeared visibly tired but cooperative during our conversation. His physical disability was evident as he moved with difficulty, using a cane for support. The living conditions were makeshift, with a few personal belongings scattered around a small area under a tree. Mr. Saarinen expressed feelings of isolation and frustration due to his current situation, but maintained a positive outlook and openness towards receiving assistance. Notable concerns included his physical health, access to medical care, and long-term housing solutions.

Assessment:
Given the low case severity, Mr. Saarinen's overall condition is relatively stable, with no immediate risks identified. However, his living conditions are suboptimal, and there are concerns about his physical health and access to necessary medical care. The emotional state of feeling isolated and frustrated indicates a need for social support and connection.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Immediate referral to local healthcare services for a comprehensive physical evaluation and ongoing medical care.
2. Assistance in securing temporary shelter at a local homeless shelter, with accommodations made for his physical disability.
3. Connection to social workers and support groups that can provide emotional support and help navigate long-term housing solutions.
4. Follow-up visit within two weeks to assess progress and address any additional needs or concerns that may have arisen.

It is crucial to prioritize Mr. Saarinen's immediate medical needs while also addressing his emotional wellbeing and long-term housing stability. By providing the necessary support, we can help him transition out of homelessness and improve his overall quality of life.
