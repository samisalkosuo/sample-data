Household Composition: Transitional Housing Residents Post-Rehabilitation (Client Name: Eero Kivimäki, Address: Linnankatu 12 A, Pihtipudas)
Case Severity: Moderate

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to assess the progress and suitability of Mr. Eero Kivimäki's participation in our youth mentoring program following his rehabilitation. The program aims to provide guidance, support, and resources for individuals transitioning back into society after treatment.

Observations During the Visit:
During the visit, Mr. Kivimäki demonstrated a positive attitude and openness towards the program. He shared that he has been actively seeking employment opportunities and participating in group activities within the transitional housing facility. The living conditions appeared clean and well-maintained, with no immediate safety concerns. However, there were signs of stress and anxiety, which may be related to his ongoing job search and adjustment to post-rehabilitation life.

Assessment:
Given the moderate case severity, it is encouraging to see Mr. Kivimäki's engagement in the program and efforts towards self-improvement. However, his visible stress indicates that he may require additional emotional support to navigate this critical period effectively. The ongoing job search also presents a risk factor, as securing stable employment is essential for long-term success.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Refer Mr. Kivimäki to our counseling services for additional emotional support during this transitional phase.
2. Continue monitoring his progress in the youth mentoring program and provide regular feedback on areas of improvement.
3. Collaborate with local employment agencies to identify suitable job opportunities for Mr. Kivimäki and offer assistance with application processes.
4. Schedule follow-up visits to assess his progress and adjust support services as needed.

In conclusion, while Mr. Eero Kivimäki is making positive strides in his post-rehabilitation journey, additional emotional support and job placement assistance are recommended to ensure a successful transition back into society.
