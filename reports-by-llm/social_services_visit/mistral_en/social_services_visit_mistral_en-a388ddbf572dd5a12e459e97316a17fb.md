Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to assess the progress of the Martti family's reunification process following the recent addition of their newborn daughter, Elsa.

Mrs. Martti seemed to be coping well with the demands of caring for a newborn while managing her older children's needs. Mr. Martti was actively involved in family activities and appeared supportive.

He expressed concerns about meeting financial obligations due to reduced working hours and the additional expenses associated with a newborn. Mrs. Martti acknowledged these concerns but remained optimistic about their future.
