 Visit Report: Substance Abuse Support Visit

Visit Date: 02.06.2025
Location: Karvia, Finland
Visit Type: Substance Abuse Support Visit

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to provide ongoing support and monitoring for a single mother, Ms. Sari Kiviranta, residing at Mäkelänkatu 23, Karvia, who is currently undergoing substance abuse treatment. The visit aimed to assess her progress, address any concerns, and discuss potential next steps in her recovery journey.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, Ms. Kiviranta welcomed me warmly and appeared calm and focused. The living conditions of her home were clean and well-maintained, with a noticeable absence of alcohol or drug paraphernalia. The children, aged 7, 9, and 12, seemed happy and well-cared for, engaging in age-appropriate activities during our visit.

Ms. Kiviranta openly discussed her ongoing recovery process, expressing a strong commitment to maintaining her sobriety for the sake of her children. She shared that she has been attending regular counseling sessions and support group meetings, and has not experienced any relapses since our last visit.

Assessment:
Given the low case severity, Ms. Kiviranta's progress is encouraging. She demonstrates a clear understanding of the impact of her substance abuse on herself and her family, and appears dedicated to her recovery. The living conditions in her home are stable, and there are no immediate concerns regarding the safety or well-being of the children.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
Given Ms. Kiviranta's progress, it is recommended that we continue our regular support visits to monitor her ongoing recovery and provide additional resources as needed. I will also refer her to a local parenting support group to help her navigate the challenges of raising children while in recovery.

I will schedule a follow-up visit for 16.07.2025 to assess her continued progress and discuss any additional support that may be required. In the meantime, I encourage Ms. Kiviranta to continue attending counseling sessions and support group meetings, and to reach out if she encounters any difficulties or setbacks.

Overall, it is heartening to see Ms. Kiviranta's commitment to her recovery and the positive impact this is having on her family. With continued support and dedication, I am confident that she will continue to make significant strides in her recovery journey.
