 Visit Report: Safety Plan Monitoring Visit - 13.07.2025

Location: Tuusniemi, Finland
Visit Type: Safety Plan Monitoring Visit
Household Composition: Two-parent household (Mr. and Mrs. Järvinen) with reported neglect case (Child A, age 8)
Case Severity: Moderate

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to assess the progress and implementation of the safety plan established for the Järvinen family, following reports of neglect towards their child. The visit aimed to evaluate the living conditions, family dynamics, and overall well-being of Child A, as well as to provide support and guidance in addressing any identified concerns.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, the Järvinens welcomed the social worker warmly. The living conditions were generally clean and orderly, with signs of ongoing efforts to maintain a safe and nurturing environment for Child A. However, there were some concerning observations regarding the parents' ability to consistently prioritize their child's needs.

During the visit, it was noted that Mr. Järvinen appeared preoccupied and stressed, while Mrs. Järvinen seemed more engaged with the social worker and Child A. The interactions between the parents and their child were observed to be strained at times, with a noticeable lack of emotional connection and attentiveness from both parties.

Child A was observed to be quiet and reserved during the visit, appearing somewhat withdrawn. When asked about school and daily activities, the child provided brief responses without much enthusiasm or detail. There were no visible signs of physical harm, but there were concerns regarding the child's emotional well-being and overall development.

Assessment:
The Järvinen family's situation is currently classified as moderate in severity, with a need for ongoing support and monitoring to ensure the safety and well-being of Child A. The observed strained interactions between the parents and their child, combined with the child's reserved demeanor, suggest that there may be underlying emotional issues that require professional intervention.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Referral to a family therapist for counseling sessions to address the identified emotional concerns and improve family dynamics.
2. Ongoing monitoring of the Järvinen family's progress in implementing the safety plan, with regular follow-up visits to assess the child's well-being and the parents' ability to meet their child's needs.
3. Provision of additional resources and support services as needed, such as parenting classes or financial assistance, to help the Järvinens create a more stable and nurturing home environment for Child A.
4. Continued collaboration with local schools and healthcare providers to ensure that Child A's needs are being met both at home and in other settings.
5. Re-evaluation of the case severity after several months, based on the family's progress and continued adherence to the safety plan.
