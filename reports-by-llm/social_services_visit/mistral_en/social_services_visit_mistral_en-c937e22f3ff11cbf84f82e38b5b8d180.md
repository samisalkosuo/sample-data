 Visit Report

Visit Date: 08.10.2024
Location: Hankasalmi, Finland
Visit Type: Domestic Violence Risk Assessment
Household Composition: Married couple (Mr. & Mrs. Järvinen) with four children aged 6, 9, 11, and 13 years old.
Case Severity: High

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct a risk assessment for domestic violence within the Järvinen household due to the reported high severity of the case. The visit aimed to evaluate the current situation, identify potential risks, and assess family dynamics in order to provide appropriate recommendations for support services and follow-up actions.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, it was evident that the living conditions were substandard, with signs of neglect and disrepair throughout the home. The interactions between Mr. and Mrs. Järvinen were tense, with verbal altercations occurring frequently during the visit. Both parties displayed emotional instability, with Mrs. Järvinen appearing visibly distressed and Mr. Järvinen exhibiting signs of aggression.

The children were observed to be withdrawn and fearful, often hiding when arguments ensued between their parents. The eldest child, a 13-year-old girl, appeared particularly anxious and was reluctant to engage in conversation. It was noted that the children's school performance had suffered as a result of the ongoing domestic violence.

Assessment:
The high case severity is justified given the observed emotional instability, aggressive behavior, and substandard living conditions within the Järvinen household. The tense interactions between Mr. and Mrs. Järvinen, combined with the children's fearful demeanor, indicate a dangerous environment that poses immediate risks to the family's well-being.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
Immediate action is required to ensure the safety of the Järvinen family. It is recommended that social services initiate emergency protective measures, including temporary removal of the children from the home and provision of safe housing for the family.

In addition, counseling services should be provided for both Mr. and Mrs. Järvinen to address their emotional instability and aggressive behavior. The children would also benefit from individual therapy to help them cope with the trauma they have experienced.

A follow-up visit is scheduled within two weeks to assess the progress made in implementing these recommendations and to determine if further support services are necessary. It is crucial that ongoing monitoring and intervention continue until a safe and stable environment can be established for the Järvinen family.
