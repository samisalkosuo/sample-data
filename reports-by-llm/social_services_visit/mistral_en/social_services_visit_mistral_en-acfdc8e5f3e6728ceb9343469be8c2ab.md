Client Information:
Name: Eero Kivimäki (Eero Maki in English)
Address: Tietotie 12, Apt. 3, Pihtipudas, Finland
Household Composition: Disabled adult (Eero Kivimäki) and live-in caregiver (Anna Laine)
Case Severity: Moderate

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to assess the living conditions and wellbeing of Mr. Eero Kivimäki, a disabled adult residing in Pihtipudas, Finland, and to provide necessary support services based on the moderate case severity.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival at Tietotie 12, Apt. 3, we found Mr. Kivimäki and his live-in caregiver, Ms. Anna Laine, in a small but clean apartment. The living conditions were modest, with basic furniture and essential amenities present. Mr. Kivimäki appeared to be in good spirits, engaging in conversation and expressing gratitude for the visit. However, it was evident that he struggled with mobility due to his disability. Ms. Laine demonstrated a strong commitment to caring for Mr. Kivimäki, but expressed concerns about their financial situation and the strain it places on their living conditions.

Assessment:
The moderate case severity is primarily attributed to the financial struggles faced by Mr. Kivimäki and Ms. Laine. The small apartment and limited resources suggest a need for additional support services to improve their quality of life. It is essential to address the financial concerns to ensure that Mr. Kivimäki receives adequate care and that Ms. Laine's efforts are not unduly burdened.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Financial Assistance: Investigate eligibility for social assistance programs to alleviate the financial strain on the household.
2. Home Adaptations: Evaluate the need for home adaptations to better accommodate Mr. Kivimäki's mobility issues, such as installing handrails or a wheelchair ramp.
3. Regular Check-ins: Schedule regular follow-up visits to monitor the situation and provide ongoing support as needed.
4. Referrals: Connect Mr. Kivimäki and Ms. Laine with local resources for additional assistance, such as food banks, healthcare services, or counseling services.

By addressing these recommendations, we aim to improve the living conditions and wellbeing of Mr. Eero Kivimäki and his live-in caregiver, Ms. Anna Laine.
