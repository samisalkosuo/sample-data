Client: Mr. Jari Mäki (45 years old), residing at Linnankatu 12 A, Kärkölä, Finland

Visit Purpose: The visit was conducted to assess the financial hardship of the household and provide necessary support due to the parent's substance use disorder and its impact on the family.

Observations During the Visit: Upon arrival, it was evident that the living conditions were substandard, with signs of neglect and disorganization throughout the apartment. Mr. Mäki appeared visibly anxious during our conversation but cooperative in answering questions about his situation. He expressed concern for his children's wellbeing and acknowledged the impact of his substance use on their lives. The children, aged 10 and 12, were present during the visit and seemed withdrawn and hesitant to engage.

Assessment: The case presents a moderate level of severity due to the parent's ongoing substance use disorder and its negative effects on the family's financial stability and living conditions. The emotional wellbeing of both Mr. Mäki and his children appears to be at risk, with signs of stress and anxiety present during our visit.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up: Immediate referrals are necessary for substance abuse treatment and counseling services for Mr. Mäki. Additionally, we will work with local social services to provide financial assistance and connect the family with resources for improving their living conditions. Regular follow-ups will be scheduled to monitor progress and adjust support as needed.

It is crucial that Mr. Mäki actively participates in his treatment program and prioritizes the wellbeing of his children during this challenging time. We encourage him to seek additional support from family, friends, or community resources if necessary.

In conclusion, a comprehensive approach involving substance abuse treatment, financial assistance, and ongoing support services will be essential for improving the living conditions and emotional wellbeing of Mr. Mäki and his children.
