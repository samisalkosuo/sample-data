Client Information:
Name: Sari Kivimäki (Surname changed for confidentiality)
Address: Mannerheimintie 12 A, 60100 Raahe

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to provide post-abuse recovery support and assess the current living conditions of Sari Kivimäki and her newborn infant. Given the critical case severity, it is essential to ensure the safety and wellbeing of both mother and child, and to evaluate the progress made in their recovery process.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, I was warmly greeted by Sari, who appeared visibly anxious but determined. The living conditions were clean and orderly, with a clear emphasis on creating a safe environment for her newborn infant. Sari displayed a cooperative attitude during our conversation, openly discussing her experiences and expressing a strong desire to move forward with her recovery.

However, there were notable concerns regarding Sari's emotional state. She exhibited signs of anxiety and stress, which may be related to the traumatic events she has recently experienced. It is essential that these emotions are addressed through ongoing counseling and support services.

Assessment:
The critical case severity indicates that Sari has been subjected to severe abuse, which has likely had a profound impact on her emotional wellbeing and ability to care for herself and her newborn infant. The living conditions, while clean and orderly, suggest that Sari is making an effort to create a safe environment but may require additional resources and support to fully address the ongoing challenges she faces.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Continued post-abuse recovery support, including regular counseling sessions to address emotional trauma and provide coping strategies.
2. Referral to local parenting support groups to help Sari navigate the challenges of caring for a newborn while managing her recovery process.
3. Collaboration with healthcare providers to ensure that Sari and her infant receive necessary medical care and monitoring.
4. Regular follow-up visits to assess progress, address any emerging concerns, and provide ongoing support as needed.
5. Exploration of potential housing assistance options if financial constraints are identified as a barrier to maintaining a safe living environment for Sari and her infant.

In conclusion, while Sari has made significant strides in creating a safe living environment for herself and her newborn, there are still concerns regarding her emotional wellbeing that require immediate attention. Ongoing post-abuse recovery support, counseling, and collaboration with local resources will be essential to ensuring the continued safety and wellbeing of both Sari and her infant.
