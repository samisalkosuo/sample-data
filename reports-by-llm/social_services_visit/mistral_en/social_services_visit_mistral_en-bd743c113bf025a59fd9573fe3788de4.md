 Visit Report: Safety Plan Monitoring Visit - 21.07.2025

Location: Loviisa, Finland

Client: Anna Lehto (30 years old) and her infant daughter, Emilia, living with parents at Vuosaarenkatu 2A, Loviisa, 46800

Visit Purpose: The visit was conducted as a safety plan monitoring visit due to the urgent case severity involving a teenage mother and her infant residing with their parents. The purpose of this visit was to assess the progress made in implementing the safety plan, monitor the living conditions, and evaluate the family dynamics.

Observations During the Visit: Upon arrival, Anna appeared visibly anxious but cooperative. Her parents were present during the visit and seemed supportive. The living conditions were generally clean and safe, with a designated space for Emilia's belongings. However, there were signs of emotional tension between Anna and her parents, particularly regarding financial matters and parenting responsibilities.

Assessment: The case severity indicates that immediate attention is required to ensure the safety and well-being of both mother and infant. While the living conditions appear acceptable, the emotional tension within the household could potentially escalate if not addressed promptly. It is essential to provide additional support services to help alleviate financial stressors and improve communication between family members.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up: In light of the assessment, it is recommended that the following actions be taken:

1. Financial assistance: Provide temporary financial aid to help ease the financial burden on the household, allowing for a more stable environment.
2. Parenting support: Refer Anna and her parents to parenting classes to improve their understanding and communication regarding child-rearing responsibilities.
3. Counseling services: Offer counseling sessions for both Anna and her parents to address any underlying emotional issues contributing to the tension within the household.
4. Regular follow-ups: Schedule regular visits to monitor progress, assess the effectiveness of implemented measures, and adjust the safety plan as necessary.
5. Emergency contact information: Provide emergency contact information for local resources in case of escalating tensions or immediate safety concerns.

By addressing these recommendations, we aim to improve the living conditions, reduce emotional tension, and ensure the safety and well-being of Anna, her infant daughter, and their family.
