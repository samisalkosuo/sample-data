Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to assess the safety and well-being of Ms. Kiviranta and her children, following the implementation of a safety plan due to escalating domestic violence incidents. The visit aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the safety measures put in place, address any ongoing concerns, and discuss potential next steps.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, I was greeted by Ms. Kiviranta who appeared visibly relieved and appreciative of our continued support. The living conditions were found to be clean and safe, with no immediate signs of distress or danger. The children were observed playing quietly in separate rooms, while Ms. Kiviranta shared her experiences since the last visit.

Ms. Kiviranta reported a significant decrease in violent incidents, attributing this improvement to the safety plan and the support services provided. However, she expressed ongoing concerns about the perpetrator's potential for retaliation and the emotional impact on her children. Ms. Kiviranta displayed a resilient demeanor but admitted to struggling with feelings of guilt and fear for her family's future.

Assessment:
The current situation indicates a marked improvement in safety, thanks to the implemented safety plan and support services. However, the case remains urgent due to the ongoing risk of retaliation from the perpetrator and the emotional trauma experienced by Ms. Kiviranta and her children. The family dynamics are complex, with Ms. Kiviranta taking on a strong protective role while simultaneously grappling with her own emotions.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Continue monitoring the safety plan and provide ongoing support to Ms. Kiviranta and her children.
2. Arrange for counseling sessions for both Ms. Kiviranta and her children to address their emotional needs and help them cope with the traumatic experiences.
3. Collaborate with local law enforcement to ensure increased vigilance and protection for the family, particularly in light of potential retaliation from the perpetrator.
4. Schedule a follow-up visit within two months to reassess the situation and adjust support services as necessary.
5. Explore long-term housing solutions to provide Ms. Kiviranta and her children with a safe and stable environment.
6. Offer financial assistance to alleviate any immediate financial burdens resulting from the domestic violence incidents.
7. Provide resources for legal action against the perpetrator, should Ms. Kiviranta decide to pursue this option.

In conclusion, while significant progress has been made in ensuring the safety of Ms. Kiviranta and her children, ongoing support and vigilance are essential to maintain their well-being and prevent future incidents. The recommended actions aim to address the family's immediate needs while working towards long-term solutions for a safer and more secure future.
