Location: Hämeenkyrö, Finland
Visit Type: Post-abuse recovery support visit
Household Composition: Two-parent household (Mr. and Mrs. Järvinen) with reported neglect case (Child A, 7 years old)
Case Severity: Low

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to provide post-abuse recovery support following the resolution of a reported neglect case involving Child A. The visit aimed to assess the family's progress in addressing the issues that led to the initial report, monitor their adherence to the agreed safety plan, and offer additional resources for continued healing and growth.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, both parents (Mr. and Mrs. Järvinen) warmly welcomed the social worker into their home. The living conditions were clean and well-maintained, with Child A appearing to be in good health and spirits. The family displayed a cooperative attitude throughout the visit, openly discussing their experiences since the initial report and expressing a commitment to improving their parenting skills.

During the conversation, it was evident that both parents had made significant efforts to understand the impact of their actions on Child A and were actively working towards rebuilding trust within the family. Emotional vulnerability was present, particularly from Mrs. Järvinen, who expressed feelings of guilt and a desire to make amends for past mistakes.

Notable concerns included Mr. Järvinen's initial reluctance to discuss certain aspects of the case, as well as his tendency to minimize the severity of the neglect. However, it is important to acknowledge that these behaviors may be indicative of ongoing emotional struggles and a need for further support.

Assessment:
The low case severity reflects the family's progress in addressing the reported neglect and their commitment to improving their parenting skills. The living conditions were satisfactory, and both parents demonstrated a willingness to engage with the social worker and participate in the recovery process.

However, it is essential to continue monitoring the family's adherence to the agreed safety plan, particularly Mr. Järvinen's engagement in therapy and his ability to acknowledge and address any lingering emotional issues that may impact his parenting.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Continue post-abuse recovery support visits on a biweekly basis for the next three months to assess progress, offer additional resources, and provide ongoing emotional support.
2. Refer Mr. Järvinen to a licensed therapist specializing in trauma and family dynamics to address any lingering emotional issues that may impact his parenting.
3. Schedule a follow-up visit with Child A's school counselor to discuss the child's progress, emotional well-being, and any potential concerns related to the neglect case.
4. Encourage Mr. and Mrs. Järvinen to attend a local support group for parents who have experienced similar challenges to foster continued growth and healing within the family.
5. Provide resources on positive parenting techniques and healthy communication strategies to reinforce the family's efforts in improving their parenting skills.
