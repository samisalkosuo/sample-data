### **Observations During the Visit**

During the visit, Mrs. Lehto was seen in her home, which is situated in a quiet neighborhood near Haapavesi. She appeared calm but showed signs of forgetfulness, as she mentioned having grandchildren but struggled to recall their names. Her ability to perform daily tasks seemed impaired, and she occasionally required assistive devices such as a bath chair for mobility.

The living environment was tidy, with her personal belongings arranged neatly. However, there were concerns about her potential isolation given limited interactions with family members during the visit. Additionally, her communication was intermittent, which could hinder her ability to fully engage in family activities or seek help if needed.

1. **Cognitive Decline:** Mrs. Lehto exhibited early signs of dementia, impacting her memory and communication abilities. This could affect her ability to manage daily tasks independently.
   
2. **Isolation Risk:** Limited interaction with family members suggested a potential isolation risk, which warrants further monitoring.

3. **Support Needs:** The family may require additional support services, such as social worker referrals or therapeutic interventions, to address the cognitive decline and mitigate isolation risks.
