### **Assessment**

The assessment indicates that Anna's truancy rate remains low, with no immediate risks of recurrence. Her engagement in school activities has shown improvement since the last visit, but she still requires ongoing support to sustain this progress. The low case severity suggests that targeted interventions are sufficient for managing her current situation.

However, there is a need to address potential underlying stressors related to her living environment and physical disability. Without addressing these factors, long-term stability could be jeopardized if not managed proactively.
