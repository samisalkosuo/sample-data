### Summary of Visit Purpose  
The purpose of this visit was to assess the progress of Elina Kivipelto, an unaccompanied minor in temporary housing, following her initial social services assessment. The visit aimed to support her post-abuse recovery by evaluating her emotional well-being, living environment, and engagement in recovery activities.

### Observations During the Visit  
Elina is currently residing in a stable temporary housing unit in Sievi. She appears to be making steady progress toward her recovery goals, attending weekly support groups with peers who have similar experiences. Her emotional state shows signs of improvement, though occasional stressors from past trauma occasionally affect her mood.

### Assessment  
Given the case severity of low risk, Elina's situation is manageable but requires continued support. She has access to necessary resources and is engaging in recovery activities, which is commendable. However, temporary housing stability is crucial to prevent potential triggers or relapse.

### Recommended Actions or Follow-up  
1. **Follow-up Session:** Schedule a monthly follow-up with her social worker to monitor progress.
2. **Resource Provisioning:** Provide access to counseling services and support groups to enhance her recovery journey.
3. **Housing Stability:** Ensure continued temporary housing stability, possibly exploring long-term solutions if conditions improve.
4. **Emotional Monitoring:** Monitor her emotional well-being closely, especially during stressful periods.
5. **Exit Planning:** If her situation stabilizes, consider exit planning discussions with relevant authorities.

Elina remains a key focus for ongoing support and intervention to ensure sustained recovery and stability in Sievi.
