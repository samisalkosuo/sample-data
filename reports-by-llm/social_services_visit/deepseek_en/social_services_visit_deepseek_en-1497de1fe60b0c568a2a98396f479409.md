### **Observations During the Visit**

During the visit, interactions with the parents were cordial and cooperative. The minor child appeared healthy and engaged in activities that suggested a stable environment. The home was clean and adequately equipped for the child's needs. 

The parents provided clear updates on their custody arrangements, confirming that both have ongoing commitment to the child's care. However, there were concerns about the consistency of daily routines, such as meal preparation and extracurricular activities, which could impact the child's well-being.

The social worker noted that the family seemed to be in a period of adjustment post-custody changes, with some routine tasks not yet fully established. The home environment appeared safe but lacked the structured routine necessary for maintaining consistent care.

### **Assessment**

The case is currently low severity due to minimal risk factors associated with abuse or neglect. The parents have demonstrated commitment and cooperation in managing custody arrangements. However, there are areas for improvement:

1. **Stability of Custody Arrangements:** While the parents maintain custody, there is room for enhancing routine follow-up on daily tasks like meal preparation and extracurricular activities to ensure continuity.
2. **Structured Routine:** The home environment could benefit from a more structured routine to support the child's well-being.

No immediate concerns were identified that would necessitate further intervention or referrals at this time.
