### Summary of Visit Purpose  
The purpose of this visit was to conduct a domestic violence risk assessment for Mrs. Anna Maria Kivipelto, an elderly woman with early dementia symptoms. As part of our casework, we evaluated her living situation and potential risk factors related to domestic violence.

### Observations During the Visit  
During the visit, Mrs. Kivipelto appeared cooperative but exhibited signs of forgetfulness typical of her dementia. She struggled with understanding questions, often responding incoherently or with incomplete sentences. Her disorientation made it challenging to provide a comprehensive history of her situation. Observationally, she kept her room tidy and maintained a calm demeanor without appearing overly joyful.

Notably, she did not express any signs of domestic violence during the interaction. However, her limited understanding of questions suggested potential barriers to accessing support services or reporting issues.

### Assessment  
Given Mrs. Kivipelto's age and early dementia symptoms, the risk level is moderate. While there is no direct evidence of abuse, her cognitive limitations may hinder accurate assessment of her full history. Her cooperation and apparent calmness suggest she may not be actively engaged in harmful behaviors but warrant continued monitoring.

### Recommended Actions or Follow-up  
1. **Home Visit:** Schedule a follow-up home visit within one week to assess living conditions further and ensure no signs of domestic violence.
2. **Social Worker Referral:** Referral to a social worker for additional support services tailored to her needs, including assistance with communication barriers.
3. **Support Group Engagement:** Consider arranging a community-based support group to provide emotional support and practical advice.
4. **Follow-up Meeting:** Arrange a meeting after the home visit to discuss findings and next steps.
