### Summary of Visit Purpose  
The purpose of this visit was to follow up on the well-being of Ms. Anna Kivimäki, a 72-year-old resident in Sulkava, Finland. The visit aimed to assess her current health and living situation, ensure she meets her living goals, and address any concerns related to her care requirements or family dynamics.

### Observations During the Visit  
During the visit, interactions with both Ms. Kivimäki and her teenager, aged 16, revealed several notable observations:  
- **Ms. Kivimäki:** She appeared generally well but showed signs of stress, possibly due to ongoing concerns about her teenager's school attendance issues. She expressed a desire for more support in managing her daily tasks and maintaining her independence.  
- **Teenager:** The teenager reported attending school with some difficulty, citing personal challenges at home. He exhibited disengagement during the visit, which may reflect his broader emotional state.  

Living conditions were generally tidy but lacked a sense of routine. Ms. Kivimäki mentioned that her son had recently returned from a trip and was causing minor disruptions at home by bringing home items unrelated to school.

The case severity is moderate, indicating that while the situation requires attention, it does not currently pose immediate health or safety risks. Key concerns include:  
- **Emotional State:** Ms. Kivimäki's stress levels are concerning and may stem from her teenager's behavior.

No immediate health risks were identified, but ongoing monitoring of the teenager's behavior is recommended.
