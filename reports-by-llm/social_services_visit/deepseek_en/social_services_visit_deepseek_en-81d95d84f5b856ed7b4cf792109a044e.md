### **Summary of Visit Purpose**

The purpose of this visit was to conduct a Parental Capacity Evaluation for a critical case involving a refugee family in temporary accommodation.

Given the severity of their situation, this evaluation is essential to assess the parents' ability to provide adequate care for their children while ensuring their well-being and safety.

### **Observations During the Visit**

During the visit, several factors were noted that highlight the current challenges and concerns:

1. **Living Conditions:** The family resides in temporary accommodation with inadequate living conditions. The housing unit is disheveled, with dirty floors, insufficient furniture, and poor lighting. This creates a stressful environment for both parents and children.

2. **Emotional State of Parents:** Both parents appeared worried and anxious during the visit. They expressed concerns about their ability to provide for their children in their home country due to ongoing instability. Their emotional state was visibly affected by the challenges they face, indicating a high level of stress and anxiety.

3. **Children’s Behavior and Emotional State:** The children displayed signs of fear and anxiety, particularly when discussing their separation from their parents. While they complied with instructions given by the caseworker, there were moments where their behavior suggested difficulty in adapting to the temporary living conditions.

4. **Potential for Further Concerns:** The lack of basic necessities (e.g., clean water, proper clothing) increases the risk of further stress and anxiety among both parents and children. Additionally, cultural incongruence between the refugees and local community members may exacerbate existing tensions.

### **Assessment**

Based on the observations and the critical case severity, the following assessment is made:

- **Immediate Risks:** The family's temporary living conditions are significantly substandard compared to what would be expected for a family of five in Finland. This includes inadequate shelter, basic necessities, and emotional support. These factors increase the risk of further stress and anxiety among all family members.

- **Parental Capacity:** While the parents have shown willingness to comply with services, their ability to provide care is hindered by the challenging living environment. Their emotional state suggests a high likelihood of separation from their children in the near future, which could lead to instability if not addressed promptly.

- **Children’s Emotional Health:** The children are showing signs of anxiety and fear, particularly regarding their separation from their parents. This indicates that they may require additional support to manage these emotions effectively.

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Secure temporary accommodation for the family in a more suitable living environment.
   - Conduct an assessment of parental capacity to ensure they can provide adequate care and emotional support for their children.

2. **Follow-up Actions:**
   - Schedule weekly check-ins with the parents to monitor their well-being and address any emerging concerns.
   - Develop a case management plan (CMP) in collaboration with relevant stakeholders, including social workers and healthcare providers, to ensure comprehensive support for all family members.

3. **Support Services:**
   - Provide psychological support to both parents to help them manage anxiety and stress related to their children's separation.
   - Arrange cultural sensitivity training for the parents to enhance their ability to adapt to life in Finland while maintaining cultural ties with their home country.

4. **Referrals:**
   - Refer the family to appropriate long-term support services, including counseling and social worker assignments, to ensure sustained care throughout their stay in temporary accommodation.
