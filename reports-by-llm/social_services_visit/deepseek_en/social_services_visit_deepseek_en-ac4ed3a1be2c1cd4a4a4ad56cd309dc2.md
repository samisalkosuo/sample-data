During the visit, Mr. Kivipelto appeared calm and composed but showed signs of anxiety when asked about his daily routine. He maintained basic hygiene and attended to essential tasks such as cooking meals and household chores. However, he did not engage in conversation or show interest in spending time with Ms. Lehto beyond her presence during the visit.

Notable observations included:
- Mr. Kivipelto's daily schedule was structured but lacked variety.
- He appeared disengaged from his daughter, indicating a lack of emotional connection and social interaction.
- No signs of abuse or neglect were observed.

### **Assessment**

The assessment indicates that Mr. Kivipelto is capable of maintaining basic daily activities independently. However, the low level of engagement with his daughter raises concerns about potential strain on family dynamics if his health deteriorates. The family relationship appears strained due to limited interaction and emotional disengagement.

Given the current severity rating (low), immediate intervention is not required. However, continued monitoring is essential to ensure that Mr. Kivipelto's capacity does not decline further or lead to a deterioration in the family situation.

3. **Support Groups:** Arrange weekly support groups for both Mr. Kivipelto and Ms. Lehto to foster communication and emotional support between them.
