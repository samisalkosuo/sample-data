**Social Services Visit Report**

**Date:** September 10, 2024  
**Location:** Ulvila, Finland  

---

### **Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted as a follow-up to assess the well-being of Ms. Anna Maria Kivipelto following her relocation from her previous residence in Ulvila. The primary objective was to evaluate her current living situation and emotional state to ensure her continued safety and independence.

### **Observations During the Visit**

During the visit, Ms. Kivipelto interacted calmly but appeared less engaged compared to previous interactions. She resides in shared housing with other elderly residents, which she refers to as "the house." She expressed a desire to maintain her current lifestyle but mentioned that her mind has become slower over time.

Her emotional state was observed to be calm and composed, yet there were noticeable signs of withdrawal. She discussed her past life with some detail but seemed hesitant to delve deeper into topics related to her previous residence. Concerns were raised regarding her ability to keep up mentally in the new environment and potential isolation due to limited social interactions.

### **Assessment**

Given Ms. Kivipelto's early dementia symptoms and moderate case severity, it is important to monitor her progress closely. While she appears stable at present, the ongoing cognitive decline suggests that continued support may be necessary to mitigate further deterioration. The family dynamics have shown some strain due to the timing of the previous occupant's departure.

There are no immediate risks of acute distress or instability but require attention to ensure her well-being does not deteriorate further. Regular monitoring and timely interventions will be crucial in addressing any emerging concerns.

### **Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. **Weekly Monitoring:** Schedule weekly follow-ups to assess her progress and emotional state, ensuring ongoing support is provided as needed.
2. **Cognitive Stimulation:** Arrange activities that can help maintain cognitive function without causing undue stress.
3. **Privacy Support:** Ensure she has access to a private space for discussing sensitive topics related to her past.
4. **Social Services Involvement:** If signs of decline persist, consider involving social services to provide additional support or resources.

This report highlights the importance of continued vigilance in supporting Ms. Kivipelto's well-being and underscores the need for proactive measures to address potential challenges as they arise.
