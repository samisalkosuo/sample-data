### **Summary of Visit Purpose**

### **Observations During the Visit**

During the visit, the client appeared cooperative but slightly fatigued. The living conditions were clean and well-maintained, with no significant issues observed. Both partners seemed to be adhering to their prescribed medication regimen. However, one partner reported feeling withdrawn, particularly during sleep, while the other partner was in good spirits.

Notably, there was an incident where one partner tried to leave but was stopped by the other. No major concerns were raised regarding safety or living conditions.

The cohabiting relationship appears healthy, though individualized support may be necessary to address the withdrawing symptoms in one partner.
