### **Observations During the Visit**  
1. **Living Conditions**: The family resides in a clean and safe home environment. The youth appears to be living independently with consistent routines, but there are noticeable gaps in support systems due to their foster care exit.  
2. **Financial Hardship**: The household exhibits signs of financial stress, including limited savings and recent debt obligations. The parent's employment status is precarious, with inconsistent income that may not provide long-term support for the family.  
3. **Emotional State**: The youth expresses concerns about their future, indicating potential mental health challenges or unresolved issues from foster care placement. Emotional dynamics within the household are strained, suggesting possible neglect or abuse risks if not addressed promptly.

### **Assessment**  
Given the critical case severity, the following risks and family dynamics have been identified:  
- **Mental Health Concerns**: The youth's emotional well-being is at risk due to past trauma and foster care exit. This could escalate into substance abuse, further complicating financial stability.  
- **Financial Instability**: Limited savings and inconsistent income create vulnerability to future shocks, such as unexpected expenses or economic downturns.  
- **Family Dynamics**: Strained relationships may lead to neglect or abuse if interventions are not implemented promptly.

2. **Referrals**:  
   - Referral to mental health services for the youth to address potential emotional or behavioral issues.  
   - Referral to substance abuse prevention programs to mitigate possible alcohol or drug use.  

3. **Case Management Plan**:  
   - Develop a detailed case management plan with timelines for follow-up visits (every 60 days) and targeted interventions based on the identified risks.  
   - Explore long-term support options, such as foster care reunification services or community-based programs tailored to the family's needs.
