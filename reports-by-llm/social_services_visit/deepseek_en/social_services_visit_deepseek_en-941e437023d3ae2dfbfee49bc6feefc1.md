### **Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted as part of an immigration case monitoring visit to assess the family's situation regarding their child's immigration status and living conditions in Janakkala. The primary focus was on evaluating the teenager's academic performance and the family dynamics, ensuring ongoing support for the child while addressing any concerns related to their well-being.

### **Observations During the Visit**

The client is a 24-year-old woman with two children: a 15-year-old experiencing school attendance issues and her 7-year-old son. The family resides in a modest apartment in Janakkala, facing challenges such as limited heating and basic furniture. The teenager actively interacts socially but struggles academically, which may impact her immigration status. Tensions between the parents are evident, particularly over the child's school situation.

### **Assessment**

The moderate case severity indicates that while there are concerns related to the teenager's academic performance and family dynamics, immediate intervention is not required beyond monitoring. The family's living conditions contribute to stress, potentially affecting the child's well-being. Counseling for the parents may be beneficial to improve family relations and support the child's academic success.

### **Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

- **Follow-up Visit:** Schedule a follow-up in two weeks to assess progress on the teenager's school attendance.
- **Parental Counseling:** Offer counseling services to address family tensions and parenting challenges.
- **Child Care Support:** Provide access to reliable child care support for the parents.
- **Monitor Academic Performance:** Continue monitoring the teenager's academic performance to ensure it meets immigration criteria.

This report outlines the necessary steps to support the family while addressing their concerns. Regular follow-ups will ensure ongoing support tailored to the family's needs.
