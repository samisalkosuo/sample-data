### Summary of Visit Purpose  
The purpose of this visit was to conduct a follow-up on the parenting education provided earlier for Anna Lehto, a teenage mother and her infant living with her parents in Vihti. The goal is to assess the implementation of parenting strategies discussed during the education sessions and evaluate any progress made since the last assessment.

### Observations During the Visit  
Upon arrival, we greeted Anna and her infant, who was sleeping comfortably in their home. The family appeared to be in a slightly cramped living arrangement typical for small-town Vihti. Anna engaged in activities with support from her parents, demonstrating proactive parenting despite her challenges. Her 2-year-old infant showed signs of sleepiness but was fed promptly by Anna's partner. Emotional-wise, Anna expressed occasional anxiety about balancing work and parenting responsibilities but appeared motivated to seek help.

Notable concerns included limited time for herself outside of childcare and potential stress from work demands, which could impact the child's development.

### Assessment  
The situation is currently manageable with moderate case severity. Parenting education has likely improved her approach to child-rearing, evidenced by her interactions during the visit. However, further encouragement is needed for consistent implementation of recommended strategies. The family dynamics appear balanced, with extended support from both parents and occasional involvement from Anna's partner.

### Recommended Actions or Follow-up  
A follow-up visit is scheduled 6 weeks post-visit to assess progress on parenting strategies. If concerns persist, referrals to additional resources such as parenting classes or counseling will be considered. Support services are recommended if significant challenges arise in the next assessment.

This report reflects a structured approach to evaluating Anna's parenting situation and ensuring her well-being and that of her infant.
