### **Summary of Visit Purpose**

The purpose of this routine family wellbeing visit was to assess the mental and emotional well-being of Emma Johnson, a young adult living alone in Ähtäri. As part of our ongoing care program for young adults in solitary living situations, we conducted this check-up to ensure her mental health is supported and to identify any potential areas of concern.

### **Observations During the Visit**

During the visit, Emma appeared to be in a generally positive mood but showed signs of mild stress. Her living environment was tidy but somewhat disorganized, which may contribute to her emotional state. Notably, she mentioned increased work pressures at her part-time job and reported feeling isolated despite being surrounded by routine tasks.

### **Assessment**

The case presents a moderate severity level with some minor concerns regarding stress from work pressures and social isolation. These factors are manageable with appropriate support and intervention. No immediate crisis was identified, but regular monitoring is recommended to ensure her well-being does not deteriorate.

### **Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. **Follow-up Visit:** A follow-up visit will be scheduled in two weeks to reassess Emma's emotional state and address any emerging concerns.
2. **Therapy Sessions:** If stress levels remain elevated, we may recommend additional therapy sessions tailored to her specific needs.
3. **Social Connections Support:** We will arrange support for Emma to connect with local social services or community groups to enhance her social interactions.
4. **Monitoring:** Close monitoring of her stress levels and living environment will be conducted to ensure ongoing well-being.

This report reflects a comprehensive evaluation based on the provided details, ensuring that all necessary steps are taken to support Emma's mental health effectively.
