### **Summary of Visit Purpose**

The purpose of this visit was to assess a low-severity refugee family in temporary accommodation for substance abuse support. The family consists of a mother and two children, currently residing in temporary housing due to their refugee status. This follow-up visit aimed to evaluate their current situation, provide necessary support, and ensure ongoing well-being.

### **Observations During the Visit**

During the visit, the family appeared stable with no signs of acute distress. The mother, Mrs. Leena Kivipelto, actively engaged with local authorities and displayed a proactive approach to seeking help. The children showed good academic performance and maintained positive social interactions. However, one child exhibited concerning alcohol use behavior, indicating potential areas for intervention.

Living conditions were clean and organized, though minor stressors from the refugee situation could influence substance use patterns. No immediate threats or safety concerns were observed.

### **Assessment**

The family is in a low-risk state with overall good health and stability. The mother actively seeks support services, and children demonstrate positive development. One child's alcohol use requires attention but does not pose an imminent threat. Immediate safety risks are absent.

### **Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

A follow-up visit in 6 weeks will monitor the child's progress and address any emerging issues. Additionally, referring the family to local substance abuse services is recommended for comprehensive support.
