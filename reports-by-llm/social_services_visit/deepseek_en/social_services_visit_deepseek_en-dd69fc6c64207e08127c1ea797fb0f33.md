### Observations During the Visit  
During the visit, the elderly parent was observed in a different part of the house compared to previous visits. This observation suggested an increase in mobility or a change in routine. The parent appeared calm but seemed slightly more withdrawn than usual. Notably, there were no signs of severe distress, but the caregiver reported that the parent's eating habits had changed, with fewer meals being consumed and less frequent calls for assistance.
