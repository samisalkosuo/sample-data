### Observations During the Visit  
During the visit, Ms. Kivipelto appeared fatigued and struggled to recall questions posed by the social worker. Her living environment was described as somewhat cluttered but safe. She expressed apathy towards daily tasks such as cooking meals or paying bills. Notably, her financial independence was a concern due to her dementia symptoms potentially affecting her decision-making abilities.

### Assessment  
The assessment indicates that Ms. Kivipelto can handle basic household responsibilities but may face challenges with more complex financial decisions in the future. The moderate severity suggests she is not yet fully dependent on others for managing finances, but her cognitive decline could lead to dependency if left unchecked. Family dynamics and support services are noted as potential risks.
