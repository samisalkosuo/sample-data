### Summary of Visit Purpose  
The purpose of this visit was to conduct a domestic violence risk assessment for Ms. Martti Nieminen, an elderly woman with early dementia symptoms. The primary goal was to evaluate her current safety, identify any signs of domestic violence, and ensure she feels secure in her living environment.

### Observations During the Visit  
During the visit, Ms. Nieminen appeared calm but withdrawn, suggesting possible discomfort or pain. Her home, located at Kumpula Street 45, was neat yet outdated, indicating limited recent movement. She expressed difficulty with daily tasks like cooking and personal care, likely exacerbated by her dementia.

She mentioned her husband left the family home a few months ago without explanation, raising concerns about potential domestic violence. Ms. Nieminen appeared concerned but maintained a calm demeanor, trying to manage her situation while feeling vulnerable.

### Assessment  
The risk level is moderate due to the husband's withdrawal and potential emotional impact on Ms. Nieminen. The severity of the case is low, indicating no immediate threats but necessitating ongoing monitoring and support.

### Recommended Actions or Follow-up  
A follow-up visit in two weeks will assess her well-being further. Additional support services, such as counseling and daily task assistance, are recommended. She should be aware of local domestic violence resources for further support if needed.
