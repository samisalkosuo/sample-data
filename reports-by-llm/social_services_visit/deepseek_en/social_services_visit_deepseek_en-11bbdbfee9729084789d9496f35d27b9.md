### Observations During the Visit  
Upon arriving at the residence, the social worker interacted with the household consisting of a 17-year-old youth (referred to as "Youth A") and her mother. The visit occurred during a time when Youth A appeared calm but exhibited signs of acute distress. She was in possession of recently moved personal belongings, indicating she had just relocated into the shared apartment.  

The living environment was described as cluttered, with disorganized furniture and incomplete items in the kitchen. This condition raises concerns about safety and mental well-being. No evidence of domestic abuse or neglect was observed during the visit. Youth A expressed fatigue and anxiety about returning home to her family's care, which underscores the need for additional support during this transition period.
