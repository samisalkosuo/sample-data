### **Observations During the Visit**

Upon arriving at their home in Salla, we observed a calm yet tense atmosphere. Mrs. Lehto appeared distracted and seemed to be under significant stress, possibly due to recent family conflicts. The living environment was somewhat disorganized with remnants of an argument found near the dining area. Mr. Lehto was present but appeared less engaged, which raised concerns about his emotional state.

The children displayed signs of anxiety during our interaction, indicating a potentially stressful home environment. No immediate threats were observed, but the overall mood suggested heightened tension and instability in the family dynamics.

### **Assessment**

Given the moderate case severity, we assessed that while domestic violence incidents are present, they do not warrant immediate police intervention. The family's living conditions and emotional state suggest a need for targeted support without escalation to emergency measures.

The assessment highlights potential underlying issues such as unresolved financial disputes or personal conflicts affecting the family's stability. The children's emotional well-being is at risk due to the strained parent-child relationship, necessitating attention to their psychological health.

### **Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. **Immediate Support:** Provide access to counseling services for both parents to address potential stress and emotional strain.
2. **Risk Assessment Plan:** Develop a structured plan focusing on financial counseling and parenting support to stabilize the family environment.
3. **Follow-up Visits:** Schedule periodic check-ins every three months to monitor progress and adjust interventions as needed.
