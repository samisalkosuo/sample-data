### Summary of Visit Purpose  
The purpose of this visit was to assess the compliance of a juvenile with their probation terms at a moderate case severity. The visit aimed to ensure adherence to behavior modification plans and ongoing obligations, such as attending therapy sessions and maintaining a stable home environment.

### Observations During the Visit  
During the visit, interactions with the family revealed cooperative behavior from the juvenile, who appeared attentive to instructions. Living conditions were deemed acceptable, though minor concerns about stress due to displacement were noted. The juvenile displayed signs of adjustment challenges typical in refugee families, indicating potential emotional strain but no immediate risks.

### Assessment  
The assessment indicates that while the child is compliant with probation requirements, underlying stress from displacement may affect their well-being. The home environment appears stable, yet there are opportunities for improvement in mental health support and family dynamics. No severe risks were identified, but moderate concerns exist regarding long-term emotional impact.

### Recommended Actions or Follow-up  
1. **Additional Support Services**: Provide access to mental health counseling services tailored to refugee families.
2. **Compliance Monitoring**: Schedule weekly check-ins to ensure continued adherence to probation terms.
3. **Family Support**: Engage with local social workers for ongoing family support and resources.
4. **Follow-up Visits**: Plan quarterly visits to monitor progress and address any emerging concerns.

This report underscores the need for targeted interventions to support the juvenile's adjustment while maintaining a stable living environment.
