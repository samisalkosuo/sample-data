**Date:** 19.12.2024  
**Location:** Posio, Finland

### Summary of Visit Purpose  
The purpose of this visit was to conduct a mental health monitoring check on a high-severity case involving a child living with a non-custodial relative in Posio, Finland. The primary goal was to assess the child's current mental health status and ensure there are no signs of deterioration that could lead to a reduction in risk category.

### Observations During the Visit  
During the visit, the client reported that the child was in good spirits but exhibited significant anxiety about returning home. The living conditions were described as somewhat disheveled with visible cluttered items. The child appeared withdrawn and had limited interaction with others. Notably, the child's emotional state was noted to be anxious, which raised concerns about their readiness for reintegration into a custodial environment.

### Assessment  
The current situation presents elevated risk levels due to the high severity of the case. The permanency plan's effectiveness is under scrutiny given the child's anxiety and potential underlying issues such as trauma or attachment problems not adequately addressed by the non-custodial arrangement. Further evaluation is necessary to determine if additional support services are required.

### Recommended Actions or Follow-up  
1. **Follow-up Visit:** A subsequent visit with a higher risk threshold will be conducted to assess the child's progress and mental health status.
2. **Support Services:** Additional support services, including therapy, may be recommended based on the observations.
3. **Professional Involvement:** Further evaluation by other professionals is advised to explore potential underlying issues affecting the child's stability.
