### Summary of Visit Purpose  
The purpose of this visit was to monitor compliance with the established Safety Plan for an adult residing in Kolari, Finland. Given the high severity of the individual's severe mental health condition, the primary focus was on assessing their safety, well-being, and ability to manage their circumstances independently.

### Observations During the Visit  
During the visit, interactions were polite but indicated a withdrawal from social engagement. The living environment appeared clean and organized, suggesting some level of self-care routine. However, notable signs of agitation were observed, which raised concerns about the individual's emotional state and capacity for self-care. Emotional indicators suggested anxiety or stress, possibly exacerbated by isolation. Concerns were also raised regarding the adequacy of support networks and access to necessary resources.

### Assessment  
The individual's high severity condition necessitates immediate intervention. The assessment highlights significant risks related to potential harm to self or others due to severe mental health. There are concerns about the individual's ability to maintain independence without adequate support, strained family dynamics, and limited access to essential services. Stabilization measures are critical, along with ensuring emergency contacts for rapid response in case of emergencies.

### Recommended Actions or Follow-up  
Immediate action is required to contact local emergency services and arrange stabilization. Support networks should be established through a trusted relative or professional counselor. Regular monitoring of the individual's compliance with the Safety Plan will ensure ongoing safety and well-being. If necessary, long-term care arrangements should be considered to address underlying mental health needs.
