### Summary of Visit Purpose  
The purpose of this visit was to assess the progress made by the client in her post-abuse recovery journey. As a mother of two children with recent custody changes and a high case severity, it was crucial to evaluate her readiness for supervised visits with her children and ensure the safety and well-being of both herself and the children.

### Observations During the Visit  
The visit occurred at the client's residence in a shared custody arrangement. The client appeared anxious but made efforts to maintain a calm demeanor during the interaction. She expressed concerns about her ex-partner's lack of cooperation, which has impacted their living environment. The living conditions were shared with her ex-partner, who was not actively engaged and seemed focused on his own needs rather than hers or the children's. The client reported that the children are doing well but noted increased stress levels due to the recent custody changes.

### Assessment  
The child welfare appears stable as both children continue to engage in activities conducive to their development. However, there is a high risk of re-abuse given the unstable custody arrangements and the lack of cooperation from her ex-partner. The family dynamics are strained, with limited communication between parents, which could exacerbate emotional distress for the children.

### Recommended Actions or Follow-up  
1. **Follow-up Visits**: Schedule supervised visits with the children to monitor their progress and ensure ongoing safety.
2. **Support Services**: Provide additional support services tailored to the client's needs, focusing on managing stress and improving custody arrangements.
3. **Mediation/Counseling**: Arrange mediation or counseling sessions for both parents to address unresolved issues and improve communication.
4. **Ongoing Oversight**: Continue close oversight of the case by social services until stabilization is achieved.
