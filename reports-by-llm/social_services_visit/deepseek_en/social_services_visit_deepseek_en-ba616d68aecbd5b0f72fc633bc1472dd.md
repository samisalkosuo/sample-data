### **Assessment**

The assessment revealed a balanced situation with no immediate risks identified. Margareta's living environment appears safe, and the safety plan is functioning as intended. However, minor organizational issues (e.g., misplaced mobility aids) could be addressed to enhance efficiency. The moderate case severity suggests that while some support may be needed in the future, there are no critical risks at this time.
