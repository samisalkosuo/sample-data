- **Interactions:** Mr. Antti Lehto, the father, was cooperative but stressed about his children's substance use. He expressed willingness to seek help despite initial resistance from his wife.
- **Living Conditions:** Basic yet adequate, with no signs of neglect or severe issues. Financial strain impacts their ability to provide a stable environment.

**Assessment:**  
The situation is low severity with manageable risks. While substance abuse affects the children's well-being, it does not require immediate intervention beyond support. Financial difficulties may worsen issues if addressed without urgency. Strained family dynamics contribute to substance use and its effects.
