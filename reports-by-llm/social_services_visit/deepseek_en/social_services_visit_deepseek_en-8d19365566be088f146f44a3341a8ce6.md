### **Summary of Visit Purpose**

This routine family wellbeing visit was conducted to assess the current well-being of Mr. K and Mrs. L, parents of their 10-year-old son Timo, following recent custody changes. The primary objective was to evaluate their emotional stability, living conditions, and any concerns related to their child's care and parental mental health.

### **Observations During the Visit**

The visit took place in a shared home located in Muonio, where Mr. K works remotely from home, while Mrs. L manages household responsibilities. The living environment is functional but cluttered, with no immediate safety risks identified. Timo appears to be cooperative and engaged during interactions.

Mr. K exhibits signs of stress due to his work schedule and custody arrangements, while Mrs. L demonstrates emotional engagement but reports ongoing concerns about the stability of their blended family structure. Timo's behavior suggests some separation anxiety, though he remains calm and cooperative.

The home environment is deemed stable in terms of safety, but minor decluttering could enhance living conditions without posing risks to Timo or the parents.

### **Assessment**

Given the moderate case severity, the situation does not currently pose immediate threats. The parents' mental health requires ongoing support, particularly with managing stress related to custody changes and child well-being. The blended family structure may benefit from further communication between parents to ensure Timo's emotional stability.

No significant concerns were identified that would require immediate intervention beyond routine follow-up visits. However, ongoing monitoring is recommended to address any emerging issues.

### **Recommended Actions or Follow-Up**

2. **Referrals:** Referrals to child protection services will remain a contingency plan based on ongoing concerns.
3. **Support Services:** Consider providing access to counseling resources or parenting courses to assist Mr. K and Mrs. L in managing stress and improving their custody arrangements.
