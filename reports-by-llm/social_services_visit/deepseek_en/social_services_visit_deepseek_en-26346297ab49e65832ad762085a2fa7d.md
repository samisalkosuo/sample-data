### Summary of Visit Purpose  
The purpose of this visit was to assess the safety and well-being of a child identified as at risk due to living with a non-custodial relative in an unstable household. The visit aimed to evaluate the current situation, identify any risks, and ensure the child's immediate protection while awaiting court proceedings.

### Observations During the Visit  
The child appeared distressed but was cooperative during the interview. The home inspection revealed clean living conditions, though signs of neglect were present, including cluttered furniture and incomplete cleaning tasks. The child expressed difficulty focusing on school despite ongoing challenges at home. No significant concerns related to emotional harm or physical safety were observed.

### Assessment  
The moderate case severity indicates a need for prompt intervention. The non-custodial relative's role appears insufficient in providing adequate support, potentially exacerbating instability. There is a risk of further neglect or emotional harm if not addressed promptly. Family dynamics are strained, suggesting the necessity of additional support to stabilize the child's environment.

### Recommended Actions or Follow-up  
1. **Court-Ordered Hearing**: Conduct an assessment hearing to evaluate the child's needs and determine the most appropriate intervention plan.
2. **Social Worker Follow-Up**: Schedule a follow-up visit within 7 days to monitor progress and address any emerging concerns.
3. **Case Management Plan**: Develop a tailored case management plan involving social services, healthcare providers, and mental health professionals.
4. **Support Services**: Provide access to mental health counseling and parenting education programs to strengthen the family's support network.
