---

### Summary of Visit Purpose  
The purpose of this visit was to conduct a comprehensive safety check for the newborn and to assess the well-being of both the mother and child. Given the high case severity due to the woman's ongoing recovery from domestic abuse, the primary focus was on evaluating her ability to provide a safe and stable environment for the infant while addressing any underlying emotional or health concerns.

### Observations During the Visit  
1. **Living Environment:** The home appeared clean and well-maintained, with all necessary items present, including formula and diapers. The kitchen was equipped with basic safety measures.
2. **Mother's Condition:** The mother displayed signs of emotional instability but made efforts to care for the infant. She seemed fatigued but appeared to be in a relatively safe environment without immediate threats.
3. **Child's Behavior:** The infant exhibited normal developmental milestones, indicating no signs of neglect or distress during the visit.

### Assessment  
The assessment revealed that while the mother is actively attempting to support her child, she faces significant challenges due to her emotional state and ongoing domestic abuse. The living conditions were deemed safe at this time, but there are concerns about the long-term impact of abuse on both the child's well-being and the mother's ability to provide a stable environment.

### Recommended Actions or Follow-up  
1. **Immediate Interventions:** Additional support services for both the infant and the mother, including counseling and parenting education, should be scheduled.
2. **Ongoing Monitoring:** More frequent visits will be necessary to track progress and address any emerging issues promptly.
3. **Referrals:** Referral to local child protection services is recommended to ensure the safety of the child in case further intervention is needed.

This report outlines the current situation while emphasizing the need for continued support to safeguard both parties involved.
