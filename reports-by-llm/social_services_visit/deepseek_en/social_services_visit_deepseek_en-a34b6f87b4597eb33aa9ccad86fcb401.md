**Social Services Visit Report**

**Date of Visit:** 06.09.2024  
**Location:** Merijärvi, Finland  

---

### **Summary of Visit Purpose**

The purpose of this visit was to conduct a safety check on the newborn and family unit in Merijärvi, Finland. Given the family's history of chronic domestic violence, it is crucial to assess both the immediate safety of the infant and the potential long-term impact on the child due to ongoing trauma.

### **Observations During the Visit**

During the visit, interactions with the parents revealed a tentative acceptance of the social worker's presence. The family lives in an apartment that appears structurally sound but shows signs of neglect, such as incomplete furniture and minor damage. The parents displayed emotional distance, avoiding direct eye contact and expressing concerns about their living conditions.

The infant was placed on a bassinet, indicating they are currently sleeping, which is concerning given the history of domestic violence. The parents expressed fear of returning to their previous home but did not provide further details, leaving room for follow-up questions.

### **Assessment**

The family's ongoing trauma from domestic violence poses moderate risks to the child's emotional and physical well-being. While the severity level is low, the lack of immediate threats necessitates continued monitoring. The parents' tentative acceptance suggests they may be in a vulnerable state, requiring support services tailored to their needs.

### **Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. **Follow-up Visit:** Schedule a follow-up within 30 days to reassess the family's living conditions and child's well-being.
2. **Support Services:** Referral to local social services for ongoing support and counseling due to domestic violence history.
3. **Legal Considerations:** A preliminary review of legal actions may be warranted if necessary, though no immediate concerns were identified.

This report highlights the need for continued engagement with the family to ensure the child's safety and well-being while addressing their underlying issues.
