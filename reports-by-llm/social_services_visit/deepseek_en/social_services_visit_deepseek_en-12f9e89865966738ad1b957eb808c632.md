### **Summary of Visit Purpose**

The purpose of this visit was to provide comprehensive support and assessment for Mrs. Sanna Lehto, an elderly resident with early dementia symptoms, who is experiencing substance abuse. The visit aimed to evaluate her current living situation, assess the risks associated with her condition, and ensure her safety while linking her to appropriate resources.

### **Observations During the Visit**

During the visit, several key observations were made:

1. **Deteriorating Health Condition**: Mrs. Lehto exhibited signs of a weakened health status, including difficulty breathing and frequent trips to the restroom.
2. **Living Environment**: Her home was in decent condition but showed signs of neglect. The living space appeared sparse, with limited kitchen facilities that could hinder her ability to manage daily tasks independently.
3. **Behavioral Indications**: She struggled to communicate clearly due to dementia, which made it challenging for staff to understand her needs fully. However, she maintained a calm demeanor during the visit.
4. **Substance Abuse Concerns**: There were no visible signs of substance use within the home, but her limited cognitive function could affect her ability to seek help or manage her condition effectively.

### **Assessment**

Given the high case severity:

1. **Health Risks**: Her deteriorating health poses significant risks, including potential complications from neglect and ongoing health issues.
2. **Living Conditions**: The living environment may not adequately support her independence, increasing the risk of further harm if not addressed promptly.
3. **Family Dynamics**: While no direct concerns were noted, her dementia symptoms could strain family relationships and impact her ability to manage her well-being effectively.

### **Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

To address the high severity case:

1. **Immediate Safety Checks**: Conduct a thorough assessment of her living environment to ensure it meets basic safety requirements.
2. **Home Modifications**: Consider temporary modifications to enhance her ability to manage daily tasks independently, such as adding kitchen facilities.
3. **Referrals to Support Services**: Referral to local elderly support groups and community centers for additional care tailored to her needs.
4. **Monitoring and Follow-up**: Schedule regular follow-up visits to closely monitor her condition and living environment.
5. **Legal Considerations**: If necessary, explore legal options to ensure her safety in the home.
