### **Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at Pyläri, a disused industrial site now converted into temporary housing, the team conducted an unstructured observation. The family appeared visibly distressed, with one member showing signs of anxiety and the other appearing overwhelmed by the situation. The living conditions were substandard, with poor maintenance evident in the lack of heating, basic furnishings, and limited access to essentials like food and clean water.

The family exhibited behaviors consistent with their history of domestic violence, including emotional detachment and a lack of cooperation with social services. One member expressed frustration at the challenges they face but indicated a willingness to engage in support services if guided properly. The children seemed distressed, showing signs of neglect and inadequate supervision.

Notable concerns included the instability of living conditions, potential health risks due to poor maintenance, and the family's ongoing struggle to cope with domestic violence while attempting to escape an abusive environment.

### **Assessment**

The family is in moderate distress, facing significant barriers to stability. Their history of chronic domestic violence places them at risk of further harm or escalation. The living conditions are unsafe and inadequate, increasing the likelihood of health complications and substance abuse. The children's emotional well-being is likely compromised by the family's instability.

Immediate actions are required to address their housing needs and provide psychological support. Referrals to appropriate services, including counseling and temporary housing, are recommended to stabilize the family temporarily while plans are made for long-term solutions.
