### Summary of Visit Purpose

The purpose of this visit was to assess the effectiveness and impact of the youth mentoring program on the children under the supervision of Mr. and Mrs. Lehto. The social worker evaluated their interactions with the children, observed family dynamics, and assessed any challenges that might affect the program's outcomes.

### Observations During the Visit

During the visit, the social worker engaged with both children, aged 12 and 14, who displayed varying levels of engagement in school activities. The younger child appeared more focused on studies but exhibited some behavioral issues at home, possibly due to stress from parenting responsibilities. The older child showed improved social interactions but had inconsistent homework completion.

The parents were cooperative and provided detailed information about their household situation. They reside in shared living quarters, which may contribute to increased stress levels. Both parents expressed concerns about balancing their roles as new parents with their duties in the mentoring program.

### Assessment

The assessment revealed moderate case severity due to underlying stressors affecting the family's ability to provide a stable environment for the children. The parents' cooperative nature suggests they are responsive to support, but ongoing monitoring is necessary to address potential stress impacts on the mentoring program's effectiveness.

### Recommended Actions or Follow-up

1. **Additional Support Services:** Referenced counseling services for both parents to manage stress and parenting challenges.
2. **Enhanced Monitoring:** Increased oversight of the children's progress in the mentoring program to ensure consistent support.
3. **Program Adjustment:** Consider adjusting the mentoring structure if stress levels among parents are not mitigated, potentially through flexible scheduling or additional resources.
4. **Follow-up Visits:** Schedule quarterly check-ins to track changes and reassess family dynamics.

This report highlights the need for continued support to address moderate case severity while maintaining a balanced approach to parenting and program involvement.
