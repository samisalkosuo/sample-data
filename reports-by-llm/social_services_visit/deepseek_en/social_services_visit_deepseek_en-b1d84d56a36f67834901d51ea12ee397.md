### Summary of Visit Purpose  
This visit was conducted as a follow-up to the young adult's discharge from the hospital following an urgent case. The primary purpose was to assess her mental health stability and ensure she is able to transition back into her daily living environment safely and independently.

---

### Observations During the Visit  
Upon arrival, the client appeared distressed but remained seated in her apartment for most of the visit. She expressed concerns about feeling isolated due to her solitary living situation. The living area was clean but lacked essential items such as a heating system (despite being in Helsinki, which typically has consistent temperatures). Her emotional state fluctuated between moments of anxiety and occasional moments of calm.

### Assessment  
The young adult's mental health appears to be on the edge of improvement, with some progress noted since her hospital discharge. However, her social isolation remains a significant concern, potentially exacerbating any underlying stressors. The absence of family support in the immediate vicinity increases the risk of relapse or further deterioration.

### Recommended Actions or Follow-up  
1. **Follow-up Visit**: Schedule a subsequent visit within 7 days to reassess her mental health and living environment.
2. **Case Management**: Refer to a caseworker for additional assessment and support planning.
3. **Support Services**: Referral to local social services for potential therapy or counseling services.
4. **Housing Support**: Provide resources for accessing housing assistance if needed.
