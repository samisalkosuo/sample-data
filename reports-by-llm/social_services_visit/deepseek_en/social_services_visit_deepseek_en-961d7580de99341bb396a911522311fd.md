### **Assessment**

The household faces moderate financial hardship, with monthly expenses exceeding income by 15%. While they maintain savings, the absence of an emergency fund poses a risk if unexpected expenses arise. The couple's ability to manage daily costs suggests they are not in immediate danger but require support to stabilize their financial situation.
