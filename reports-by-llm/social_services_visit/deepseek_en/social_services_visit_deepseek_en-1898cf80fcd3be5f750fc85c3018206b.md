---

### Summary of Visit Purpose  
This visit was conducted as a follow-up to monitor the well-being and support needs of Ms. Anna Kivipelto, who resides in a shared living situation with her partner. The purpose is to ensure ongoing care, assess any changes from the last visit, maintain her quality of life, and address potential risks related to her mental health.

### Observations During the Visit  
Ms. Kivipelto was cooperative but exhibited signs of fatigue and withdrawal during the conversation. Her living environment, shared with another couple, is clean but somewhat isolated. Concerns were noted regarding sleep disturbances due to noise from the adjacent household, potentially linked to work activities or other household members.

### Assessment  
The client's case severity remains low, indicating overall good well-being. However, there are moderate risks: a potential decline in well-being if unaddressed, possible isolation-induced mental health challenges, and increased stressors from the shared living environment. Current support includes social services, primary caregivers, and community resources.

### Recommended Actions or Follow-up  
1. **Next Home Visit:** Schedule another visit within two weeks to reassess her well-being and monitor any changes.
2. **Therapy Sessions:** Continue supporting her through recommended therapy sessions if needed.
3. **Social Services Monitoring:** Have social workers closely monitor her condition for any deterioration.
4. **Isolation Support:** If concerns persist, explore additional social activities or support groups to enhance her isolation resilience.

This report reflects a balanced approach to ongoing care and risk management, ensuring Ms. Kivipelto's well-being is sustained in her shared environment.
