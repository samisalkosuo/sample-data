### Summary of Visit Purpose  
The purpose of this visit was to follow up on the parenting education provided earlier and assess the current functioning of the family in Pyhtää.

### Observations During the Visit  
The visit occurred in the client’s home, where she was actively engaged with her children, who were both under 10 years old. The family appeared to be in a relatively stable living environment, despite some challenges at home. The mother displayed a positive attitude and expressed willingness to make changes as needed. However, concerns were noted regarding sleep disturbances for the children and occasional stress from work-related pressures. Additionally, there was a noted lack of formal parenting training beyond what had been provided initially.

### Assessment  
The family functioning overall appeared stable, with the children appearing well-behaved and engaged in their activities. The mother demonstrated an understanding of her responsibilities but acknowledged the need for additional support to manage stress and improve sleep quality. No significant risks or threats were identified during the visit. The family dynamics were cooperative, with minimal conflicts observed.

Given the low case severity, no immediate interventions are required. However, it is recommended that the client continue receiving weekly parenting education sessions and access additional resources such as counseling services for stress management. Regular follow-up visits will be scheduled to monitor progress and ensure ongoing support.
