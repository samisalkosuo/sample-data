### Summary of Visit Purpose  
This visit was conducted as part of a domestic violence risk assessment for a married couple with four children. The primary objective was to evaluate the current situation and identify any risks associated with domestic violence within their household.

### Observations During the Visit  
During the visit, interactions between the couple revealed that the husband appeared somewhat distant, while his wife showed signs of stress but remained calm. The living conditions were described as cluttered and cold, which may contribute to emotional strain. The children exhibited signs of anxiety but did not demonstrate violent behavior during the visit.

### Assessment  
The assessment indicates a moderate risk level for domestic violence within the household. The husband's behavior suggests ongoing emotional conflict, potentially stemming from past incidents. The family dynamics are strained, with the wife expressing concerns about the husband's emotional state and his impact on their children. Immediate intervention is recommended to address the husband's issues.

### Recommended Actions or Follow-up
