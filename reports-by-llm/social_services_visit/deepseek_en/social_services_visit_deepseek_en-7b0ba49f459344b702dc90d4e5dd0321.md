### Summary of Visit Purpose  
The purpose of this visit was to conduct a welfare check on the child residing in Joroinen under the supervision of a non-custodial relative. The primary objective was to assess the child's well-being and ensure that their living conditions align with the necessary standards for child welfare.

### Observations During the Visit  
During the visit, the social worker interacted with the child and the non-custodial relative. The child appeared to be in a stable environment, engaging in activities that suggested a healthy development pace. Emotional indicators were positive, with no signs of stress or neglect observed. The living conditions were clean and adequately equipped for the family's needs.

### Assessment  
The case severity is low, indicating minimal immediate risks to the child's welfare. The non-custodial relative demonstrated compliance with social services obligations, and there are no significant concerns about the child's emotional or physical well-being. However, it was recommended to monitor the situation closely over the next few months to ensure continued stability.

### Recommended Actions or Follow-up  
The social worker will schedule a follow-up visit in approximately four weeks to assess any potential changes in the child's environment. If no significant issues are identified, no further interventions will be necessary. In case of any concerns arising during this period, additional support services or referrals to relevant social services may be considered.
