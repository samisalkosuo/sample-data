### Summary of Visit Purpose  
The purpose of this visit was to assess the financial stability of Ms. Anna Kivipelto and Mr. Juha Kivipelto, a young couple expecting their first child. As household financial hardship reviews focus on evaluating the ability of families to meet basic needs while managing additional responsibilities such as parenthood, this visit aimed to determine if they currently face significant financial challenges that could impact their stability.

### Observations During the Visit  
During the visit, Ms. Kivipelto appeared cooperative but expressed concerns about balancing childcare and household expenses. Her living conditions were modest, with a shared apartment that seemed cluttered and not fully equipped for a new family. She mentioned difficulty managing monthly bills due to reduced income from her previous job and the additional burden of parenthood.

Mr. Kivipelto provided details about their current financial situation, including part-time work and childcare arrangements. He expressed some anxiety about the long-term financial implications of having a child but did not mention any immediate financial difficulties beyond what was already apparent in the living conditions.

Both appeared to be emotionally engaged, acknowledging their stress but not indicating any signs of substance abuse or neglect.

They seem capable of covering immediate needs but may struggle with long-term financial planning due to limited savings and uncertain income sources. Their emotional state reflects the stress of parenthood, which could potentially escalate if not managed proactively.
