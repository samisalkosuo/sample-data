### **Summary of Visit Purpose**

The purpose of this visit was to assess the integration support needs of a child whose family is in moderate distress. The primary focus was on evaluating the child's emotional well-being, living environment, and family dynamics to determine appropriate intervention strategies.

### **Observations During the Visit**

During the visit, interactions with both parents revealed significant tension and strained relationships. The child appeared emotionally distressed, exhibiting signs of anxiety during the interview. Living conditions were substandard, with dirtiness and inadequate furniture contributing to a less-than-optimal environment. Notably, there were reports of disciplinary issues at home, including limited access to resources for schoolwork.

### **Assessment**

The moderate severity indicates that while challenges exist, they are manageable with targeted support. Key findings include strained parent-child relationships, potential neglect trends in the child due to lack of supervision, and the need for improved living conditions. The family dynamics suggest a need for additional social services and parenting courses to enhance stability.

### **Recommended Actions or Follow-up**
