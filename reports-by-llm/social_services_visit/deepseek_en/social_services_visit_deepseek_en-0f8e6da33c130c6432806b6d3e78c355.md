### **Summary of Visit Purpose**

The routine family wellbeing visit was conducted to assess the well-being of Mrs. Anna Lehto, an elderly individual with dementia residing in a single-family home alongside her husband, Mr. Timo Lehto. The primary objectives were to evaluate her emotional state, monitor any behavioral changes, ensure safety, and confirm adequate support from the caregiver, Maria Kivipelto.

### **Observations During the Visit**

During the visit, Mrs. Lehto appeared calm but exhibited signs of anxiety, particularly noticeable at evening hours when she withdraws more from interactions. The home environment was clean and well-organized, with Maria assisting in daily tasks such as bathing and dressing. However, Mrs. Lehto struggled with consistent meals, missing her dinner and indicating difficulty with personal care.

Notably, the couple's communication was strained, with Mr. Lehto expressing concerns about his wife's increasing dependency. The atmosphere remained safe, but there were concerns regarding her potential decline in independence and the need for further support services if current strategies are insufficient.

### **Assessment**

Given the low case severity, minor adjustments to Mrs. Lehto's care are recommended. Her anxiety can be managed with behavioral strategies, though her dining habits require attention. The home environment is stable, reducing risk of neglect or abuse. However, ongoing monitoring and tailored support services are advised to address potential future needs.

### **Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

A follow-up visit in two weeks will monitor progress on Mrs. Lehto's well-being and reinforce positive behaviors. Continued support services, including social activities and daily task assistance, are recommended. Consulting with a geriatric psychiatrist may be considered for medication management if anxiety persists.
