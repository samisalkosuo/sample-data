**Social Services Visit Report: Järvenpää, Finland - 06.09.2024**

---

**Summary of Visit Purpose:**  
The visit was conducted to assess the domestic violence risk level in the household led by Mrs. Anna Lehto, a single mother with three children. As part of a low-severity case, the primary focus was to evaluate her safety and the family's overall well-being.

**Observations During the Visit:**  
During the visit, Mrs. Lehto appeared cooperative but expressed signs of stress and anxiety. Her living conditions were modest, with disheveled furnishings in an otherwise clean apartment. She seemed fatigued and showed concern about her children's safety. Notable concerns included a lack of resources for daily needs and a strained family dynamic.

**Assessment:**  
The risk level is low due to the absence of immediate threats. The family dynamics are strained, possibly due to unresolved conflicts or emotional strain from parenting responsibilities. No imminent harm was identified, but ongoing support may be beneficial.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up:**  
- **Immediate Action:** Contact social services if no changes occur within 30 days.
- **Follow-up:** Schedule a revisit in 30 days to monitor progress and address any emerging issues.
