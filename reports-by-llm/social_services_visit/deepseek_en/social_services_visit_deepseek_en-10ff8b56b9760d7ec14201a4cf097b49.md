### Summary of Visit Purpose

The purpose of this visit was to conduct a Parental Capacity Evaluation for a child residing with a non-custodial relative. Given the critical severity of the case, the evaluation aimed to assess whether the child can manage their responsibilities independently due to significant capacity issues related to emotional, psychological, or developmental challenges.

### Observations During the Visit

During the visit, interactions revealed that the child appeared anxious and showed signs of neglect towards their living situation. The living conditions were substandard, with inadequate facilities and poor maintenance affecting the child's well-being. Concerns were raised about the child's substance use and the relative's behavior, which seemed concerning and potentially concerning for the child's safety.

### Assessment

The assessment indicates that the child has substantial capacity issues leading to neglect and emotional distress. There are significant risks of further harm, including possible abuse. The family dynamics are strained, with the non-custodial relative exhibiting behaviors that could exacerbate the child's emotional state. The critical severity underscores the need for immediate intervention to stabilize the situation.

### Recommended Actions or Follow-up

1. **Risk Assessment:** Conduct a detailed risk assessment to evaluate the potential for further harm and identify factors contributing to the child's neglect.
2. **Therapy for the Child:** Provide psychological therapy to address capacity issues, emotional distress, and substance use concerns.
3. **Support Services:** Offer support services to both the child and the non-custodial relative to improve living conditions and parenting skills.
4. **Legal Consultation:** Advise on legal implications and potential referrals for further intervention or protective measures.
5. **Follow-up Visits:** Schedule regular follow-ups to monitor progress, maintain case stability, and ensure compliance with recommended actions.

This report highlights the urgent need for comprehensive support to stabilize the child's environment and address underlying capacity issues. Immediate action is crucial to prevent further deterioration of the child's well-being.
