### **Observations During the Visit**

Upon arriving at the residence, the social worker interacted with the family, including the mother (in her 40s) and the child in question. The home was modestly furnished but appeared to be comfortable and relatively clean. The atmosphere seemed tense, with the mother expressing concerns about the financial strain on the family and its potential impact on the child's future.

The child, a teenager, displayed signs of anxiety during the interaction, appearing withdrawn and avoiding direct eye contact. The social worker noted that the child seemed aware of the challenges but did not appear to be actively engaged in harmful behaviors or displaying signs of immediate danger. However, there were concerns about the family's financial stability affecting their ability to provide a stable environment for the child.

The extended family was present, including relatives who appeared concerned about the situation and willing to assist but stressed the need for additional support due to the financial difficulties.

The family's financial instability is a significant concern, potentially exacerbating stress for both the child and parents.

The extended family's willingness to assist indicates a desire to support the child, but additional resources may be necessary to address the financial strain and ensure the child receives appropriate care and support.
