### **Summary of Visit Purpose**

The purpose of this visit was to assess the effectiveness of the youth mentoring program in supporting a young person and their family dynamics involving an elderly grandparent with dementia. The visit aimed to evaluate how well the program is meeting the needs of both the mentee and the caregiver, ensuring that the support provided aligns with best practices for elderly care.

### **Observations During the Visit**

During the visit, interactions between the young person (Ari Tuomela) and his grandmother (Irmeli Lehto) were observed. Ari displayed a positive attitude but showed signs of fatigue, which may be related to his role as caregiver. The living environment in Kuhmoinenv√§in 5B was described as comfortable yet isolated due to the elderly nature of Irmeli.

Notable concerns included the physical proximity between Ari and his grandmother, which could potentially strain relationships. Emotional state observations indicated that Irmeli was managing her condition adequately but expressed a need for more social interaction to maintain her well-being.

### **Assessment**

Given the case severity is low, the situation appears manageable with some minor adjustments. The family dynamics are stable, and the youth mentoring program is functioning effectively. However, Ari's physical exhaustion may require additional support in managing his caregiving role.

No immediate risks were identified, but ongoing monitoring of Irmeli's condition and increased social engagement for her are recommended to enhance her quality of life.

### **Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. **Follow-up Visits:** Schedule periodic check-ins with Ari to monitor his well-being and the impact on his grandmother.
2. **Program Review:** Conduct a follow-up assessment of the youth mentoring program to ensure continued effectiveness.
3. **Social Services Referral:** Consider referring Irmeli Lehto to social services for additional support in managing her dementia, if needed.
