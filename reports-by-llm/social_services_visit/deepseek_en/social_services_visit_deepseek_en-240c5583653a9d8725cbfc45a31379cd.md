### Summary of Visit Purpose  
The purpose of this visit was to conduct a domestic violence risk assessment for an elderly woman with early dementia symptoms. The primary goal was to evaluate the current situation and assess any potential risks related to domestic violence in her household.

### Observations During the Visit  
Upon arrival at Ms. Maria Andersson's residence, it was evident that she is an elderly individual experiencing cognitive decline due to early dementia. Her living environment appears modest, with limited mobility and no visible assistance aids. During the visit, no previous incidents of domestic violence were observed. However, Ms. Andersson exhibited signs of emotional distress, which warranted further investigation.

### Assessment  
Given the high severity of the case, several concerns were identified:  
1. **Emotional Distress:** Ms. Andersson's dementia may exacerbate emotional instability, potentially leading to increased aggression or withdrawal.
2. **Living Conditions:** The home appears structurally sound but lacks necessary safety features for an elderly individual with mobility challenges.
3. **Cognitive Impairment:** Her early dementia symptoms suggest difficulty in managing personal care and recognizing potential risks.

### Recommended Actions or Follow-up  
1. **Immediate Action:** Contact social services to initiate further risk assessment measures, including a detailed review of her medical history and living environment.
2. **Support Services:** Arrange for assistance with medication management and emotional support to aid Ms. Andersson in managing her condition.
3. **Monitoring:** Schedule follow-up visits within 14 days to reassess her situation and ensure ongoing safety.

This report underscores the need for comprehensive intervention to address both her health and safety concerns effectively.
