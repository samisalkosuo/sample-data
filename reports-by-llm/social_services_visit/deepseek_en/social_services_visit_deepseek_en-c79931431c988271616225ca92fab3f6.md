**Case Severity:** Low  

---

### Summary of Visit Purpose  
The purpose of this visit was to evaluate the parental capacity of the mother in her role as a primary caregiver for her two children under 10. Given the family's refugee status and their temporary accommodation, it is crucial to assess their ability to meet the children's immediate needs while they seek more stable living conditions.

### Observations During the Visit  
During the visit, the mother appeared weary but remained optimistic about her situation. She expressed efforts to manage daily tasks with the support of social services. The home environment was basic, lacking essential resources for optimal care. Concerns were noted regarding the family's temporary accommodation and its impact on the children's well-being.

### Assessment  
The current situation involves a mother who is actively seeking assistance but faces challenges due to limited resources in temporary housing. The low case severity indicates that immediate harm risks are minimal, yet long-term instability poses concerns about child welfare. The father has not assumed primary caregiving responsibilities, which may affect the children's well-being.

### Recommended Actions or Follow-up  
1. **Immediate Support:** Provide additional resources and support to the mother and children to enhance their living conditions.
2. **Safety Measures:** Ensure the children's safety in the temporary environment and consider referrals to child protection services if necessary.
3. **Stability Efforts:** Encourage the family to pursue more stable housing through social services.
4. **Follow-up Visits:** Schedule regular check-ins to monitor progress and address any emerging issues.
