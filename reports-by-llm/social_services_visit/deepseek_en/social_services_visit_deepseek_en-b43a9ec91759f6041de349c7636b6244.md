### Observations During the Visit  
The client, Anna Maria Kivipelto, appeared cooperative during the visit but reported being exhausted due to ongoing substance use. The living environment was clean and organized, with no immediate signs of neglect or abuse. However, the parent expressed concerns about their ability to provide consistent supervision for their children in the coming weeks. There were also subtle indicators of emotional fatigue that could impact the children's well-being.

### Assessment  
The situation appears to be stable with minimal risks due to low case severity. The living conditions are satisfactory, and the parent demonstrates a willingness to supervise their children. However, ongoing substance use poses a potential barrier to effective supervision in the short term. Long-term support may be necessary if the parent continues to struggle with substance use.
