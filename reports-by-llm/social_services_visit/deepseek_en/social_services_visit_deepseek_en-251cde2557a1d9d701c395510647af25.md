### **Observations During the Visit**

During the visit, Ms. Kivipelto interacted with staff at Taipalsaari Retirement Home, where she resides. Her interactions were moderate, showing some withdrawal but maintaining engagement in light activities. She displayed signs of anxiety, which was noted as a concern. 

Her living environment is quiet and well-maintained, contributing to her emotional stability. However, adherence to prescribed medications remained inconsistent, prompting further investigation into possible barriers affecting her health.

### **Assessment**

Ms. Kivipelto's integration efforts are limited but not entirely absent. Her support network appears strong, with family involvement noted in previous communications. The moderate severity indicates that while she is capable of some independent activities, significant social isolation remains a risk.

Emotional well-being was generally stable, though occasional anxiety episodes were observed. Daily functioning suggests she can manage basic tasks independently but may require ongoing support to maintain quality of life.

2. **Community Resource Exploration:** Identify additional resources for potential isolation prevention, including local senior centers or community groups.
3. **Monitoring Health:** Regularly check medication adherence and monitor any emerging health concerns related to dementia symptoms.
4. **Ongoing Assessment:** Schedule a follow-up assessment in six months to evaluate progress in reintegration efforts.
