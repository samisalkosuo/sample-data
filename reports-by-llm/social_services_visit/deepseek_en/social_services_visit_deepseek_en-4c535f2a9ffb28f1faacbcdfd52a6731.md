### Assessment  
The family's moderate case severity indicates that while they have some support in place, there is room for improvement in structuring their daily routines and managing time effectively. The couple demonstrates a positive attitude but could benefit from more organized planning to address the challenges posed by their child's condition.  

**Risks:**  
- Potential strain on family dynamics due to increased responsibilities.  
- Need for additional support services if time management issues persist.

**Family Dynamics:**  
The couple maintains good communication within the household, with both parents actively participating in decision-making processes. Their proactive use of local resources is commendable but could be further enhanced with structured planning tools or workshops on parenting strategies.
