### Observations During the Visit  
The woman, Mrs. Anna Lehto (30 years old), appeared cooperative and in good spirits during the visit. Her home was clean and well-organized, with a functional layout for daily activities. She expressed satisfaction with her living situation but mentioned that her room feels cramped due to limited storage space. Additionally, she noted that the noise from the baby's cot can sometimes disrupt her sleep.

Mr. Olli Lehto (28 years old), the father, was supportive and cooperative. He did not bring up any concerns during the visit. The couple seemed well-adjusted and appeared to be in a positive emotional state overall.

### Assessment  
The family is categorized as low risk due to their stable living conditions and positive interactions with social services staff. However, minor concerns related to space and noise from the baby were noted. These factors could potentially affect the mother's stress levels when caring for her child alone. The couple appears to be well-suited to raising a child together.

### Recommended Actions or Follow-up  
A follow-up visit is scheduled in three months to reassess the family's well-being, particularly focusing on any long-term effects of noise from the baby on Mrs. Lehto's stress levels. If no significant changes are observed, social services will continue to monitor the situation. Support services remain available if needed.

This report reflects a positive outlook for the couple while addressing minor concerns that could impact their child welfare in the short term.
