### Summary of Visit Purpose

The purpose of this visit was to conduct a Disability Support Assessment for Anna Lehto, whose elderly parent is caring for grandchildren. The assessment aimed to evaluate the adequacy of support provided and ensure compliance with disability benefit standards.

### Observations During the Visit

During the visit, interactions indicated that the living environment was comfortable but slightly outdated. Grandchildren appeared engaged in activities, suggesting a positive dynamic. However, concerns were noted regarding potential neglect in specific areas due to limited supervision. The family seemed aware of their responsibilities but expressed a need for additional support.

### Assessment

The current situation is manageable with appropriate support. Key risks include potential neglect if supervision isn't enhanced. Family dynamics are generally stable, though further evaluation may be needed to ensure all grandchildren's needs are met.

### Recommended Actions or Follow-up

- **Additional Support:** Introduce enhanced supervision in potentially neglected areas.
- **Follow-up Visits:** Schedule periodic checks to monitor support levels and grandchildren's well-being.
- **Referrals:** Consider referring to social services for ongoing evaluation if concerns persist.
