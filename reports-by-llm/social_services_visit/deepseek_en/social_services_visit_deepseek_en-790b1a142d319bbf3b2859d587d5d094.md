### **Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted as part of the ongoing assessment for a child who had been discharged from a hospital following an accident involving severe injuries. The purpose of this post-hospital discharge visit is to evaluate the child's immediate well-being, assess their living environment, and understand the dynamics within the family system. Given the urgent nature of the case, this visit aims to identify any potential risks or concerns that may impact the child's recovery and long-term stability.

### **Observations During the Visit**

During the visit, several key observations were made:  

1. **Child's Condition**: The child appeared fatigued but showed signs of improvement since their hospital discharge. However, they expressed difficulty sleeping at night, indicating ongoing physical discomfort or emotional distress.  

2. **Living Situation**: The child was residing with a non-custodial relative who is currently employed as a part-time domestic worker. While the living conditions were deemed safe and hygienic, there were concerns about the level of support provided by the relative in terms of childcare and emotional involvement.  

3. **Parental Behavior**: One parent reported that they had been attending therapy sessions for stress management but had not yet sought help for their own mental health. The other parent was less cooperative, showing signs of frustration with the situation and indicating limited involvement in the child's care beyond providing basic support.  

4. **Emotional State**: Both parents exhibited varying levels of concern regarding the child's well-being. The non-custodial relative appeared to be primarily focused on managing daily tasks but seemed unaware of the child's emotional state, while one parent expressed feelings of abandonment and controllessness.  

5. **Notable Concerns**: There were concerns about the long-term impact of the accident on the child's development and potential difficulties in obtaining appropriate support from the non-custodial relative. Additionally, there was a need to ensure that both parents receive adequate mental health support to maintain their roles as caregivers.

### **Assessment**

The assessment indicates that while the child is making some progress post-hospital discharge, several risks exist:  

1. **Child's Recovery**: The child may experience ongoing physical discomfort or emotional distress, which could hinder their recovery process and affect their ability to thrive in the current environment.  

2. **Family Dynamics**: The involvement of both parents in the child's care is uneven, with one parent actively seeking support while the other appears to be isolated. This imbalance could lead to further stress for the child and potential conflicts within the family system.  

3. **Support Availability**: The non-custodial relative may not provide sufficient level of care or emotional involvement, raising concerns about the child's long-term well-being. Additionally, there is a risk that neither parent has fully engaged in support services required to address their mental health needs.  

4. **Risk Factors**: The combination of the child's physical condition and family dynamics increases the likelihood of further complications, such as prolonged emotional distress or potential neglect if not addressed promptly.

### **Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

To mitigate the identified risks and ensure the child's well-being, the following actions are recommended:  

1. **Therapy for Parents**: Both parents should be referred to counseling services to address their stress-related issues and improve their mental health. This will help them better support the child in the long term.  

2. **Stress Management Plan**: The non-custodial relative should be encouraged to implement a structured daily routine that includes childcare responsibilities, ensuring the child's safety and well-being.  

3. **Social Services Intervention**: Given the urgent nature of the case, further assessment may be required to determine if additional support services or protective measures are necessary for the child.  

4. **Support Groups**: Facilitating informal support groups among the parents could foster better collaboration and provide a platform for sharing experiences and strategies to manage their roles effectively.  

5. **Follow-up Visit**: A follow-up visit within 30 days is scheduled to monitor the child's progress, assess any changes in family dynamics, and ensure that all recommended actions have been implemented.
