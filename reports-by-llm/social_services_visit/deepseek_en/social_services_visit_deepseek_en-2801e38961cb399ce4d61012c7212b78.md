### Observations During the Visit  
Upon arriving at her residence on Polkakatu 45, it was evident that she was in a vulnerable state. She appeared overwhelmed with tears, indicating significant distress from both the abuse and her long-term neglect. Her behavior was disoriented and anxious; she struggled to locate essential items such as keys or a mobile phone, suggesting she may not be able to care for herself independently. The living conditions were dire: the home was dirty, cold, and lacked furniture, with no apparent attempt to maintain basic hygiene or comfort. While she appeared exhausted, her willingness to engage upon support indicated that she needed immediate assistance.

### Assessment  
The individual's mental health is deteriorating rapidly due to the trauma of domestic abuse and prolonged neglect. Her physical state reflects the impact of these events on her well-being. The family dynamics are strained, with no apparent support from others. Given her inability to care for herself, her situation is deemed critical. There is a high risk of further harm or domestic violence, as she lacks the capacity to manage such situations independently. Immediate intervention is necessary to stabilize her and prevent escalation.

### Recommended Actions or Follow-up  
1. **Immediate Referral**: The individual should be referred to emergency services (e.g., local police) for protection from harm and potential intervention in the home.  
2. **Social Services Intervention**: Contact social services for long-term support, case management, and stabilization measures. This includes exploring multi-agency collaboration to address her needs comprehensively.  
3. **Home-Stay Services**: Consider placement in a temporary supportive housing arrangement to provide immediate stability while she undergoes further evaluation and care.
