### **Assessment**

The assessment indicates that while the family is relatively stable in terms of living conditions, there are significant risks associated with their current state. The high case severity is justified by factors such as:

- **Financial Stress:** Ongoing expenses related to their living situation may impact the parents' ability to provide a stable environment for their children.
  
- **Family Dynamics:** Strained relationships between the parents could lead to further emotional distress for the children and potential conflicts within the family.

- **Lack of Support Network:** The absence of strong support networks, particularly among the parents, increases the risk of further stress and instability.

2. **Parental Support:** Provide additional support for both parents, including counseling or access to financial assistance programs, to help them manage stress and improve family dynamics.

3. **Child Emotional Support:** Arrange for extended parental leave or additional educational support for the children to help them cope with the emotional strain caused by their parents' conflicts.

4. **Regular Follow-up Visits:** Schedule periodic visits (e.g., monthly) to monitor progress toward reunification and address any emerging concerns.
