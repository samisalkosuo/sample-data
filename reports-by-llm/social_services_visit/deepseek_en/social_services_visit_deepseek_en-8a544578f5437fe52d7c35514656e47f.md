### Summary of Visit Purpose

This assessment aims to evaluate the child's ability to adapt to community integration, identify any barriers or risks that may impede their adjustment, and ensure access to necessary support services.

### Observations During the Visit  
During the visit, several key observations were made:  

1. **Mother's Emotional State**: The mother appeared stressed and overwhelmed, frequently expressing concerns about her ability to provide adequate care for the child. She seemed disconnected from daily routines and interactions with other family members.  

2. **Living Conditions**: The home was clean but lacked essential items such as a cot or feeding equipment. The absence of these could hinder the child's development and comfort.  

3. **Child's Behavior**: The infant exhibited signs of separation anxiety, remaining in her crib during the visit despite being placed outside for feeding. This may indicate ongoing stress from the mother's emotional state.  

4. **Community Access**: Limited access to social services was noted, with no local support groups or healthcare providers available to assist the family.

### Assessment  
The assessment reveals a high severity of risk due to the child's potential difficulty in integrating into Brändö. Key findings include:  

- **Emotional and Caregiving Strain**: The mother's stress may impact the child's emotional well-being, necessitating additional support services such as counseling or parenting classes.  
- **Lack of Community Resources**: The absence of readily available social services could delay the child's development and require targeted interventions to address these barriers.

### Recommended Actions or Follow-up  
To address the high severity case, the following actions are recommended:  

1. **Social Work Assessment**: Conduct a comprehensive assessment to identify specific risks and determine appropriate support services for both the mother and child.  
2. **Referral to Support Services**: Referral to local social work agencies for specialized counseling and parenting support tailored to the family's needs.  
3. **Community Involvement**: Engage with local community organizations to establish a support network, including access to healthcare, educational resources, and social activities for children.  
4. **Timeline for Follow-up**: Schedule a follow-up visit within 30 days to monitor progress and adjust interventions as needed.
