### **Observations During the Visit**

During the visit, Anna Maria was observed in a shared apartment with another adult. Her presence indicated that she had recently moved into the property. She appeared emotionally stabilized but still vulnerable due to ongoing stress from domestic abuse. The living conditions were modest, with limited personal belongings and potential exposure to cold temperatures typical for early July.

Anna Maria seemed focused on her recovery efforts, actively seeking help and support. However, there were concerns about her living situation's safety and the risk of re-abuse or isolation if she were to relapse. No immediate threats were identified, but the instability in her previous home is a significant factor in assessing her current stability.
