### Summary of Visit Purpose  
The purpose of this visit was to assess the compliance of a juvenile with their probation terms as part of a juvenile probation compliance visit. The visit aimed to evaluate the child's progress in attending therapy sessions, maintaining family contact, and adhering to specified rules. Given the moderate case severity, the focus was on identifying any barriers impacting the child's well-being and ensuring timely intervention.

### Observations During the Visit  
The visit took place at Mrs. Sari Lehto's home in Rääkkylä, where she resides with her 14-year-old daughter, Emma. Mrs. Lehto expressed concerns about Emma's compliance due to limited English proficiency and challenges with schoolwork. The child appeared cooperative but showed signs of stress from the temporary accommodation environment.

Living conditions were modest yet safe, with basic amenities available. Emotional well-being was mixed; Emma seemed focused on school but exhibited signs of loneliness. Mrs. Lehto highlighted concerns about her daughter's academic progress due to language barriers and potential stressors in the temporary setting.

### Assessment  
The assessment revealed moderate case severity. Emma demonstrated limited English skills, which may hinder her academic performance. She expressed difficulty with homework and appeared overwhelmed by the instability of her living situation. Mrs. Lehto reported concerns about her daughter's ability to maintain school progress and overall well-being due to these factors. Additionally, potential underlying issues such as anxiety or depression were noted.

### Recommended Actions or Follow-up  
1. **Review Therapy Compliance:** Schedule a follow-up session with Emma to assess her progress in therapy sessions.
2. **Language Support:** Provide additional English language instruction if needed to aid academic success.
3. **Stress and Safety Review:** Ensure the family has access to resources addressing stress and safety concerns related to temporary accommodation.
