### **Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival, Anna Maria appeared anxious but cooperative. She provided limited information about her background, indicating she has been in foster care for several years. Her living situation was dire: inadequate sleeping arrangements and no access to basic kitchen facilities. She expressed feelings of loneliness and stated that she had only a few basic skills, including limited English proficiency.

### **Assessment**

Anna Maria's moderate case severity indicates she is at risk due to isolation and lack of support networks. Her absence from her biological parents' home suggests strained family dynamics. Immediate actions are required to secure emergency accommodation while reintegration planning with the foster care system continues. Additional mental health services may be necessary to address her emotional challenges.
