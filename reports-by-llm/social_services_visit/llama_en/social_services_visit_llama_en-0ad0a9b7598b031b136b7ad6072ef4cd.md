Social Services Visit Report

Date: 19 December 2024
Location: Ruovesi, Finland
Visit Type: Support Plan Review Meeting

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to review the support plan for the family of four residing at address 123 Kylpylaanen, Ruovesi. The case has been classified as high severity due to concerns regarding the well-being and safety of the children within the household.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival, I observed a warm but somewhat tense atmosphere within the home. The parents, Mr. and Mrs. Lehtonen, were present during my visit, along with their four children aged 6, 8, 10, and 12 years. The living conditions appeared to be satisfactory, with clean and well-maintained furniture and appliances. However, there was a noticeable lack of personal space and clutter in certain areas.

During our conversation, Mr. Lehtonen expressed concerns about the increasing financial burden on his family due to job losses in the local forestry industry. Mrs. Lehtonen reported feeling overwhelmed by the responsibilities of caring for their children while managing the household. The children seemed hesitant to discuss their feelings or emotions, suggesting a possible lack of trust in adult figures.

Assessment:
The assessment indicates that this family is facing significant challenges, including financial instability and emotional strain. The parents' relationship appears strained, with Mr. Lehtonen's job losses exacerbating tensions. The children are likely experiencing anxiety and stress due to their parents' situation. Given the high severity of the case, it is essential to provide immediate support and guidance to prevent further deterioration.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Referral to local employment services: I will arrange for Mr. Lehtonen to receive assistance with job searching and resume building.
2. Family counseling sessions: Regular counseling sessions will be scheduled for both parents and children to address emotional issues and improve communication.
3. Financial assistance: The family will be eligible for temporary financial support from the local social services department to help alleviate some of the burden.
4. Home safety assessment: A home safety assessment will be conducted to identify potential hazards and provide recommendations for improvement.

Timeline:

* Follow-up visit: 15 January 2025, to assess progress and adjust the support plan as needed.
* Employment services meeting: 22 January 2025, to discuss job opportunities and career development.
* Family counseling sessions: Bi-weekly sessions will commence on 29 January 2025, with a total of six sessions scheduled.

Conclusion:
This visit has highlighted the need for comprehensive support to address the complex issues faced by this family. By providing employment assistance, family counseling, financial support, and home safety improvements, we can work towards improving their overall well-being and stability.
