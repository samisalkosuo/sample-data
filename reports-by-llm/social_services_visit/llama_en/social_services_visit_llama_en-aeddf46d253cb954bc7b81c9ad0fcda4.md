Social Services Visit Report

Date: 24 April 2025
Location: Enonteki√∂, Finland
Visit Type: Post-hospital discharge visit

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this post-hospital discharge visit was to assess the well-being of the family following the infant's hospitalization. The teenage mother and her parents are receiving support from social services to ensure a safe and stable environment for the child.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival, I met with the teenage mother, Ms. Aino Luukkainen (age 19), and her parents, Mr. Pekka Luukkainen (age 52) and Mrs. Marja-Liisa Luukkainen (age 50). The infant, a six-month-old boy named Elias, was present during the visit.

Ms. Luukkainen reported that she had been experiencing anxiety and stress since the hospitalization, which led to some difficulties in caring for Elias. Her parents have been providing emotional support and helping with daily tasks such as feeding and changing diapers. However, they expressed concerns about their daughter's mental health and ability to care for herself.

The living conditions at the family home were found to be satisfactory, with adequate space for the three individuals. The kitchen was clean, and the bathroom was well-maintained. However, there were some signs of clutter and disorganization in the living areas.

During the visit, I observed that Ms. Luukkainen seemed overwhelmed and tearful at times, while her parents appeared concerned but supportive. Elias was happy and content, but his crying episodes increased during the visit, which may be related to the stress experienced by his mother.

Assessment:
The situation appears to be moderate in terms of case severity. While there are some concerns about Ms. Luukkainen's mental health and ability to care for herself, her parents' support has helped mitigate these risks. However, it is essential to continue monitoring the family's well-being and provide ongoing support to ensure a stable environment for Elias.

Family dynamics:
The relationship between Ms. Luukkainen and her parents appears to be positive, with both parties showing concern and empathy towards each other. However, there may be some power imbalances in their interactions, which could impact Ms. Luukkainen's autonomy and decision-making capacity.

Notable concerns:

* Ms. Luukkainen's mental health: It is essential to monitor her anxiety and stress levels and provide access to counseling services if necessary.
* Elias's care: While his parents are providing support, it is crucial to ensure that Ms. Luukkainen receives adequate training and resources to care for herself and her infant.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Ongoing counseling sessions for Ms. Luukkainen to address her anxiety and stress levels.
2. Referral to a parenting class or support group to help Ms. Luukkainen develop skills and confidence in caring for Elias.
3. Regular home visits to monitor the family's well-being and provide additional support as needed.
4. Follow-up appointments with Ms. Luukkainen every two weeks to assess her mental health and adjust the support plan accordingly.

Timeline:

* Next follow-up visit: 8 May 2025
* Review of counseling sessions: 15 June 2025
