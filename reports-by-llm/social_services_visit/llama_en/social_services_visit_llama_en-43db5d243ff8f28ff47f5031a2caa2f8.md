Social Services Visit Report

Date: 22 June 2025
Location: Soini, Finland
Visit Type: Juvenile Probation Compliance Visit

Summary of Visit Purpose:
This visit was conducted to assess the compliance of 17-year-old client, Aino Virtanen, with the conditions set forth in her juvenile probation order. The case severity is urgent due to concerns regarding Aino's well-being and safety following a recent incident involving substance use.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival at the address, 123 Soininkuja, Soini, Finland (Aino's residence), I was greeted by Aino's live-in caregiver, Ms. Leena Kärkkäinen. The living conditions were satisfactory, with a focus on maintaining a clean and hygienic environment for both Aino and Ms. Kärkkäinen. However, there were signs of disorganization in the kitchen area, which may pose a risk to food safety.

During our conversation, Aino appeared anxious and hesitant to discuss her recent activities. She mentioned that she had been struggling with stress related to school and social pressures. I observed that Ms. Kärkkäinen was supportive but also seemed overwhelmed by the responsibilities of caring for Aino.

Assessment:
The situation appears to be complex, with Aino facing significant challenges in managing her daily life, emotional well-being, and academic performance. The urgent case severity is justified due to concerns about Aino's safety and potential risks associated with substance use. It is essential to address these issues promptly to prevent further escalation.

Family dynamics:
The relationship between Aino and Ms. Kärkkäinen appears to be supportive, but there are signs of burnout among the caregiver. I recommended that we explore alternative support options for Ms. Kärkkäinen, such as respite care or counseling services, to ensure her well-being and ability to provide adequate care.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Referral to a local youth counselor for individual therapy sessions to address Aino's stress and emotional well-being.
2. Collaboration with the school administration to develop a personalized support plan for Aino, including academic accommodations and social skills training.
3. Arrangement of respite care services for Ms. Kärkkäinen to ensure her well-being and ability to provide adequate care for Aino.
4. Follow-up visit in two weeks to assess progress, address any concerns, and adjust the support plan as needed.

Timeline:

* 22 June 2025: Initial compliance visit
* 6 July 2025: First follow-up visit to assess progress and adjust support plan
* 20 July 2025: Second follow-up visit to evaluate Aino's well-being and safety
