**Social Services Visit Report**

**Visit Date:** 12.08.2024
**Location:** Säkylä, Finland
**Visit Type:** Post-abuse recovery support visit
**Household Composition:** Young adult living alone
**Case Severity:** High

**Summary of Visit Purpose:**
The purpose of this visit was to provide post-abuse recovery support to a young adult who has experienced abuse in the past. The visit aimed to assess the individual's current situation, provide emotional support, and identify potential risks or concerns that may require further intervention.

**Observations During the Visit:**

Upon arrival at the address, 34500 Säkylänkatu 12, Säkylä, Finland, I observed a young adult, Ms. Aino Luukkainen (age 22), who appeared anxious and guarded during our initial conversation. She hesitated to discuss her past experiences, but eventually opened up about the abuse she suffered at the hands of her former partner.

Ms. Luukkainen's living conditions were found to be satisfactory, with basic necessities provided for her daily needs. However, I noted some signs of emotional distress, including frequent crying spells and difficulty sleeping. Her belongings were neatly arranged, suggesting a sense of control and stability in her environment.

During our conversation, Ms. Luukkainen expressed feelings of shame, guilt, and anxiety related to the abuse. She reported struggling with nightmares, flashbacks, and intrusive thoughts, which have significantly impacted her daily life. I observed some defensive behaviors, such as becoming overly critical of herself and others, which may be indicative of underlying emotional trauma.

**Assessment:**
Given the high case severity, it is clear that Ms. Luukkainen requires ongoing support to address the emotional and psychological impacts of abuse. The individual's situation poses a risk to her physical and mental well-being, particularly if left unaddressed. I observed some signs of resilience, such as her efforts to maintain a sense of control over her environment, which is encouraging.

However, the presence of anxiety, shame, and guilt suggests that Ms. Luukkainen may benefit from additional support to process her emotions and develop coping strategies. The risk of further trauma or exacerbation of existing symptoms cannot be ruled out without continued monitoring and intervention.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up:**

1. **Referral to counseling services:** I recommend that Ms. Luukkainen receive individualized counseling sessions to address the emotional and psychological impacts of abuse.
2. **Support group participation:** Encouraging her participation in a support group for survivors of abuse may provide a safe space for her to share experiences, connect with others who have gone through similar situations, and develop social skills.
3. **Ongoing monitoring:** Regular follow-up visits will be necessary to assess Ms. Luukkainen's progress, address any emerging concerns, and adjust the support plan as needed.
4. **Collaboration with local authorities:** I suggest that we maintain close communication with local authorities, such as the police and social services, to ensure a coordinated response to Ms. Luukkainen's situation.

**Timeline for Follow-up:**

* Next follow-up visit: 6 weeks from today's date
* Referral to counseling services: within the next 2 weeks
* Support group participation: arranged through local organizations specializing in abuse support

By providing ongoing support and addressing the identified risks, we can help Ms. Luukkainen recover from her experiences and rebuild a more stable, fulfilling life.
