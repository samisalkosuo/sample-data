Social Services Visit Report

Date: 23.03.2025
Location: Riihimäki, Finland
Visit Type: Immigration case monitoring visit

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to monitor the well-being of Mr. Juhani Lehtonen, an elderly Finnish citizen residing in Riihimäki with his adult daughter, Ms. Maria Lehtonen. The immigration case was initiated due to concerns about Mr. Lehtonen's potential deportation to his home country of Estonia, which he had not visited for over 20 years.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival at the residence, I observed a warm and welcoming environment. Mr. Lehtonen, 75, greeted me with a smile and invited me in. His daughter, Maria, 42, was present during our conversation. The living conditions were clean and tidy, with no signs of neglect or abuse. However, I noted that the household had limited access to outdoor spaces, which might contribute to Mr. Lehtonen's feelings of isolation.

During our conversation, Mr. Lehtonen expressed his concerns about being deported back to Estonia, citing difficulties in finding employment and accessing healthcare services. Maria assured me that she would do everything possible to support her father during this challenging time. I observed a strong bond between the two family members, with Maria taking on a caregiver role.

Assessment:
Given the low case severity, it appears that Mr. Lehtonen is currently receiving adequate care and support from his daughter. However, the potential deportation threat may still pose risks to his mental health and well-being. I recommend continued monitoring of the situation to ensure that Mr. Lehtonen's needs are being met.

Family dynamics:
The relationship between Mr. Lehtonen and Maria appears to be positive and supportive. Maria's role as a caregiver is evident, but it is also clear that she values her own independence and autonomy. I suggest exploring options for respite care or adult day services to alleviate some of the caregiving burden on Maria.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Schedule regular check-ins with Mr. Lehtonen to monitor his well-being and provide emotional support.
2. Explore options for respite care or adult day services to support Maria in her caregiving role.
3. Provide information on local resources, such as counseling services, that may be beneficial for both Mr. Lehtonen and Maria.
4. Schedule a follow-up visit within the next 6-8 weeks to reassess the situation and provide further support if needed.

Next Steps:
The social services team will maintain regular contact with Maria and Mr. Lehtonen to ensure their needs are being met. We will also continue to monitor the immigration case and provide updates on any developments that may impact Mr. Lehtonen's situation.
