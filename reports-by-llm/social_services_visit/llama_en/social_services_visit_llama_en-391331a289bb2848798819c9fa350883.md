Social Services Visit Report

Date: 25 June 2025
Location: Aura, Finland
Visit Type: Post-abuse recovery support visit

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to assess the well-being of a disabled adult and their live-in caregiver in Aura, Finland. The visit aimed to provide post-abuse recovery support, given the history of abuse reported in the case.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival, I met with the disabled adult, Ms. Maria Lehtinen, and her live-in caregiver, Mr. Juhani Kärkkäinen. Both individuals were cooperative during the visit. The living conditions were satisfactory, with a clean and organized home environment. However, there were some signs of stress and anxiety in both Ms. Lehtinen and Mr. Kärkkäinen.

Ms. Lehtinen reported feeling overwhelmed by her daily routine due to her disability, which led to occasional outbursts of frustration. Mr. Kärkkäinen expressed concern about his ability to provide adequate care for Ms. Lehtinen, citing the emotional toll of supporting someone with a history of abuse. Both individuals seemed hesitant to discuss their feelings and emotions in detail.

Notable concerns included the lack of social interaction outside the home, which may exacerbate feelings of isolation and loneliness. The caregiver reported that Mr. Kärkkäinen's own mental health had suffered since taking on the caregiving role, highlighting the need for support services for both individuals.

Assessment:
Given the low case severity, the situation appears to be stable, with no immediate risks to Ms. Lehtinen's safety or well-being. However, ongoing support and resources are necessary to address the emotional and psychological impacts of abuse. The caregiver's mental health requires attention, as does the need for social interaction and community engagement.

Family dynamics:
The relationship between Ms. Lehtinen and Mr. Kärkkäinen appears strained due to the caregiving responsibilities and the history of abuse. While both individuals are cooperative during the visit, it is essential to continue monitoring their emotional state and providing support to prevent further escalation.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Referral to local mental health services for Mr. Kärkkäinen's ongoing care.
2. Arrange a social worker meeting with Ms. Lehtinen to discuss her feelings and develop strategies for managing stress and anxiety.
3. Organize community-based activities and outings to promote social interaction and reduce feelings of isolation.
4. Schedule a follow-up visit in 6 weeks to assess the effectiveness of these interventions.

Timeline:

* 6 weeks: Follow-up visit with Ms. Lehtinen and Mr. Kärkkäinen
* 3 months: Review of progress, adjustments to support services as needed
