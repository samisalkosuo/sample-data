Social Services Visit Report

Visit Date: 16.09.2024
Location: Tohmaj√§rvi, Finland
Visit Type: Foster family evaluation
Case Severity: Low

Summary of Visit Purpose:
This visit was conducted as part of an ongoing foster care evaluation to assess the well-being and safety of the teenager in care at the address provided. The purpose of this visit is to evaluate the living conditions, interactions between the teenager and caregivers, and overall dynamics within the household.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival, I observed a warm and welcoming environment at the address. The teenager, Juhani Laaksonen, was initially hesitant but gradually opened up during our conversation. He reported feeling comfortable with his foster family, who have been providing care since his entry into foster care six months ago.

The living conditions were satisfactory, with clean and well-maintained premises. The foster family demonstrated a good understanding of Juhani's needs and provided adequate support in terms of education, extracurricular activities, and emotional support.

Notable concerns arose during the visit when Juhani expressed feelings of frustration and isolation due to limited social interactions outside of school. He also mentioned occasional conflicts with his foster siblings, which were addressed by the caregivers through open communication and conflict resolution strategies.

Assessment:
Based on the observations and discussions during the visit, it appears that the foster family is providing a stable and supportive environment for Juhani. The case severity remains low due to the absence of significant risks or concerns that would necessitate immediate intervention.

However, it is essential to continue monitoring Juhani's emotional well-being and social interactions to ensure his long-term success in foster care. Regular check-ins with the foster family and Juhani will be necessary to address any emerging issues and provide ongoing support.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Schedule regular check-ins (every 6 weeks) with the foster family and Juhani to monitor his emotional well-being and social interactions.
2. Arrange for additional support services, such as counseling or group therapy, to help Juhani develop social skills and build relationships outside of school.
3. Provide ongoing education and training for the foster family on conflict resolution strategies and supporting teenagers with emotional needs.

Timeline:

* Next visit: 20.11.2024
* Follow-up phone call: 15.10.2024 to discuss Juhani's progress and address any emerging concerns.
