Social Services Visit Report

Date: 10 December 2024
Location: Karijoki, Finland
Visit Type: Unaccompanied Minor Intake Assessment
Case Severity: Moderate

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct an intake assessment for the unaccompanied minor in foster care residing at the address provided. The visit aimed to gather information about the child's current situation, assess potential risks and concerns, and evaluate the need for support services.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival, I met with the teenager, Aki Luukkainen, who is currently living in foster care. Aki appeared anxious and reserved during our initial conversation. However, as we progressed, he opened up about his daily life, interests, and concerns. It became apparent that Aki struggles with social interactions due to past experiences of bullying at school.

The living conditions at the address were satisfactory, with adequate space for Aki's needs. The foster parents provided a warm and welcoming environment, but there were instances where they seemed uncertain about how to manage Aki's behavior. Notable concerns included Aki's frequent mood swings and his tendency to engage in self-destructive behaviors when feeling overwhelmed.

Assessment:
Based on the observations during the visit, it is clear that Aki faces significant challenges in adapting to foster care. The moderate case severity indicates a need for support services to address Aki's emotional well-being and behavioral issues. The foster parents' uncertainty about managing Aki's behavior suggests a need for additional training or guidance.

The household dynamics appeared stable, with the foster parents demonstrating a genuine interest in supporting Aki's needs. However, it is essential to monitor their ability to provide consistent support and address any emerging concerns promptly.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Referral to counseling services: Arrange for Aki to receive individual counseling sessions to address his emotional well-being and develop coping strategies.
2. Foster parent training: Provide the foster parents with additional training on managing challenging behaviors, developing positive relationships with Aki, and addressing potential triggers.
3. Regular progress monitoring: Schedule regular visits (every 6 weeks) to monitor Aki's adjustment to foster care, assess the effectiveness of support services, and make any necessary adjustments to the plan.
4. Family therapy sessions: Consider family therapy sessions to address any underlying issues within the household and promote a more cohesive unit.

Timeline for Follow-up:

* Next visit: 24 January 2025 (6 weeks from the date of this report)
* Follow-up visits will be scheduled as needed, with a maximum interval of 12 weeks between assessments.
