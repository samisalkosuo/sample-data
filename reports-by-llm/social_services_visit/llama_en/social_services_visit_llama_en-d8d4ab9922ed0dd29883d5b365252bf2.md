Social Services Visit Report

Date: 02.10.2024
Location: Puumala, Finland
Visit Type: Child Welfare Check
Case Severity: Moderate

Summary of Visit Purpose:
This visit was conducted as part of an ongoing child welfare check to assess the well-being and safety of a young adult living alone in Puumala. The purpose of this visit is to evaluate the individual's living conditions, interactions with others, and overall emotional state to determine if any concerns or risks warrant further intervention.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival at the address, located on Koulukatu 12, Puumala, I observed a young adult, identified as 22-year-old Emma Lehtonen, who appeared to be living alone in a modest apartment. The premises were clean and well-maintained, with no signs of neglect or abuse. Emma was cooperative during the visit and provided information about her daily routine, social interactions, and any concerns she may have regarding her living situation.

During our conversation, Emma reported feeling isolated and struggling to maintain relationships due to her busy schedule and limited social connections. She also expressed some anxiety about her financial stability and future plans. However, she denied any substance abuse or self-harm behaviors.

Notable Concerns:
While the overall assessment was positive, I did notice that Emma seemed hesitant to discuss certain aspects of her life, such as her family background and relationships with others. This may indicate a need for further support and guidance in building trust and establishing healthy relationships.

Assessment:
Based on this visit, it appears that Emma is facing some challenges related to social isolation and financial stability. However, there are no immediate concerns regarding her safety or well-being. The moderate case severity suggests that ongoing support and monitoring may be necessary to ensure Emma's continued well-being.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Referral to local social services for guidance on building social connections and accessing community resources.
2. Invitation to participate in a financial literacy program to address concerns about her economic stability.
3. Scheduling of future visits to monitor Emma's progress, provide ongoing support, and assess any changes in her situation.

Timeline:
The next visit is scheduled for 03.10.2024, six weeks from the date of this report.
