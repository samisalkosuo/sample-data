Social Services Visit Report

Date: 27 November 2024
Location: Oulu, Finland
Visit Type: Follow-up on school truancy report
Case Severity: Critical

Summary of Visit Purpose:
This visit was conducted to follow up on a recent school truancy report for the family of Ms. Leena Kärkkäinen, residing at address 123 Kauppatorinkatu, Oulu, Finland. The purpose of this visit is to assess the situation and provide support to ensure the well-being and education of her three children.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, I was greeted by Ms. Kärkkäinen, who appeared visibly distressed and anxious. She explained that she had been struggling to balance work and childcare responsibilities, leading to increased stress levels at home. The living conditions were found to be satisfactory, with a clean and well-maintained apartment. However, the family's financial situation was concerning, with limited access to basic necessities.

During our conversation, it became apparent that Ms. Kärkkäinen was struggling to cope with the emotional demands of caring for her children alone. She reported feeling isolated and overwhelmed, with little support from local services or community resources. The children, aged 8, 10, and 12, seemed withdrawn and anxious, displaying signs of behavioral problems.

Assessment:
The situation is critical due to the family's precarious financial situation, lack of social support, and escalating emotional distress. Ms. Kärkkäinen's ability to provide for her children's basic needs is compromised, putting their well-being at risk. The school truancy report highlights a significant concern that requires immediate attention.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Immediate Referral: Ms. Kärkkäinen will be referred to the Oulu Social Services' Crisis Intervention Team for emergency assistance and support.
2. Financial Assistance: An application will be submitted on her behalf for financial aid from the Finnish government's social welfare program, ensuring access to basic necessities such as food, clothing, and healthcare.
3. Counseling Services: The family will be connected with a local counseling service specializing in single-parent households and emotional distress.
4. Education Support: A meeting will be arranged between Ms. Kärkkäinen and the school administration to discuss strategies for supporting her children's education and addressing the underlying causes of truancy.
5. Follow-up Visits: Regular follow-up visits will be scheduled every two weeks to monitor progress, provide ongoing support, and adjust recommendations as necessary.

Timeline:
- Immediate referral and financial assistance application
- Counseling services initiation within 48 hours
- Education support meeting with school administration within 7 days
- First follow-up visit scheduled for 14 November 2024
