Social Services Visit Report

Date: 06.02.2025
Location: Mynämäki, Finland
Visit Type: Child Visitation Supervision Report

Summary of Visit Purpose:
This visit was conducted as part of an ongoing child visitation supervision report to assess the well-being and safety of the child in a single-parent household with a physical disability. The case severity is high due to concerns regarding the adult's ability to provide adequate care and support for the child.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival, I observed that the single adult, Ms. Leena Kärkkäinen, was struggling to perform daily tasks due to her physical disability. She required assistance with basic needs such as cooking, cleaning, and personal hygiene. The living conditions were generally clean and tidy, but there were signs of clutter and disorganization in certain areas.

During the interaction with Ms. Kärkkäinen, I noticed that she was anxious and stressed, which may be contributing to her physical disability. She reported feeling overwhelmed by the responsibilities of caring for a child alone and expressed concerns about her ability to provide a stable and secure environment.

The child, a 7-year-old boy named Elias, seemed to be adjusting well to his current living situation. He was friendly and cooperative during our interactions, but appeared to be struggling with some emotional regulation issues. He exhibited occasional outbursts of anger and frustration, which may be related to the stress and anxiety experienced by Ms. Kärkkäinen.

Assessment:
Based on my observations and assessment, I conclude that the situation is indeed high-risk due to the adult's physical disability and the child's emotional well-being. The lack of support systems and resources for both Ms. Kärkkäinen and Elias may exacerbate these issues if not addressed promptly.

Family dynamics appear strained, with Ms. Kärkkäinen feeling isolated and unsupported. Elias seems to be taking on a caretaking role, which may be contributing to his emotional distress. It is essential that we provide Ms. Kärkkäinen with access to necessary support services, including home care assistance, counseling, and respite care.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Immediate referral for home care assistance to alleviate Ms. Kärkkäinen's physical burden.
2. Arrangement of regular counseling sessions for both Ms. Kärkkäinen and Elias to address emotional well-being and stress management.
3. Coordination with local schools to ensure Elias receives necessary support and accommodations in his educational setting.
4. Follow-up visit within two weeks to assess the effectiveness of recommended actions and provide further guidance as needed.

Timeline:

* Within 48 hours: Arrange home care assistance for Ms. Kärkkäinen.
* Within one week: Schedule initial counseling sessions for both Ms. Kärkkäinen and Elias.
* Two weeks from today: Follow-up visit to assess progress and adjust recommendations as necessary.
