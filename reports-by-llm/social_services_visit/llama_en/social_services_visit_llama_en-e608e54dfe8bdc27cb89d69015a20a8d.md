Social Services Visit Report

Date: 19 February 2025
Location: Nousiainen, Finland
Visit Type: Child visitation supervision report

Summary of Visit Purpose:
This visit was conducted as part of an ongoing child visitation supervision program for a family with a history of chronic domestic violence. The purpose of the visit was to assess the current living situation and interactions between the parents and children, ensuring the safety and well-being of the minor(s) involved.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival at the residence, I observed that the household was tidy, but there were signs of recent cleaning efforts, suggesting an attempt to maintain a sense of normalcy. The family members greeted me warmly, although their interactions seemed somewhat strained. The parents, Juhani and Sari, appeared anxious and on edge, frequently glancing at each other with a mix of tension and concern.

During the conversation, I noted that the children, Linn√©a (8) and Elias (5), seemed hesitant to engage in discussions about their daily lives, often diverting attention to their toys or activities. The parents explained that they had been experiencing increased stress due to the ongoing domestic violence situation, which has led to a decrease in their ability to provide a stable and nurturing environment for their children.

As we spoke, I observed that Juhani and Sari would occasionally raise their voices, although these outbursts were brief and quickly followed by apologetic glances at each other. The children seemed to be aware of the tension and would often seek comfort from me or engage in play to avoid confrontation.

Assessment:
Based on my observations, I assess the situation as moderate in terms of risk. While the family is making efforts to maintain a sense of normalcy, the ongoing domestic violence has created an environment that is emotionally challenging for all parties involved. The children's behavior and emotional state suggest that they are struggling to cope with the stress and uncertainty.

However, it is essential to note that Juhani and Sari have expressed a desire to work towards healing and rebuilding their relationship, which could potentially mitigate some of the risks associated with this situation. I recommend continued support and monitoring to ensure the family's safety and well-being.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Referral to local domestic violence support services for Juhani and Sari, including counseling and advocacy.
2. Continued child visitation supervision to monitor the children's emotional state and adjust the frequency of visits as needed.
3. Collaboration with local social services to explore options for temporary housing or respite care if necessary.
4. Regular check-ins with Juhani and Sari to assess their progress, provide support, and address any concerns.
