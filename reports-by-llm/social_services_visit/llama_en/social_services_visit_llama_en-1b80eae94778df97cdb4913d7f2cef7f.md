**Social Services Visit Report**

**Visit Date:** 25 May 2025
**Location:** Paltamo, Finland
**Visit Type:** Elderly care follow-up
**Household Composition:** Rehabilitated ex-offender reintegrating into society
**Case Severity:** High

**Summary of Visit Purpose:**
The purpose of this visit was to conduct a follow-up assessment on the elderly care needs of Mr. Juhani Kärkkäinen, a rehabilitated ex-offender who is reintegrating into society in Paltamo, Finland. The visit aimed to evaluate the current living conditions, assess any changes or concerns since the last visit, and provide support to ensure his continued well-being.

**Observations During the Visit:**
Upon arrival at Mr. Kärkkäinen's residence, I observed that he was cooperative and welcoming during our conversation. He reported feeling generally satisfied with his living arrangements, although expressed some difficulties in adapting to the local community due to his past experiences. The home environment appeared clean and well-maintained, with minimal signs of disorganization or neglect.

During our discussion, Mr. Kärkkäinen shared concerns about social isolation and difficulty finding employment opportunities that match his skills. He also mentioned feeling anxious about potential reoffending due to the stigma associated with his past conviction. I observed that he was struggling to connect with local community resources and services, which may be exacerbating his feelings of isolation.

**Assessment:**
The assessment indicates a high level of risk for Mr. Kärkkäinen's mental health and well-being due to his history of rehabilitation and reoffending. The current living situation appears stable, but the individual's emotional state is fragile, and he requires ongoing support to address social isolation and employment concerns.

Family dynamics were not observed during this visit, as Mr. Kärkkäinen lives alone. However, it was noted that he has a limited network of acquaintances in the local community, which may be contributing to his feelings of loneliness.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up:**
Based on the assessment, I recommend the following:

1. **Employment Support:** Arrange for Mr. Kärkkäinen to meet with a vocational counselor to explore employment opportunities that match his skills and interests.
2. **Social Isolation Reduction:** Connect him with local community groups and organizations that cater to individuals with similar experiences and interests.
3. **Mental Health Services:** Schedule regular follow-up appointments with a mental health professional to monitor Mr. Kärkkäinen's emotional state and provide ongoing support.
4. **Case Management:** Continue to monitor the individual's progress, adjusting the support plan as needed to address emerging concerns or challenges.

**Timeline for Further Visits:**
The next visit is scheduled for 15 June 2025, with a follow-up assessment in three months (30 September 2025) to evaluate Mr. Kärkkäinen's continued progress and adjust the support plan accordingly.
