Social Services Visit Report

Date: 29 January 2025
Location: Siikalatva, Finland
Visit Type: Refugee Integration Support Visit

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to assess the well-being and integration needs of a refugee family residing in Siikalatva. The mother and her newborn infant were identified as being in need of support during their transition to life in Finland.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival, I met with Mrs. Aino Kauriala, a 28-year-old Syrian refugee, at her residence located at Kauppatori 12, Siikalatva. The living conditions were satisfactory, with basic furnishings and essential household items. However, the apartment was in need of minor repairs, including a leaky faucet and worn-out flooring.

Mrs. Kauriala appeared anxious but welcoming during our conversation. She expressed gratitude for the support services provided by the social services department and mentioned that she had been struggling to adjust to Finnish customs and language. The newborn infant, a 2-month-old boy named Juhani, was observed to be healthy and content.

Notable concerns included Mrs. Kauriala's limited access to healthcare services and her lack of knowledge about local resources for refugee families. She also mentioned feeling isolated from the community due to her limited Finnish language skills.

Assessment:
The situation appears to be low-risk at this time, with no immediate concerns for the safety or well-being of Mrs. Kauriala and Juhani. However, it is essential to monitor their progress and provide ongoing support to ensure a successful integration into Finnish society.

Family dynamics were observed to be positive, with Mrs. Kauriala expressing love and care for her infant son. The mother reported that she had been receiving support from her family in Syria before fleeing the country, but this support was limited due to the ongoing conflict.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Schedule a follow-up visit within 6 weeks to assess Mrs. Kauriala's progress in adapting to Finnish customs and language.
2. Arrange for an interpreter to accompany Mrs. Kauriala during her first healthcare appointment to ensure she receives accurate information about local services.
3. Refer Mrs. Kauriala to a local refugee organization that provides cultural orientation and language classes.
4. Provide Mrs. Kauriala with information about community resources, including social events and support groups for refugee families.
