Social Services Visit Report

Date: 05.09.2024
Location: Pielavesi, Finland
Visit Type: Refugee Integration Support Visit

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to assess the well-being and integration needs of the Kauranen family, a married couple with four children, who are refugees in Finland. The case severity is critical due to concerns about the family's living conditions, emotional state, and potential risks to their safety.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival at the family's residence, located at Kauppatori 12, Pielavesi, I observed a cluttered and cramped living space with limited access to natural light. The family reported difficulties in adapting to Finnish culture and language, which has led to feelings of isolation and frustration. The children, aged 8-14, were seen playing alone for extended periods, indicating potential social isolation.

During the interview, the parents, Juhani and Leila Kauranen, expressed concerns about their safety and well-being in Finland. They reported experiencing bullying at school and difficulties accessing essential services due to language barriers. The family's emotional state was characterized by anxiety, stress, and feelings of hopelessness.

Assessment:
The assessment revealed a critical situation where the family is struggling to cope with the challenges of refugee integration. The living conditions are substandard, and the family's social isolation is exacerbating their emotional distress. There are concerns about the children's safety and well-being, as they are not receiving adequate support or protection.

Family dynamics were observed to be strained, with tensions between Juhani and Leila arising from cultural differences and language barriers. The parents' relationship appears to be under strain, which may impact their ability to provide a stable environment for their children.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
Based on the assessment, I recommend the following actions:

1. Immediate referral to a social worker specializing in refugee integration support to provide guidance and assistance with accessing essential services.
2. Coordination with local schools to develop a plan to support the children's education and socialization.
3. Arrangement of language classes for Juhani and Leila to improve their proficiency in Finnish.
4. Assistance with securing alternative housing, if necessary, due to the substandard living conditions.
5. Regular follow-up visits to monitor the family's progress and provide ongoing support.

Timeline:

* Within 2 weeks: Arrange language classes for Juhani and Leila
* Within 4 weeks: Coordinate with local schools to develop a plan for the children's education and socialization
* Within 6 weeks: Conduct a follow-up visit to assess the family's progress and adjust recommendations as needed
