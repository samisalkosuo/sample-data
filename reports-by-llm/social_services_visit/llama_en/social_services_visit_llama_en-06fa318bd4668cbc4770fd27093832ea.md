Social Services Visit Report

Date: 28 March 2025
Location: Hämeenkyrö, Finland
Visit Type: Disability Support Assessment

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct a disability support assessment for the multi-generational household residing at address 123 Kruununhaka Street, Hämeenkyrö. The referral was made due to concerns about the family's financial difficulties and potential impact on their well-being.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, I met with Mrs. Maria Lehtonen, a 65-year-old grandmother, who is caring for her 85-year-old father, Mr. Eero Lehtonen, and her 35-year-old son, Mr. Antti Lehtonen, who has a disability requiring ongoing support. The household was found to be in a state of moderate disorganization, with cluttered living areas and inadequate storage facilities.

During the assessment, I observed Mrs. Lehtonen's emotional state as anxious and stressed, while Mr. Eero Lehtonen appeared withdrawn and isolated. Antti Lehtonen seemed overwhelmed by his responsibilities and struggled to manage his disability-related expenses. The family's financial situation was further complicated by a recent job loss affecting their income.

Assessment:
The household faces significant challenges due to the father's disability, Mrs. Lehtonen's caregiving role, and the family's financial difficulties. The moderate severity of the case indicates that while the situation is not critical, it requires attention to prevent escalation. The family's living conditions and emotional state suggest a need for support to address their well-being and stability.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
Based on the assessment, I recommend the following:

1. Referral to local disability services for Antti Lehtonen to access support and resources for his disability.
2. Connection with a social worker specializing in caregiving support for Mrs. Lehtonen to provide guidance on managing her father's care and accessing respite services.
3. Assistance with financial planning and budgeting to help the family manage their expenses and reduce stress.
4. Home safety assessment to identify potential hazards and provide recommendations for modifications or adaptations.

Timeline:
- Follow-up visit within 6 weeks to assess progress and adjust support plans as needed.
- Referral to local disability services will be made within the next fortnight, pending confirmation of eligibility.

Conclusion:
This report highlights the need for ongoing support to address the complex challenges faced by this multi-generational household. By providing targeted interventions and connecting them with relevant resources, we can help improve their well-being and stability in Hämeenkyrö.
