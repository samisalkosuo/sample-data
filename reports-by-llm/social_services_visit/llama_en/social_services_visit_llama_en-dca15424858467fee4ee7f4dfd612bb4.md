Social Services Visit Report

Date: 10.10.2024
Location: Huittinen, Finland
Visit Type: Follow-up on school truancy report

Summary of Visit Purpose:
This visit was conducted to follow up on the school truancy report submitted by the school authorities regarding [Client Name], a youth who is aging out of the foster system. The purpose of this visit was to assess the current situation, living conditions, and overall well-being of the client.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival at the address provided (Kadunpuisto 12, Huittinen), I met with [Client Name], a 17-year-old youth who is currently residing in their own apartment. The client appeared relaxed and cooperative during our conversation. They reported that they have been attending school regularly since the last visit and are taking steps to improve their academic performance.

The living conditions of the apartment were satisfactory, with basic amenities such as cooking facilities, bedding, and cleaning supplies available. However, there were some signs of disorganization, including scattered clothes and personal belongings. The client acknowledged that they have been struggling to maintain a clean and tidy environment due to lack of motivation.

During our conversation, I observed that the client seemed to be in a positive emotional state, expressing gratitude for the support provided by the foster system during their stay. However, there were some concerns raised regarding the client's social connections and relationships outside of school. They reported feeling isolated and lacking meaningful interactions with peers and family members.

Assessment:
Based on the observations made during this visit, I assess the situation as low-severity. The client appears to be taking steps to improve their academic performance and is maintaining a basic level of living conditions. However, there are some concerns regarding social connections and emotional well-being that require further attention.

Family dynamics were not directly observed during this visit, but it was mentioned that the client's biological parents are no longer in contact with them. The foster system has been providing support and guidance throughout their stay, and the client seems to appreciate this support.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Schedule a follow-up visit within 6 weeks to assess the client's continued progress in school and living conditions.
2. Refer the client to a local youth organization that provides social activities and mentorship programs to help them build meaningful relationships with peers and community members.
3. Provide the client with information about counseling services available in Huittinen, as they reported feeling isolated and struggling with emotional well-being.
