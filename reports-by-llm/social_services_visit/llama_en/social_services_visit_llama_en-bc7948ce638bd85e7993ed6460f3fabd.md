Social Services Visit Report

Date: 08.05.2025
Location: Juupajoki, Finland
Visit Type: Youth Mentoring Program Assessment
Case Severity: Urgent

Summary of Visit Purpose:
This visit was conducted as part of an urgent assessment for a refugee family residing in temporary accommodation in Juupajoki, Finland. The purpose of the visit was to evaluate the suitability of the youth mentoring program for this family and assess the risks associated with their current living situation.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival at the temporary accommodation, I observed a sense of unease among the family members, particularly the parents, Mr. and Mrs. Kauri. They appeared anxious and preoccupied, which may be attributed to their recent relocation from their home country. The children, aged 12 and 15, seemed hesitant to engage in conversation, displaying signs of withdrawal.

The living conditions were satisfactory, with basic amenities provided by the accommodation provider. However, the family's belongings were limited, and they were struggling to adjust to their new environment. Notable concerns included the lack of access to recreational activities and socialization opportunities for the children.

During our interaction, Mr. and Mrs. Kauri expressed feelings of isolation and disconnection from their community. They reported difficulties in navigating the Finnish language and cultural norms, which has led to increased stress levels. The parents also mentioned that they were struggling to find employment, further exacerbating their emotional state.

Assessment:
Given the urgent case severity, it is essential to prioritize the family's well-being and provide them with immediate support. The youth mentoring program may be beneficial in addressing the children's social isolation and providing them with a sense of belonging. However, it is crucial to address the parents' emotional state and provide them with language training and cultural orientation services.

The family's living situation poses risks due to their limited access to resources and social connections. It is essential to ensure that they have access to basic necessities, including food, clothing, and healthcare. Furthermore, the family's employment prospects are a significant concern, as unemployment can exacerbate their emotional state and create further stress.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Immediate referral to language training services for Mr. and Mrs. Kauri to enhance their Finnish language skills.
2. Connection with local community organizations to provide the family with access to recreational activities and socialization opportunities.
3. Employment support services to assist the parents in finding employment that aligns with their skills and interests.
4. Regular home visits to monitor the family's well-being and provide ongoing support.
5. Follow-up assessment in 6 weeks to evaluate the effectiveness of the youth mentoring program and make any necessary adjustments.

Timeline for Further Visits:

* 06.05.2025: Initial follow-up visit to assess the family's progress and adjust recommendations as needed.
* 13.05.2025: Second follow-up visit to evaluate the effectiveness of employment support services and provide further guidance.
