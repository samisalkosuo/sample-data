Social Services Visit Report

Date: 05.09.2024
Location: Jomala, Finland
Visit Type: Mental Health Monitoring Visit

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct a mental health monitoring visit for the recently relocated immigrant family residing at address 123 Kruununhaka Street, Jomala, Finland. The visit aimed to assess the family's well-being and provide support in adapting to their new environment.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival, I observed that the family of four (two adults and two children) was welcoming but appeared slightly anxious. They were eager to discuss their concerns and struggles with adjusting to life in Finland. The parents, Mr. and Mrs. Ali, reported feeling overwhelmed by the cultural differences and language barriers. Their children, Amira (12) and Jusuf (9), seemed to be coping better, but expressed occasional feelings of homesickness.

The living conditions were satisfactory, with a comfortable home environment and adequate resources for basic needs. However, I noted that the family was struggling to access local healthcare services due to language barriers and lack of familiarity with Finnish healthcare system.

During our conversation, Mr. Ali shared concerns about his mental health, stating that he had been experiencing anxiety and depression since their relocation. Mrs. Ali reported feeling isolated and struggling to connect with other families in the community. The children seemed to be adjusting well academically but were showing signs of emotional distress.

Assessment:
The family's situation is characterized as moderate risk due to the parents' mental health concerns, language barriers, and limited access to local support services. The family's ability to adapt to their new environment has been hindered by cultural differences and lack of social connections. However, the children appear to be coping relatively well.

Recommendations:

1. Referral to Finnish Mental Health Services: I will provide Mr. Ali with information about local mental health services and encourage him to seek professional help.
2. Language Support: I will arrange for language classes or interpretation services to facilitate access to healthcare and social services.
3. Community Integration: I will connect the family with local community organizations that cater to immigrant families, promoting social connections and cultural adaptation.
4. Follow-up Visits: Regular follow-up visits will be scheduled to monitor the family's progress, address any emerging concerns, and provide ongoing support.

Timeline for Further Visits:

* Next visit: 02.10.2024
* Follow-up visits: Every 6 weeks until the end of the 12-month monitoring period
