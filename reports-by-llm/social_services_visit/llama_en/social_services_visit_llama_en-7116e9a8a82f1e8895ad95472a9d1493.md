Social Services Visit Report

Date: 24 April 2025
Location: Salo, Finland
Visit Type: Routine family wellbeing visit
Case Severity: Moderate

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this routine family wellbeing visit was to assess the current situation and living conditions of single adult, Juhani Kärkkäinen, who has an intellectual disability. The visit aimed to identify any potential risks or concerns that may require support or intervention.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival at 12300 Tiedenranta, Salo, I met with Juhani in his living room. He was cooperative and engaged during our conversation, sharing information about his daily routine, social activities, and emotional state. Notable observations include:

* Juhani's flat is clean and well-maintained, indicating a good level of self-care.
* He has a regular schedule for medication management, which he takes with the assistance of a local pharmacy.
* Juhani reported feeling generally happy and content, but expressed occasional feelings of loneliness due to limited social interactions.

However, some concerns were raised during our conversation:

* Juhani's phone battery life is relatively short, and he struggles to charge it regularly. This may impact his ability to stay connected with friends and family.
* He mentioned that he sometimes experiences anxiety when receiving visitors, which can be overwhelming due to his sensory sensitivities.

Assessment:
Based on the observations during our visit, Juhani's living conditions appear to be stable, but there are some areas of concern that require attention. The moderate case severity indicates a need for ongoing support and monitoring to ensure Juhani's wellbeing is maintained.

The assessment also highlighted the importance of addressing Juhani's social isolation and anxiety triggers. Providing him with alternative ways to stay connected, such as video calls or online communities, could help alleviate feelings of loneliness. Additionally, exploring strategies to manage his anxiety when receiving visitors may be beneficial in reducing stress and promoting a sense of safety.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Arrange for Juhani to receive a new phone battery with extended capacity to improve connectivity.
2. Refer Juhani to a local social club or organization that caters to individuals with intellectual disabilities, which could provide opportunities for socialization and activities.
3. Schedule follow-up visits every 6-8 weeks to monitor Juhani's wellbeing and address any emerging concerns.
4. Collaborate with the local pharmacy to explore options for improving Juhani's medication management routine.

Timeline:

* Next visit: 24 June 2025
* Follow-up phone call: 15 May 2025
