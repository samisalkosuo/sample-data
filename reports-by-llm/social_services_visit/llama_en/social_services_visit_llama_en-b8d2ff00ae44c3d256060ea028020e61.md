Social Services Visit Report

Date: 11 January 2025
Location: Brändö, Finland
Visit Type: Homeless Outreach Visit

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct a homeless outreach assessment for a teenager residing in Brändö, Finland. The case was referred due to concerns about the individual's school attendance issues and potential risk factors associated with homelessness.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival at the address, 12300 Kustavi, Brändö, I met the teenager, identified as Juhani Laaksonen (age 16), who has been living on the streets for approximately six months. Juhani appeared anxious and guarded during our initial conversation, but gradually opened up about his situation.

The living conditions at the address were found to be unsanitary and cramped, with limited access to basic necessities such as clean water, electricity, and heating. The teenager reported having to share a small room with multiple other individuals, leading to conflicts and stress.

During our interaction, Juhani displayed behaviors indicative of trauma, including avoidance of eye contact and fidgeting. He also exhibited signs of emotional distress, such as tearfulness and irritability, particularly when discussing his school attendance issues.

Assessment:
The situation is characterized as moderate in terms of severity, with a high risk of exacerbation due to the individual's living conditions and lack of support systems. Juhani's school attendance issues are likely a result of his current circumstances, and addressing this issue will be crucial in helping him regain stability and access to education.

Family dynamics were not directly observed during the visit, but it is noted that Juhani has limited contact with family members due to his homelessness. Further assessment may be necessary to understand the extent of his family ties and potential support networks.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Immediate Referral: Juhani will be referred to local social services for assistance with finding permanent housing, as well as access to basic necessities such as food, clothing, and healthcare.
2. School Support: The teenager will be connected with a school counselor to address his attendance issues and develop a plan to support his education.
3. Mental Health Services: Juhani will be referred to a local mental health service provider for assessment and potential treatment of trauma-related symptoms.
4. Follow-up Visits: Regular follow-up visits will be scheduled to monitor Juhani's progress, provide ongoing support, and adjust the case plan as necessary.

Timeline:

* Immediate referral to social services and school counselor
* First follow-up visit within 2 weeks
* Second follow-up visit within 6 weeks

This report concludes that Juhani Laaksonen requires immediate attention and support to address his homelessness, school attendance issues, and potential trauma-related symptoms. Ongoing monitoring and collaboration with local service providers will be essential in helping him regain stability and access to basic necessities.
