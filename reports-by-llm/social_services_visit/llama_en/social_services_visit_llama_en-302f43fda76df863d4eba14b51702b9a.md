Date: 07.07.2025
Location: Rääkkylä, Finland
Visit Type: Domestic relocation follow-up

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct a follow-up assessment on the domestic relocation of [Client Name], an adult with severe mental health conditions, who has been living in Rääkkylä. The visit aimed to evaluate the current situation, assess any potential risks or concerns, and provide recommendations for further support.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival at the residence, I observed that [Client Name] was experiencing a high level of anxiety and agitation. They reported feeling overwhelmed by the relocation process and struggling to adjust to their new living arrangements. The home environment appeared cluttered and disorganized, with some areas showing signs of neglect.

During our conversation, [Client Name] expressed feelings of isolation and loneliness, stating that they were finding it difficult to connect with neighbors and local community resources. They also reported experiencing flashbacks and nightmares related to their mental health condition, which seemed to be exacerbated by the relocation stress.

Notable concerns included the presence of unsecured medications in the home, potential hazards such as exposed wiring and sharp objects, and the need for improved access to mental health services and support networks.

Assessment:
The current situation appears to be high-risk due to [Client Name]'s severe mental health condition, lack of social connections, and inadequate living conditions. The relocation process has likely exacerbated their stress levels, increasing the risk of relapse or worsening symptoms.

Family dynamics were not directly observed during this visit, but it is essential to note that [Client Name] lives alone with no immediate family members in the residence. However, regular contact with family members and friends outside of the home may be necessary to provide emotional support and help mitigate feelings of isolation.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Immediate Referral: Arrange for an emergency mental health assessment and stabilization at a local hospital or clinic.
2. Home Safety Assessment: Conduct a thorough safety assessment to identify potential hazards and implement measures to mitigate risks.
3. Social Support Network Development: Facilitate connections with local community resources, support groups, and mental health services to help [Client Name] build a social network and access necessary support.
4. Regular Follow-up Visits: Schedule bi-weekly visits to monitor progress, provide emotional support, and adjust recommendations as needed.

Timeline for Further Visits:
- Bi-weekly follow-up visits will be scheduled until [Client Name]'s mental health condition is stabilized and they demonstrate improved coping mechanisms.
- A comprehensive home safety assessment will be conducted within the next two weeks to identify areas for improvement.

Conclusion:
This visit highlighted the need for immediate attention and support for [Client Name]. The proposed recommendations aim to address the high-risk situation, provide necessary resources, and facilitate a safe and stable living environment.
