Social Services Visit Report

Date: 29 November 2024
Location: Hattula, Finland
Visit Type: Juvenile Probation Compliance Visit

Summary of Visit Purpose:
This visit was conducted to assess the compliance of the juvenile, Aino Virtanen (age 12), with the conditions set by her probation order following a reported neglect case. The purpose of this visit is to evaluate the family's ability to provide a safe and nurturing environment for Aino, while also monitoring any changes in the household dynamics.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival at the address, 12300 Hattula, Finland (Aino Virtanen's residence), I observed that the two-parent household was generally tidy and well-maintained. However, there were signs of disorganization in the living areas, with cluttered shelves and scattered toys. The parents, Antti and Leena Virtanen, appeared to be cooperative during the visit but seemed slightly anxious about the purpose of my presence.

During our conversation, I noted that Aino reported feeling more comfortable at home since the implementation of the probation order's conditions, including regular family meetings and increased supervision from a social worker. However, she also expressed concerns about her parents' arguments and the lack of quality time spent together as a family. The parents acknowledged these issues but stated they were working to improve their communication and relationship.

Notable Concerns:
During the visit, I observed that Aino's emotional state appeared stable, but there were moments where she seemed anxious or withdrawn. This could be indicative of ongoing stress related to her parents' arguments and the probation order. The parents' ability to manage these situations effectively will be crucial in ensuring Aino's well-being.

Assessment:
Based on my observations during this visit, I assess the situation as moderate in terms of case severity. While there are signs of improvement in the family's dynamics, particularly with regards to Aino's comfort level at home, there are still concerns regarding the parents' ability to manage their relationship and provide a stable environment for Aino.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
In light of this visit, I recommend that:

1. The social worker assigned to Aino's case schedule regular family meetings to monitor progress and provide support.
2. Antti and Leena Virtanen participate in couples therapy sessions to address their relationship issues and improve communication.
3. The family receives guidance on stress management techniques and conflict resolution strategies.
4. Regular home visits will be conducted to ensure compliance with the probation order's conditions and to monitor Aino's emotional state.

Timeline for Further Visits:
The next visit is scheduled for 15 January 2025, at which time I will assess the family's progress in addressing their relationship issues and improving their ability to provide a safe and nurturing environment for Aino.
