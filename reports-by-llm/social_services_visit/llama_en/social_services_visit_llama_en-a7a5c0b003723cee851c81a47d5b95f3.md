Social Services Visit Report

Date: 16 September 2024
Location: Utajärvi, Finland
Visit Type: Household Financial Hardship Review

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct a review of the household's financial situation in light of the elderly woman's early dementia symptoms. The moderate case severity indicates that while the situation is concerning, it does not require immediate emergency intervention.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival at the residence, I met with Mrs. Maria Lehtonen, an 85-year-old woman living alone in her family home. She appeared disoriented and had difficulty recalling recent events. Her caregiver, a local volunteer organization, was present to assist with daily tasks.

The household's financial situation appears precarious, with limited income and high expenses for medication, healthcare services, and basic necessities. Mrs. Lehtonen's dementia symptoms are affecting her ability to manage finances, leading to concerns about food security and potential neglect.

Notable concerns include:

* Limited access to public transportation, making it difficult for Mrs. Lehtonen to attend medical appointments or engage in social activities.
* High levels of debt, including unpaid bills and outstanding loans.
* Insufficient storage space, resulting in cluttered living areas and potential fire hazards.

Assessment:
The situation is moderate in severity due to the household's financial strain and Mrs. Lehtonen's declining cognitive abilities. However, there are risks associated with neglect and potential harm to Mrs. Lehtonen's physical and emotional well-being.

Family dynamics appear strained, with limited support from family members who live far away. The caregiver organization is doing their best to provide assistance, but resources are limited.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Referral to local non-profit organizations providing financial assistance for seniors, such as the Finnish Association for the Aged (Suomen vanhusten liitto).
2. Coordination with healthcare services to ensure regular medical check-ups and medication management.
3. Assistance with accessing public transportation options, including potential adaptations or modifications to her vehicle.
4. Home safety assessments to address fire hazards and cluttered living areas.

Timeline for Follow-up Visits:

* Within the next 6 weeks: Schedule a follow-up visit to assess progress on financial assistance and home safety improvements.
* Within the next 3 months: Conduct a comprehensive review of Mrs. Lehtonen's healthcare needs, including medication management and potential adaptations to her care plan.
