Social Services Visit Report

Date: 22 April 2025
Location: Posio, Finland
Visit Type: Foster family evaluation
Case Severity: High

Summary of Visit Purpose:
This visit was conducted to evaluate the foster family's ability to provide a safe and supportive environment for [Client Name], an elderly individual in need of care. The high case severity level warrants close monitoring due to concerns about [Client Name]'s well-being, safety, and potential risk of neglect or abuse.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, I observed that the foster family, Mr. and Mrs. Kauriala, were welcoming but appeared somewhat overwhelmed by [Client Name]'s needs. The living conditions were generally clean and tidy, with adequate space for mobility. However, there were signs of clutter and disorganization in certain areas, which may pose a tripping hazard.

During our conversation, Mr. and Mrs. Kauriala expressed concerns about [Client Name]'s increasing dependence on them for daily tasks, such as bathing and dressing. They reported feeling frustrated and isolated due to their inability to provide the level of care they feel [Client Name] requires. I observed that [Client Name] seemed anxious and withdrawn during our interactions, suggesting a need for increased emotional support.

Assessment:
The assessment reveals a complex situation where the foster family is struggling to meet [Client Name]'s needs while also managing their own well-being. The high case severity level is justified by the presence of risk factors, including [Client Name]'s potential for falls and injuries due to cluttered living conditions, as well as the emotional strain on the foster family.

The foster family's dynamics appear strained, with Mr. and Mrs. Kauriala displaying conflicting attitudes towards their role in caring for [Client Name]. While they express a desire to provide care, they also seem to be struggling with feelings of resentment and frustration. This tension may compromise the quality of care provided to [Client Name].

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Immediate Referral: I recommend an immediate referral to our geriatric care services to assess [Client Name]'s needs and develop a comprehensive care plan.
2. Support Services: The foster family will benefit from counseling sessions to address their emotional strain and improve communication dynamics.
3. Home Safety Assessment: A home safety assessment will be conducted to identify potential hazards and implement necessary modifications to ensure [Client Name]'s safety.
4. Regular Visits: I propose regular visits (every 2 weeks) to monitor the foster family's ability to provide adequate care, as well as [Client Name]'s overall well-being.

Timeline for Follow-up:
- 30 April 2025: Home safety assessment and implementation of necessary modifications
- 6 May 2025: First counseling session with the foster family
- 14 May 2025: Comprehensive geriatric care plan development

By implementing these recommendations, we can ensure [Client Name] receives the necessary support to thrive in a safe and nurturing environment.
