Social Services Visit Report

Date: 05.11.2024
Location: Rauma, Finland
Visit Type: Disability Support Assessment

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct a disability support assessment for an adult living with severe mental health conditions in Rauma, Finland. The assessment aimed to evaluate the individual's needs and provide recommendations for support services to ensure their well-being and safety.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival at the address, 12300 Kemi√∂nkatu, 30100 Rauma, Finland (hereafter referred to as "the residence"), I was greeted by the adult in question, Mr. Antti Laaksonen. He appeared disheveled and had difficulty articulating his thoughts due to his mental health condition. The living conditions were generally clean, but there were signs of clutter and disorganization throughout the residence.

During our conversation, it became apparent that Mr. Laaksonen struggles with managing his daily routines, including personal hygiene and meal preparation. He also reported feelings of isolation and loneliness, which exacerbate his mental health symptoms. Notable concerns included the presence of unopened medication bottles and expired food items, indicating potential neglect.

Assessment:
Given the severity of Mr. Laaksonen's mental health condition, it is clear that he requires ongoing support to ensure his safety and well-being. The assessment revealed a high risk of self-neglect and social isolation, which can worsen his symptoms if left unaddressed. Family dynamics were not explored in depth during this visit, but it is essential to consider the potential impact of Mr. Laaksonen's condition on his relationships with family members or caregivers.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Referral to local mental health services: I will arrange for an appointment at the Rauma Health Centre to facilitate access to specialized mental health treatment and support.
2. Home care assistance: A home care worker will be assigned to provide regular visits, assisting with daily tasks such as personal hygiene, meal preparation, and household chores.
3. Social isolation reduction strategies: I recommend exploring local community groups or social activities that can help Mr. Laaksonen connect with others and reduce feelings of loneliness.
4. Follow-up visit within two weeks: A follow-up assessment will be conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the recommended actions and make any necessary adjustments.

Timeline for Further Visits:

* 02.12.2024: Follow-up visit to assess progress and adjust recommendations as needed
* 03.01.2025: Review of Mr. Laaksonen's treatment plan and ongoing support services
