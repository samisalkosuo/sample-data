Social Services Visit Report

Visit Date: 04.09.2024
Location: Kärkölä, Finland
Visit Type: Child Visitation Supervision Report

Summary of Visit Purpose:
This visit was conducted as part of an ongoing child visitation supervision report to assess the well-being and safety of the child in a household with a disabled adult and live-in caregiver. The case severity is high due to concerns about the caregiver's ability to provide adequate care and support for the child.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, I observed that the household was tidy, but there were signs of clutter and disorganization in certain areas. The disabled adult was seated in a wheelchair, with the live-in caregiver assisting them with daily tasks. The child (age 7) was present during the visit and appeared to be well-nourished and healthy. However, they displayed some anxiety when interacting with the caregiver, indicating potential emotional distress.

During our conversation, the caregiver reported that the disabled adult requires frequent medical attention and has limited mobility. They also mentioned that the child's father is not involved in their lives and that they are struggling to manage the household finances. The caregiver expressed feelings of overwhelm and frustration, which may be contributing to the high case severity.

Assessment:
The assessment suggests that the household faces significant challenges due to the disabled adult's needs and the caregiver's limited capacity to provide adequate care. The child's emotional well-being is a concern, as they appear to be struggling with anxiety and potential attachment issues. The lack of involvement from the child's father and the financial struggles may exacerbate these concerns.

Given the high case severity, it is essential to prioritize the child's safety and well-being. Further support services are necessary to address the caregiver's emotional distress and provide additional resources for managing the household finances.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Referral to a social worker specializing in disability support to assess the disabled adult's needs and develop a care plan.
2. Collaboration with local healthcare providers to ensure the disabled adult receives regular medical attention and necessary equipment.
3. Arrangement of counseling sessions for the caregiver to address emotional distress and develop coping strategies.
4. Assistance with household finances, including budgeting and financial planning, through a local non-profit organization.
5. Regular follow-up visits to monitor the child's well-being and adjust the support plan as needed.
