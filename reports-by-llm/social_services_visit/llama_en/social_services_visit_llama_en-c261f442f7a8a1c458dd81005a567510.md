Visit Date: 12.08.2024
Location: Reisjärvi, Finland
Visit Type: Routine family wellbeing visit
Household Composition: Single adult with intellectual disability
Case Severity: Low

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this routine family wellbeing visit was to assess the current situation and living conditions of single adult, Juhani Rautio, who has an intellectual disability. The visit aimed to identify any potential risks or concerns that may require support or intervention.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival at Juhani's residence in Reisjärvi, I observed a clean and well-maintained living environment. Juhani was cooperative during the visit and engaged in conversation about his daily activities, including his work as a part-time gardener. He reported feeling happy and content with his current living situation.

During our interaction, I noticed that Juhani's communication skills were clear and concise, but he occasionally required clarification or repetition of questions. His cognitive abilities are within expected ranges for an individual with intellectual disability.

Juhani's emotional state appeared stable, and he showed no signs of distress or anxiety during the visit. However, it was noted that he sometimes struggles with managing his finances independently, which may require additional support in the future.

Assessment:
Based on the observations during the visit, the situation appears to be stable, and Juhani is living independently with minimal support. The case severity is low, indicating that there are no significant risks or concerns that require immediate intervention.

However, it is essential to continue monitoring Juhani's situation to ensure his ongoing wellbeing and address any emerging issues promptly. Regular follow-up visits will provide an opportunity to assess his progress and make adjustments as needed.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Schedule a follow-up visit in 6 months to review Juhani's living situation, financial management, and overall wellbeing.
2. Consider referring Juhani to a local support group for individuals with intellectual disabilities to enhance his social connections and community engagement.
3. Provide guidance on managing finances independently, including budgeting and banking services, to ensure Juhani's long-term stability.

Timeline:

* Follow-up visit: 12.08.2025
* Referral to support group: pending

Conclusion:
This routine family wellbeing visit has provided an opportunity to assess Juhani Rautio's living situation and identify potential areas for support. The low case severity indicates that there are no immediate concerns, but ongoing monitoring and follow-up visits will ensure his continued wellbeing and address any emerging issues promptly.
