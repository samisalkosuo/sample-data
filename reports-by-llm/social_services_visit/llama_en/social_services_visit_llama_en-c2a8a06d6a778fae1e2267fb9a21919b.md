Social Services Visit Report

Visit Date: 06.09.2024
Location: Saarijärvi, Finland
Visit Type: Disability support assessment
Case Severity: Urgent

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct a disability support assessment for the child living with non-custodial relative in Saarijärvi, Finland. The case was classified as urgent due to concerns about the child's well-being and safety.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival, I met with the non-custodial relative, who appeared anxious and stressed. They reported that the child has been experiencing difficulties with daily activities, such as dressing and feeding themselves, due to a diagnosed disability. The child was present during the visit and seemed hesitant to interact with me.

The living conditions were found to be satisfactory, with adequate food, clothing, and hygiene facilities available. However, there were concerns about the lack of accessible equipment and adaptive tools for the child's daily needs. The non-custodial relative reported that they had been struggling to provide the necessary support due to limited financial resources.

During our conversation, I observed a power imbalance in the relationship between the non-custodial relative and the child. The relative appeared to be taking on a caregiving role without adequate training or support, which may be exacerbating the child's emotional distress.

Assessment:
The assessment revealed a complex situation with multiple risks and concerns. The child's disability is likely to require ongoing support and adaptations to ensure their safety and well-being. However, the non-custodial relative lacks the necessary resources and skills to provide adequate care, which may lead to further deterioration of the child's condition.

Family dynamics were found to be strained, with the non-custodial relative expressing feelings of guilt and frustration about their inability to provide sufficient support. The child's emotional state was observed to be anxious and withdrawn, suggesting a need for additional emotional support and counseling.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Immediate referral to a multidisciplinary team, including a pediatrician, occupational therapist, and social worker, to assess the child's needs and develop a comprehensive care plan.
2. Provision of adaptive equipment and tools to facilitate the child's daily activities and improve their quality of life.
3. Support services for the non-custodial relative, including counseling and respite care, to address their emotional distress and capacity-building needs.
4. Regular follow-up visits to monitor the child's progress, adjust the care plan as needed, and provide ongoing support to the non-custodial relative.

Timeline:

* Within 48 hours: Referral to multidisciplinary team and provision of adaptive equipment
* Within 2 weeks: Initial counseling sessions for the non-custodial relative
* Within 4 weeks: Follow-up visit to assess child's progress and adjust care plan as needed
