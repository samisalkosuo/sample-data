Social Services Visit Report

Date: 22.09.2024
Location: Kristiinankaupunki, Finland
Visit Type: Social reintegration assessment

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct a social reintegration assessment for the multi-generational household at address 123 Kruununhakaatu, Kristiinankaupunki. The referral was made due to concerns about financial difficulties and potential risks to family well-being.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival, I met with Mrs. Maria Lehtonen, a 55-year-old mother of two, who is struggling to manage household expenses. She reported that her husband, Mr. Antti Lehtonen, has been unemployed for several months due to health issues. The couple's adult children, Emma (25) and Juhani (22), are also experiencing financial difficulties, with Emma working part-time and Juhani relying on government benefits.

The household is cramped, with limited space for furniture and personal belongings. The kitchen and living areas are cluttered, and there is a noticeable lack of cleanliness. Mrs. Lehtonen expressed frustration and anxiety about the family's situation, feeling overwhelmed by the responsibilities of caring for her husband and children.

Assessment:
Based on the observations during the visit, it appears that this household is facing moderate-level financial difficulties, which are affecting their overall well-being. The family dynamics seem strained, with Mrs. Lehtonen shouldering a significant burden as the primary caregiver. There are concerns about the potential impact of prolonged unemployment on Mr. Lehtonen's health and the children's future prospects.

The household's living conditions also raise concerns about safety and hygiene. The lack of adequate space and cleanliness may exacerbate stress and anxiety, particularly for vulnerable family members such as Mrs. Lehtonen and her husband.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Referral to local employment services: I will refer the family to the Kristiinankaupunki Employment Office to explore options for Mr. Lehtonen's job search and training.
2. Financial assistance: The family may be eligible for financial assistance through the Finnish Social Security System. I will assist Mrs. Lehtonen in navigating this process and providing guidance on available resources.
3. Home safety assessment: Due to concerns about living conditions, I recommend a home safety assessment to identify potential hazards and provide recommendations for improvement.
4. Family counseling: Given the strained family dynamics, I suggest offering family counseling sessions to help the family address their emotional needs and develop coping strategies.

Next Steps:

* Schedule follow-up visits every 6 weeks to monitor progress and adjust support services as needed.
* Establish regular communication with Mrs. Lehtonen to provide ongoing support and guidance.
* Coordinate with local authorities to ensure timely delivery of financial assistance and other relevant services.
