Social Services Visit Report

Date: 10 January 2025
Location: Puolanka, Finland
Visit Type: Child Welfare Check
Case Severity: Low

Summary of Visit Purpose:
This visit was conducted as part of an ongoing child welfare check to assess the well-being and safety of the grandchildren residing with their grandparents in Puolanka. The purpose of this visit is to evaluate the living conditions, interactions between family members, and overall dynamics within the household.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival at the residence, located at Kirjalaantie 12, Puolanka, I was greeted by Grandma Liisa and Grandpa Matti, who welcomed me warmly. The grandchildren, Aino (8) and Eero (6), were also present during the visit. The living conditions were clean and tidy, with adequate space for all family members.

During our conversation, Grandma Liisa reported that she and Grandpa Matti have been caring for the children since their parents' separation. They have established a stable routine, which includes regular visits from the children's mother and father. The grandparents expressed their love and commitment to raising the children, citing their strong bond with them.

Notable concerns were raised regarding Aino's occasional tantrums during homework time, which Grandma Liisa attributed to her child being "a bit of a perfectionist." Eero, on the other hand, was observed to be energetic and playful, enjoying outdoor activities with his grandparents. Both children seemed happy and content in their environment.

Assessment:
Based on this visit, it appears that the household is stable and safe for the children. The grandparents have demonstrated a strong ability to care for the children's physical and emotional needs. However, it would be beneficial to monitor Aino's behavior during homework time to ensure she receives adequate support.

Family dynamics were observed to be positive, with Grandma Liisa and Grandpa Matti displaying a loving and supportive relationship towards each other and their grandchildren. The grandparents' commitment to co-parenting was also noted, as they work together to make decisions regarding the children's care.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Schedule a follow-up visit in 6 months to assess Aino's behavior during homework time.
2. Refer Grandma Liisa and Grandpa Matti to local parenting support groups for additional guidance on managing tantrums and promoting positive behaviors.
3. Maintain regular contact with the children's mother and father regarding their co-parenting efforts and any concerns that may arise.

Timeline:

* 6 months: Follow-up visit to assess Aino's behavior during homework time
* 12 months: Review of overall household dynamics and adjust recommendations as necessary
