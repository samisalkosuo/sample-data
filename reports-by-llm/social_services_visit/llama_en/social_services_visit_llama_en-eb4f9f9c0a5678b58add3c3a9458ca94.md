Social Services Visit Report

Visit Date: 21 January 2025
Location: Kemiönsaari, Finland
Visit Type: Child Visitation Supervision Report

Summary of Visit Purpose:
This visit was conducted as part of an ongoing child visitation supervision report for the family of five residing in a subsidized apartment in Kemiönsaari. The purpose of this visit was to assess the current living conditions, interactions between family members, and overall well-being of the children.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival, I observed that the family was present during my visit, although they seemed somewhat hesitant at first. The parents, Juhani and Leena, provided me with a warm welcome, while their three children (ages 8, 10, and 12) appeared more reserved. The living conditions in the apartment were satisfactory, with adequate space for the family of five.

During our conversation, I noted that the family was facing some financial difficulties, which had led to increased stress levels. Juhani and Leena reported struggling to make ends meet, while also managing their own mental health concerns. The children seemed to be coping well, but occasionally displayed signs of anxiety when discussing their parents' financial struggles.

Notable concerns during the visit included the presence of unopened packages of food in the pantry, suggesting potential difficulties with grocery shopping. Additionally, I observed that the living room was cluttered with unwashed dishes and laundry, indicating a need for improved household management.

Assessment:
Based on my observations, it appears that this family is facing moderate-level challenges due to financial stress and mental health concerns. While the children seem resilient, their parents' struggles may impact their overall well-being. The living conditions are satisfactory, but there is room for improvement in terms of household organization and meal planning.

Recommendations:

1. Referral to local food bank services to address ongoing grocery shopping difficulties.
2. Connection with a mental health professional for Juhani and Leena to support their individual and joint well-being.
3. Follow-up visit within six weeks to assess the family's progress in addressing these concerns.
4. Collaboration with the subsidized apartment management to explore potential assistance programs or resources available to support this family.

Follow-up:
A follow-up visit will be scheduled for 21 March 2025, at which time I will reassess the family's situation and provide further recommendations as needed.
