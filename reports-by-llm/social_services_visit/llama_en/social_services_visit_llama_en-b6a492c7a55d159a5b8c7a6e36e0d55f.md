Social Services Visit Report

Date: 26 January 2025
Location: Heinola, Finland
Visit Type: Support plan review meeting

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct a support plan review meeting for Mrs. Marja-Liisa Rissanen, an elderly woman living in Heinola, Finland. The visit aimed to assess the current situation, risks, and family dynamics in light of her early dementia symptoms, which were previously identified as low severity.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival at Mrs. Rissanen's residence, I observed a generally clean and organized living environment. However, there were some signs of clutter and disorganization in certain areas, particularly in the kitchen. Mrs. Rissanen herself appeared to be in good spirits, albeit slightly agitated during our conversation about her daily routine.

During our discussion, it became clear that Mrs. Rissanen is struggling with memory lapses and difficulty with navigation, which are exacerbating her early dementia symptoms. Her family members reported that she has become increasingly isolated, preferring to spend time alone rather than engaging in social activities.

Notable concerns included Mrs. Rissanen's tendency to wander away from home, particularly at night, and the lack of a reliable caregiver system in place. Her family members expressed concern about her safety and well-being, as well as their own emotional burden in caring for her.

Assessment:
Based on our conversation and observations, it appears that Mrs. Rissanen's situation has not significantly changed since our last visit six months ago. While her early dementia symptoms remain low severity, the lack of a comprehensive support plan and adequate caregiver resources is still a concern.

The family dynamics are complex, with multiple siblings and nieces/nephews involved in caregiving roles. However, there is a need for more structured support and guidance to ensure that everyone is working together effectively to meet Mrs. Rissanen's needs.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
In light of our assessment, I recommend the following:

1. Referral to a dementia support group for Mrs. Rissanen and her family members.
2. Collaboration with local healthcare services to develop a more comprehensive care plan, including medication management and regular check-ins.
3. Assistance in finding reliable caregiver resources, such as home care services or adult day care programs.
4. Follow-up visit within three months to review progress and provide ongoing support.

Timeline for Further Visits:
The next follow-up visit is scheduled for 26 June 2025, at which time we will assess the effectiveness of the implemented support plan and make any necessary adjustments.
