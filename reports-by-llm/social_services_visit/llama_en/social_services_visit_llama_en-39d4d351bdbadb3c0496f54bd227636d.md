Social Services Visit Report

Date: 06.05.2025
Location: Pihtipudas, Finland
Visit Type: Support plan review meeting

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct a support plan review meeting for the family residing at address 123 Koulukatu, Pihtipudas, Finland. The visit aimed to assess the current situation and provide guidance on managing the parent's substance use disorder while ensuring the well-being of the children.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, I observed that the household was tidy, but there were signs of disorganization in the kitchen and living areas. The parent, Mr. Antti Laaksonen, appeared anxious and agitated during our conversation. He reported feeling overwhelmed by his substance use disorder and struggling to maintain employment due to frequent absences. The children, aged 8 and 10, seemed hesitant to discuss their feelings about their father's behavior.

During the meeting, I noted that Mr. Laaksonen had been using substances for approximately six months, with a peak usage period during the winter months. He reported having difficulty managing his cravings and avoiding triggers. The children have been experiencing emotional distress due to their father's behavior, including anxiety and irritability.

Assessment:
The situation appears moderate in terms of severity, as Mr. Laaksonen's substance use disorder is impacting his daily life and relationships with his children. However, the family's overall well-being is still relatively stable, thanks to the support of local community services and social networks. It is essential to continue monitoring the situation and providing guidance on managing Mr. Laaksonen's substance use disorder.

Family dynamics are complex, with Mr. Laaksonen struggling to balance his responsibilities as a parent with his addiction. The children seem resilient but may require additional support to cope with their father's behavior. It is crucial to maintain open communication with the family and provide them with resources and referrals to address their specific needs.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Referral to local substance abuse treatment services for Mr. Laaksonen, including counseling and medication management.
2. Support group attendance for Mr. Laaksonen and his children to address emotional distress and develop coping strategies.
3. Regular home visits to monitor the family's situation and provide guidance on managing daily life.
4. Collaboration with local schools to ensure the children receive necessary support and accommodations.
5. Follow-up meeting in six weeks to assess progress, provide additional guidance, and adjust the support plan as needed.

Timeline for Further Visits:
- 06.12.2025: Follow-up meeting to review progress and adjust the support plan
- 03.03.2026: Home visit to monitor the family's situation and provide ongoing guidance
