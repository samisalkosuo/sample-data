Social Services Visit Report

Date: 28 August 2024
Location: J채mij채rvi, Finland
Visit Type: Elderly care follow-up
Case Severity: Moderate

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct a follow-up assessment on the well-being and living conditions of Mrs. Maria Lehtonen, a single mother with three children residing in J채mij채rvi, Finland. The visit aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the current elderly care arrangements and identify any potential risks or concerns that may require additional support.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, I observed that Mrs. Lehtonen was welcoming and cooperative during our conversation. She reported feeling overwhelmed with household responsibilities, particularly caring for her three children while managing her own health needs. The living conditions were generally clean and tidy, but there were signs of wear and tear on furniture and appliances.

During the visit, I noticed that the eldest child, 12-year-old Emma, seemed to be taking on more responsibility in helping with household chores, which may indicate a potential strain on her emotional well-being. Mrs. Lehtonen mentioned that she was struggling to balance work and family life, leading to feelings of anxiety and stress.

Assessment:
Based on the observations during the visit, it appears that Mrs. Lehtonen is facing significant challenges in managing her daily life, particularly with regards to household responsibilities and emotional well-being. The case severity is moderate due to the presence of multiple risk factors, including:

* Single parenthood with limited support
* Overwhelming workload and stress levels
* Potential strain on children's emotional well-being

The family dynamics seem to be strained, with Mrs. Lehtonen feeling isolated and in need of additional support.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
Based on the assessment, I recommend the following:

1. Continued elderly care support: The current arrangements should be reviewed and adjusted to ensure that Mrs. Lehtonen receives adequate assistance with household chores and personal care.
2. Referral to counseling services: Emma's increased responsibility for household chores may indicate a need for emotional support and guidance. A referral to counseling services, such as the Finnish Youth Counselling Service (Tukipuoli), would be beneficial.
3. Support for work-life balance: The social services department should explore options for providing additional support or resources to help Mrs. Lehtonen manage her workload and reduce stress levels.
4. Regular follow-up visits: To ensure that the situation does not deteriorate, regular follow-up visits will be scheduled every 6 weeks to monitor progress and provide ongoing support.

Timeline:

* Next visit: 18 September 2024
* Follow-up visits: Every 6 weeks until further notice
