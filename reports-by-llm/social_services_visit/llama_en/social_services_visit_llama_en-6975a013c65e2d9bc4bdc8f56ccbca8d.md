Social Services Visit Report

Date: 11.03.2025
Location: Kempele, Finland
Visit Type: Parental Capacity Evaluation

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct a parental capacity evaluation for [Client Name], a youth who is aging out of the foster system in Kempele, Finland. The evaluation aimed to assess the suitability of [Parent/Guardian Names] as caregivers for [Client Name]'s future well-being and safety.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival at the residence located at [Address: 123 Koulukatu, 48900 Kempele], I observed a warm and welcoming environment. The youth, [Client Name], was present during the visit and appeared to be comfortable with their living situation. However, there were some concerns regarding the cleanliness of the premises, which could potentially impact the health and well-being of the youth.

During our conversation, [Parent/Guardian Names] demonstrated a willingness to support [Client Name]'s transition into independent living. They expressed enthusiasm about providing guidance and mentorship during this critical period in their life. However, there were moments where they appeared uncertain about managing [Client Name]'s daily needs and responsibilities.

Assessment:
Based on the observations and conversations during the visit, I assessed that the situation is generally stable, with low risks to the youth's safety and well-being. However, there are some concerns that require attention:

1. Living conditions: The cleanliness of the residence could be improved to ensure a healthy environment for [Client Name].
2. Parental capacity: While [Parent/Guardian Names] demonstrated a willingness to support [Client Name], their ability to manage daily responsibilities and provide guidance during this transition period needs further evaluation.
3. Emotional well-being: [Client Name] appeared to be adjusting well to the living situation, but it is essential to monitor their emotional state and provide support as needed.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
Based on the assessment, I recommend the following:

1. Referral for home safety assessments to ensure a safe environment for [Client Name].
2. Collaboration with local social services to develop a plan for supporting [Parent/Guardian Names] in managing daily responsibilities and providing guidance during [Client Name]'s transition.
3. Regular check-ins with [Client Name] to monitor their emotional well-being and provide support as needed.

Timeline:
The next visit is scheduled for 15.04.2025, six weeks from the date of this report. I will also schedule a follow-up meeting with [Parent/Guardian Names] in three months to assess their progress in managing daily responsibilities and providing guidance during [Client Name]'s transition.
