Social Services Visit Report

Date: 07.07.2025
Location: Kankaanpää, Finland
Visit Type: Emergency housing verification
Case Severity: Low

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct an emergency housing verification for a household in need of support. The referral indicated that the two adult siblings, Aku Päivinen and Leena Päivinen, were facing difficulties with their living arrangements due to financial constraints.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, I met with Aku and Leena at their shared housing unit located at Kankaanpääntie 12, 28800 Kankaanpää. The siblings greeted me warmly and provided an overview of their situation. They reported that they had been struggling to make ends meet due to reduced income and increasing expenses. Despite this, they expressed gratitude for the support and resources offered by social services.

During our conversation, I observed a positive and supportive relationship between Aku and Leena. They demonstrated mutual respect and understanding, which is essential for their well-being. However, there were some concerns regarding the cleanliness of the living space, with visible signs of clutter and disorganization in certain areas.

Assessment:
Based on my observations during the visit, I assessed that the situation is low-severity, as both siblings are capable of managing their daily lives and maintaining a basic level of hygiene. However, it is essential to provide ongoing support to ensure they can continue to meet their basic needs.

The family dynamics appear stable, with no reported conflicts or concerns regarding child care or elderly care. The siblings' ability to work together and rely on each other for emotional support is a positive aspect of their relationship.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
Based on my assessment, I recommend the following:

1. Ongoing financial assistance: Provide Aku and Leena with continued financial support to help them manage their expenses.
2. Household maintenance support: Offer assistance with household chores and cleaning services to improve the living environment.
3. Referral to local resources: Refer the siblings to local organizations that provide food banks, clothing drives, and other essential services.

Timeline for Follow-up:
I propose a follow-up visit in 6 weeks to assess the effectiveness of the recommended actions and provide additional support if needed.
