Social Services Visit Report

Visit Date: 26 May 2025
Location: Tyrnävä, Finland
Visit Type: Newborn and Infant Safety Visit
Household Composition: Disabled adult (Mr. Juhani Kärkkäinen) and live-in caregiver (Ms. Maria Lehtonen)
Case Severity: Low

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to assess the safety and well-being of the newborn child, born on 15 May 2025, in a household with a disabled adult and a live-in caregiver. The visit aimed to evaluate the family's ability to provide a safe and nurturing environment for the infant.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, Ms. Lehtonen greeted us warmly and provided information about her husband, Mr. Kärkkäinen, who has been living with a disability since a young age. She reported that he is currently receiving social services support to maintain his independence. The home was clean and tidy, with adequate storage for baby supplies.

During the visit, we observed Ms. Lehtonen expertly caring for the newborn, ensuring proper feeding, bathing, and sleep schedules. Mr. Kärkkäinen watched over the child from a comfortable distance, occasionally offering gentle assistance when needed. The atmosphere was calm and loving, with both caregivers expressing genuine affection for their infant.

Notable concerns arose during the visit when we noticed that the home's emergency preparedness plan was not fully implemented. Ms. Lehtonen mentioned that she had not received any training on infant CPR or first aid. We also observed that the smoke detector in the living room was not functioning properly, which raised concerns about potential fire hazards.

Assessment:
Based on our observations and discussions with the caregivers, we assessed the situation as low-risk for immediate harm to the child. However, we identified areas requiring attention to ensure a safe environment:

1. Emergency preparedness: Ms. Lehtonen will receive training in infant CPR and first aid within the next two weeks.
2. Smoke detector maintenance: The smoke detector will be replaced with a new one that meets current safety standards.

Family dynamics appeared stable, with both caregivers expressing love and commitment to their child. However, we noted that Mr. Kärkkäinen's disability may impact his ability to participate fully in caregiving responsibilities. We recommended regular check-ins with social services to monitor the situation and provide support as needed.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Ms. Lehtonen will attend an infant CPR and first aid training session within two weeks.
2. The smoke detector will be replaced with a new one that meets current safety standards.
3. Regular check-ins with social services will be scheduled every six months to monitor the situation and provide support as needed.

Next steps:
We will schedule a follow-up visit in six months to assess the implementation of recommended actions and provide further support if necessary.
