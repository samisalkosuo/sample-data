Social Services Visit Report

Date: 01.08.2025
Location: Salla, Finland
Visit Type: Elderly care follow-up
Case Severity: Low

Summary of Visit Purpose:
This visit was conducted as part of an ongoing elderly care follow-up for the cohabiting couple, Mr. and Mrs. Taavitsainen (born in 1942 and 1950 respectively), residing at their home in Salla, Finland. The purpose of this visit was to assess their living conditions, provide support, and address any concerns related to their mental health challenges.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, I observed that Mr. Taavitsainen was struggling with his morning routine due to a recent episode of anxiety. Mrs. Taavitsainen provided emotional support and assistance, which helped him regain composure. The couple's living conditions were generally clean and tidy, but there were signs of disorganization in the kitchen and cluttered storage areas.

During our conversation, I noted that both Mr. and Mrs. Taavitsainen reported feeling isolated due to their mental health challenges. They expressed a desire for social interaction and support from family and friends, which is essential for their well-being. However, they also mentioned that their children live far away in the city, making it difficult for them to maintain regular contact.

Assessment:
Given the low case severity, I assessed that the couple's situation is stable, but requires ongoing support and monitoring. The cohabiting arrangement has its benefits, as both partners provide emotional support and assistance with daily tasks. However, their mental health challenges pose a risk of exacerbating their isolation and decreasing their quality of life.

Family dynamics were observed to be generally positive, with the couple showing affection and care for each other. However, there was a noticeable lack of communication between them regarding their needs and concerns. This highlights the importance of regular support sessions and counseling to address these issues.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
Based on my assessment, I recommend:

1. Regular follow-up visits every 6-8 weeks to monitor the couple's situation and provide ongoing support.
2. Referral to a local mental health organization for counseling sessions to address their anxiety and depression.
3. Assistance with organizing social activities and outings to help them stay connected with family and friends.
4. Home safety assessment to identify potential hazards and implement measures to prevent accidents.

Timeline:

* Next follow-up visit: 15.09.2025
* Referral to mental health organization: within the next two weeks

Conclusion:
This visit demonstrated that Mr. and Mrs. Taavitsainen are receiving adequate support, but require ongoing attention to address their mental health challenges and social isolation. By providing regular follow-up visits, referrals to relevant services, and assistance with social activities, we can help them maintain a stable and fulfilling life in their cohabiting arrangement.
