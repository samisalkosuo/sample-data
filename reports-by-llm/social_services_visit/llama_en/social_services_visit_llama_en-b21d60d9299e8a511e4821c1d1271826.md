Social Services Visit Report

Date: 20 April 2025

Location: Kalajoki, Finland

Visit Type: Domestic Relocation Follow-up

Case Number: KAL-2023-001

Client Name: Leevi Rissanen
Address: Kauppatori 12, 69100 Kalajoki, Finland

Summary of Visit Purpose:
This visit was conducted to assess the well-being and adjustment of Leevi Rissanen, a teenager in foster care, following his recent domestic relocation. The purpose of this follow-up visit is to evaluate the effectiveness of the relocation plan, identify any emerging concerns, and provide support to ensure Leevi's continued safety and success.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, I observed that Leevi was initially hesitant to engage with me, but eventually warmed up after a brief conversation. He reported feeling anxious about his new living arrangements and struggling to adjust to the change. The foster family, the Lappalaisen, seemed supportive and accommodating, but appeared to be experiencing some challenges in managing Leevi's behavior.

During the visit, I noted that the living conditions were satisfactory, with adequate space for Leevi's belongings and a clean environment. However, there were signs of disorganization, which may contribute to Leevi's feelings of anxiety. The Lappalaisen family reported that Leevi had been experiencing mood swings and difficulty sleeping since his relocation.

Assessment:
The situation appears to be high-risk due to Leevi's emotional distress and the challenges faced by the foster family in managing his behavior. It is essential to provide ongoing support and guidance to ensure Leevi's well-being and safety. The assessment also highlights the need for additional resources and services to address Leevi's specific needs, such as counseling and behavioral therapy.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Referral to counseling services: Arrange for Leevi to receive individual counseling sessions to address his emotional distress and develop coping strategies.
2. Behavioral therapy: Provide the Lappalaisen family with training and support to help manage Leevi's behavior and develop effective discipline techniques.
3. Ongoing monitoring: Schedule regular follow-up visits to monitor Leevi's progress, adjust the relocation plan as needed, and provide ongoing support to the foster family.
4. Family meetings: Organize bi-weekly family meetings to facilitate communication between Leevi, the Lappalaisen family, and social services.

Timeline for Further Visits:
* 10 May 2025: Follow-up visit to assess Leevi's progress and adjust the relocation plan as needed.
* 15 June 2025: Family meeting to discuss Leevi's behavior and develop a plan for addressing any emerging concerns.
