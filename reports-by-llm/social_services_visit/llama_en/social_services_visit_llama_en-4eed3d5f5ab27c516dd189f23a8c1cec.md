Social Services Visit Report

Date: 08.08.2024
Location: Ruovesi, Finland
Visit Type: Immigration case monitoring visit

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to monitor the well-being of the family at address [insert address], who are currently undergoing immigration case changes. The blended family has recently experienced custody changes, and it is essential to assess their living situation and provide support if needed.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival, I met with Mrs. Leena Kaurus (mother) and Mr. Juhani Laaksonen (father), who are co-parenting their two children, Aino (12) and Elias (9). The family appears to be adjusting to the recent custody changes, but there is a noticeable tension in the air. Both parents seem to be managing their emotions well, but the children appear slightly anxious.

The living conditions at the address are satisfactory, with adequate space for the family of four. However, there is some clutter and disorganization in the home, which may contribute to the tension. The kitchen and dining area are clean, but the bathroom could use some attention.

During our conversation, I observed that both parents are committed to co-parenting and prioritizing their children's well-being. They have established a routine for sharing parenting responsibilities and communicating effectively about their children's needs. However, there were moments of frustration and disagreement, which they acknowledged and expressed willingness to work through together.

Assessment:
Given the low case severity, it appears that the family is managing to cope with the recent custody changes. However, the tension and anxiety observed during the visit suggest that some support and guidance may be beneficial to help them navigate this challenging period. The family's commitment to co-parenting and prioritizing their children's well-being is commendable.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Referral to Family Counseling Services: I recommend referring Mrs. Kaurus and Mr. Laaksonen to a family counseling service that specializes in blended families and co-parenting. This will provide them with additional support and guidance to help them navigate their relationship and prioritize their children's well-being.
2. Home Safety Assessment: Due to the clutter and disorganization in the home, I suggest conducting a home safety assessment to identify any potential hazards or risks to the family's health and well-being.
3. Follow-up Visit: Schedule a follow-up visit in six weeks to assess the family's progress, provide ongoing support, and address any concerns that may have arisen.

Timeline for Further Visits:

* 06.09.2024: Follow-up visit to assess the family's progress and provide ongoing support
* 12.09.2024: Home safety assessment and completion of recommended actions
