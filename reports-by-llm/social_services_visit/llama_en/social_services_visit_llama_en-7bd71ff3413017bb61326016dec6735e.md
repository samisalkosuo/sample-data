Social Services Visit Report

Date: 15.10.2024
Location: Järvenpää, Finland
Visit Type: Post-hospital discharge visit

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to assess the well-being of the family following the hospital discharge of [Client Name], a 35-year-old female who has been experiencing symptoms related to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and anxiety. Given the history of chronic domestic violence within the household, it was essential to evaluate the safety and support environment for all family members.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, I observed [Client Name] exhibiting signs of emotional distress, including increased anxiety and agitation. The living conditions were satisfactory, with basic necessities provided. However, there were concerns regarding the cleanliness and organization of the home, which may be indicative of underlying stress and trauma. The family members, including two children aged 8 and 10, appeared to be adjusting to the situation but showed signs of increased anxiety and hypervigilance.

During our conversation, [Client Name] expressed feelings of guilt and shame regarding her experiences during the domestic violence incidents. She reported difficulty sleeping and experiencing flashbacks, which have worsened since her hospital discharge. The family members were supportive but seemed uncertain about how to provide adequate care and support for [Client Name]'s needs.

Assessment:
The situation appears moderate in terms of severity, with concerns regarding the emotional well-being of all family members. While basic necessities are met, there is a need for additional support to address the trauma and stress experienced by [Client Name]. The household dynamics suggest that the family may require guidance on coping strategies, stress management, and safety planning.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Referral to local counseling services: I recommended that [Client Name] attend individual and family therapy sessions to address her PTSD symptoms and develop coping strategies.
2. Safety planning: We discussed creating a safety plan with the family, including emergency contact numbers, safe rooms, and resources for support.
3. Home safety assessment: A home safety assessment will be conducted to identify potential hazards and provide recommendations for improving living conditions.
4. Follow-up visits: I scheduled follow-up visits every two weeks to monitor progress, provide ongoing support, and adjust the plan as needed.
