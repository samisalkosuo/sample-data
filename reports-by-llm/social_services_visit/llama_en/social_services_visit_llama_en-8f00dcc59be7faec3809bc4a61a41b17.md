Social Services Visit Report

Date: 08.06.2025
Location: Siilinjärvi, Finland
Visit Type: Refugee Integration Support Visit

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to assess the well-being and integration needs of a refugee family residing in temporary accommodation in Siilinjärvi. The family, consisting of parents, Amira and Khaled, and their two children, Ali and Leila, had been referred to our services due to concerns about their adaptation to Finnish society.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, I was greeted by Amira, who appeared anxious and overwhelmed. She expressed difficulties in navigating the local healthcare system and accessing essential services. The family's living conditions were satisfactory, with clean and well-maintained accommodation. However, there were signs of stress, including unopened mail and unwashed dishes.

During our conversation, Khaled seemed more composed but revealed concerns about his children's education and socialization. He expressed frustration with the lack of English language support in local schools and the limited availability of cultural activities for refugees. The children appeared shy and hesitant to engage in conversations, suggesting potential difficulties in integrating into Finnish society.

Assessment:
The family's situation is characterized as moderate, with several concerns that require attention. Amira's anxiety and Khaled's frustration are evident, while the children's integration challenges pose a significant risk to their long-term well-being. The family's language skills are limited, which may hinder their ability to access essential services and participate fully in Finnish society.

Notable concerns include:

* Limited English language proficiency
* Difficulty accessing healthcare and social services
* Insufficient cultural support for the children
* Anxious and overwhelmed parents

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
Based on my assessment, I recommend the following actions:

1. Language support: Arrange for a language course for Amira and Khaled to improve their English skills.
2. Healthcare access: Facilitate an appointment with a healthcare professional to address Amira's anxiety and provide guidance on accessing local services.
3. Education support: Identify local schools that offer English language support and cultural activities specifically designed for refugees.
4. Family counseling: Schedule a family counseling session to address the parents' concerns and provide emotional support.

Timeline:

* Language course: 6-8 weeks
* Healthcare appointment: within the next two weeks
* Education support: arrange with local schools within the next four weeks
* Family counseling: schedule for the following month

Next steps will be taken in consultation with Amira, Khaled, and other relevant stakeholders to ensure a comprehensive and supportive approach to their integration needs.
