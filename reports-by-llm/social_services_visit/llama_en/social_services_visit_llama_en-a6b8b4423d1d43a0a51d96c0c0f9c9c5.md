Location: Rantasalmi, Finland
Visit Type: Substance Abuse Support Visit

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to provide support and guidance to the young couple, Antti and Aino Laaksonen, as they prepare for the arrival of their first child. The visit aimed to assess their substance abuse situation, living conditions, and overall well-being in order to identify potential risks and provide necessary resources.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival at the Laaksonen residence ( address: Rantasalmi, 60600 Jyväskylä), I was greeted by Antti, who appeared anxious but cooperative. Aino was not present during the initial meeting, but she joined shortly after. The couple reported that they have been using cannabis and occasional alcohol in moderation since their relationship began. However, over the past few months, their consumption has increased, particularly on weekends.

The living conditions were satisfactory, with a clean and organized home environment. The couple's financial situation was stable, with Antti employed as a software engineer and Aino working part-time as a nurse. Notable concerns included the presence of empty beer cans and cannabis packaging in the trash, suggesting potential misuse.

During our conversation, Antti expressed feelings of guilt and anxiety about their substance use, which he attributed to increased stress due to the upcoming arrival of their child. Aino seemed more relaxed and downplayed her own consumption, stating that she only used substances "to unwind." However, when questioned further, she acknowledged that she had been feeling overwhelmed with work and personal responsibilities.

Assessment:
Given the low severity of this case, it is essential to acknowledge the couple's willingness to address their substance abuse concerns. The presence of empty packaging and increased consumption suggest a need for support and guidance. Antti's anxiety and feelings of guilt indicate a potential risk of escalation if left unaddressed.

Family dynamics appeared stable, with both partners expressing commitment to each other and their child. However, the couple's differing attitudes towards substance use may create tension in the future.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Referral to local counseling services for Antti and Aino to address their substance abuse concerns.
2. Invitation to a parenting class or support group to prepare them for parenthood.
3. Regular follow-up visits (every 6-8 weeks) to monitor progress, provide guidance, and offer additional resources as needed.

Timeline:
* Next visit: 02.23.2024
* Follow-up appointments: every 6-8 weeks until the child's birth

Conclusion:
This substance abuse support visit provided an opportunity for Antti and Aino Laaksonen to address their concerns and receive guidance on managing stress and substance use during this critical life transition. Regular follow-up visits will ensure that they continue to receive necessary support and resources to promote a healthy and stable environment for their child's well-being.
