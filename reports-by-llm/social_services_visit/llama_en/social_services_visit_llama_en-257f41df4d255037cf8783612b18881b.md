Social Services Visit Report

Date: 19 June 2025
Location: Lohja, Finland
Visit Type: Juvenile Probation Compliance Visit

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to assess the compliance of 15-year-old client, Aino Virtanen, with her probation conditions. As part of a multi-generational household facing financial difficulties, we aimed to evaluate the living situation and identify potential risks or concerns that may impact Aino's well-being.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival at the address, 12300 Lohja, Finland (Kirkonkyl√§nkatu 15), I was greeted by Aino's mother, Mrs. Virtanen. She appeared anxious and stressed, which may be related to the household's financial struggles. The living room was cluttered with unpaid bills and old newspapers, indicating a sense of disorganization. Aino was present during the visit but seemed hesitant to engage in conversation.

During our discussion, it became clear that Aino has been struggling academically due to lack of motivation. Her mother reported that Aino spends most of her free time on social media and watching TV, rather than pursuing extracurricular activities or helping with household chores. This behavior is concerning given the moderate case severity.

Assessment:
The assessment suggests that Aino's living situation poses a risk to her well-being due to the family's financial difficulties and lack of structure. The absence of clear boundaries and expectations within the household may contribute to Aino's disengagement from academic pursuits. Furthermore, the presence of multiple generations in the same household can create additional stress and pressure on individual members.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
Based on our findings, I recommend that Aino's mother participate in a financial counseling session at the local social services office to explore available resources for managing debt and improving the family's economic situation. Additionally, I suggest that Aino be referred to a school counselor to develop a plan to improve her academic performance.

To monitor progress, I propose scheduling follow-up visits every 6 weeks to assess Aino's compliance with probation conditions and provide support as needed. Furthermore, I will work with local schools to identify potential extracurricular activities or mentorship programs that can help Aino regain motivation and engagement in her studies.

Timeline for Further Visits:
- Next visit: 17 August 2025
- Follow-up visits: every 6 weeks until the end of the probation period (12 months)
