Social Services Visit Report

Date: 02.05.2025
Location: Hammarland, Finland
Visit Type: Disability Support Assessment

Summary of Visit Purpose:
This visit was conducted to assess the needs of the immigrant family residing at address 123 Kruununhaka, Hammarland, Finland. The purpose of this assessment is to evaluate the family's ability to provide adequate support and care for their member with a disability, ensuring their well-being and safety.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, I met with Mr. Ali Hassan, the father, and his wife, Mrs. Leila Hassan, who are both in their mid-40s. They appeared anxious and stressed, indicating that they have been experiencing difficulties adjusting to their new life in Finland. The family consists of four members: two children (ages 10 and 12) and Mr. Ali's brother, who has a moderate disability requiring ongoing support.

The living conditions were satisfactory, with adequate space for the family to reside comfortably. However, there were signs of clutter and disorganization, which may be indicative of stress and overwhelm. The family reported that they have been struggling to access local healthcare services due to language barriers and lack of familiarity with the Finnish healthcare system.

During our conversation, I observed that Mr. Ali was visibly frustrated with his brother's condition and expressed concerns about their ability to provide adequate care. Mrs. Leila appeared more composed but revealed that she has been shouldering a significant burden in terms of caregiving responsibilities. The children seemed withdrawn and hesitant to discuss their feelings or concerns.

Assessment:
Based on the observations during the visit, it is clear that this family is facing significant challenges in adapting to their new life in Finland. The mother's primary caregiver role may be exacerbating her own stress levels, while Mr. Ali's frustration with his brother's condition could lead to burnout and decreased ability to provide adequate support.

The case severity is moderate due to the presence of a disability requiring ongoing support, combined with the family's recent relocation and language barriers. However, it is essential to note that the family's resilience and adaptability are evident in their efforts to navigate these challenges.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Referral to local healthcare services for language support and cultural adaptation.
2. Connection with a Finnish-speaking social worker specializing in disability support to provide guidance on accessing resources and services.
3. Home visit within the next two weeks to assess the family's ability to implement recommended strategies and provide ongoing support.
4. Consideration of respite care services to alleviate Mrs. Leila's caregiving burden.

Timeline for Follow-up Visits:
- 02.19.2025: Initial home visit to assess implementation of recommendations
- 03.05.2025: Follow-up home visit to evaluate progress and adjust support plan as needed
