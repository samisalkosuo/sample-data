Social Services Visit Report

Date: 29.10.2024
Location: Laitila, Finland
Visit Type: Substance Abuse Support Visit

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to assess the situation of a separated couple with shared custody, who have been referred for substance abuse support due to concerns about their children's well-being and potential exposure to harmful substances. The visit aimed to evaluate the current living conditions, interactions between family members, and the level of support available to address the individual's substance use issues.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival at the residence, I observed a generally tidy and organized living space, with no signs of recent substance-related activity. However, upon further conversation, it became clear that both parents have been struggling with their own substance use issues, which has led to increased tension and conflict within the household.

The couple's interactions were strained, with both parties expressing frustration and resentment towards each other. The children (ages 8 and 10) seemed anxious and on edge, often avoiding eye contact or changing the subject when questioned about their parents' behavior. The parents reported that they have been using substances to cope with stress and emotional pain, but acknowledged that this has led to problems in their relationship and impact on their children's lives.

Assessment:
Given the moderate case severity, it is clear that both parents are struggling with substance use issues, which is affecting their ability to provide a stable and nurturing environment for their children. The household dynamics are strained, and there is a need for support and guidance to address these issues. However, it is also evident that both parents are willing to seek help and work towards recovery.

Notable concerns include the potential impact of substance use on the children's mental health and well-being, as well as the risk of exposure to substances in the home environment. It is essential to monitor the situation closely and provide ongoing support to ensure the family receives the necessary resources and guidance to address these issues.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Referral to a local substance abuse treatment center for both parents, with a focus on individualized therapy and support groups.
2. Arrangement of regular counseling sessions for the couple to work through their relationship dynamics and develop strategies for co-parenting.
3. Provision of parenting classes and workshops to educate the children about healthy relationships, boundaries, and coping mechanisms.
4. Ongoing monitoring of the household environment to ensure it is safe and free from substance-related hazards.
5. Follow-up visits scheduled every 6 weeks to assess progress, provide support, and make any necessary adjustments to the treatment plan.
