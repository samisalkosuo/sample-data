Social Services Visit Report

Date: 17 March 2025
Location: Kajaani, Finland
Visit Type: Domestic Violence Risk Assessment

Summary of Visit Purpose:
This visit was conducted to assess the risk of domestic violence in a shared housing situation involving two adult siblings, Ms. Aino Lehtonen and Mr. Eero Lehtonen, residing at 23 Kauppakatu, Kajaani, Finland. The purpose of this assessment is to identify potential risks and provide support to ensure the safety and well-being of both individuals.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, I observed a generally calm and respectful atmosphere within the shared housing unit. Ms. Lehtonen and Mr. Eero Lehtonen were present during my visit, and they provided information about their living situation. They reported that there have been occasional disagreements and arguments, but no incidents of physical or emotional abuse have occurred recently.

During our conversation, I noted that both siblings seem to be aware of the risks associated with domestic violence and are willing to seek help if needed. However, they also expressed some hesitation in discussing their personal issues due to concerns about being perceived as "weak" or "dependent." This reluctance may indicate a need for additional support and guidance on accessing resources.

The living conditions were found to be satisfactory, with basic amenities and minimal signs of disorganization. The kitchen and bathroom areas were clean, and the overall cleanliness of the unit was good. However, there were some minor issues with cluttered storage spaces and inadequate lighting in certain areas.

Assessment:
Based on my observations and discussions during the visit, I assess the situation as low-risk for domestic violence at this time. Both siblings appear to be aware of their rights and are willing to seek help if needed. However, it is essential to continue monitoring the situation and providing support to ensure that they have access to resources and guidance.

The family dynamics seem to be relatively stable, with both individuals maintaining a level of independence and respect for each other's boundaries. While there may be some underlying tensions or conflicts, these do not appear to be severe enough to warrant immediate intervention.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Schedule follow-up visits every 6 months to monitor the situation and provide ongoing support.
2. Refer Ms. Lehtonen and Mr. Eero Lehtonen to local counseling services to address any underlying issues or concerns.
3. Provide information about local resources, such as the Kajaani Domestic Violence Support Group, and encourage them to attend if needed.
4. Offer assistance with basic household tasks, such as cleaning and organization, to help alleviate some of the stress associated with living in a shared space.

Timeline for Further Visits:
The next scheduled visit will be on 17 September 2025, six months from the date of this report.
