Social Services Visit Report

Date: 07.05.2025
Location: Taivalkoski, Finland
Visit Type: Post-hospital discharge visit

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to assess the well-being of a woman recovering from domestic abuse following her hospital discharge. The visit aimed to evaluate her living conditions, emotional state, and potential risks associated with her situation.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival at the address, 12300 Taivalkoski, Finland (Kirkonkyl√§nkatu 10), I observed a woman, Ms. Aino Lehtonen, who appeared anxious and hesitant to engage in conversation. She seemed overwhelmed by the current living situation, which was cluttered and disorganized. The home lacked basic furniture, and essential items were either missing or in poor condition.

During our conversation, Ms. Lehtonen expressed fear of her former partner's visits and potential retaliation. She reported feeling isolated and without a support system. Her emotional state was characterized by anxiety, depression, and hypervigilance.

Notable concerns included the presence of unsecured firearms and sharp objects in the home, which posed a risk to Ms. Lehtonen's safety. Additionally, I observed signs of self-neglect, such as poor hygiene and malnutrition.

Assessment:
The situation is critical due to the ongoing risk of domestic violence and potential harm to Ms. Lehtonen. Her emotional state and living conditions indicate a high level of vulnerability. The lack of basic necessities and safety measures in the home exacerbates her situation.

Family dynamics are complex, with Ms. Lehtonen's former partner still present in the vicinity. This proximity poses a significant risk to her safety and well-being. It is essential to establish a safe distance between Ms. Lehtonen and her former partner to prevent further harm.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Immediate Referral: Arrange for emergency shelter services to provide Ms. Lehtonen with a safe place to stay.
2. Safety Plan Development: Collaborate with Ms. Lehtonen to create a comprehensive safety plan, including strategies for avoiding her former partner and accessing support services.
3. Firearms Disposal: Assist Ms. Lehtonen in disposing of firearms and sharp objects, ensuring her home is safe from potential harm.
4. Food and Hygiene Support: Provide Ms. Lehtonen with access to food banks and hygiene facilities to address self-neglect concerns.
5. Follow-up Visits: Schedule regular follow-up visits to monitor Ms. Lehtonen's progress, provide ongoing support, and adjust the safety plan as necessary.

Timeline for Further Visits:
- 14.05.2025: Initial follow-up visit to assess the implementation of the safety plan and provide ongoing support.
- 28.05.2025: Second follow-up visit to evaluate Ms. Lehtonen's progress and make any necessary adjustments to the safety plan.
