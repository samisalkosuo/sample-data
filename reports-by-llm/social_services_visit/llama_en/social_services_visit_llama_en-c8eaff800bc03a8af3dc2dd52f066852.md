Social Services Visit Report

Date: 18 January 2025
Location: Alavieska, Finland
Visit Type: Veteran support service check-in

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct a check-in with the veteran support services for the family residing at the address provided. The case severity is moderate, indicating that while the situation requires attention, it does not pose an immediate risk to the well-being or safety of the family members.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival, I met with Mrs. Leena Kaurusalo, a 25-year-old mother, and her infant child, who are living with their parents, Mr. and Mrs. Eero Kaurusalo, at the address provided. The household was tidy, but there were signs of recent stress, including unopened mail and unwashed dishes.

During our conversation, Mrs. Kaurusalo expressed feelings of overwhelm and anxiety related to her infant's care and her own lack of education and job skills. She mentioned that she is struggling to balance childcare responsibilities with the need to find employment. The parents displayed concern for their daughter-in-law's well-being but seemed uncertain about how to provide additional support.

Notable concerns included Mrs. Kaurusalo's limited access to healthcare services, as her family does not have a car and public transportation options are limited in Alavieska. Additionally, the infant's basic needs were being met, but there was a lack of stimulation and activities to promote healthy development.

Assessment:
The situation appears to be moderate due to the presence of a teenage mother with an infant living with her parents. While the family is facing challenges, they do not appear to be at risk of immediate harm or neglect. However, it is essential to monitor their situation closely to ensure that Mrs. Kaurusalo receives the necessary support and resources to become self-sufficient.

Family dynamics are complex, with the parents struggling to balance their own needs with those of their daughter-in-law. The mother's lack of education and job skills creates a significant barrier to her independence. It is crucial to provide guidance on accessing local employment services, vocational training, and healthcare support to help Mrs. Kaurusalo achieve stability.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Referral to local employment services: Arrange for Mrs. Kaurusalo to receive assistance with job placement and vocational training.
2. Healthcare access: Explore options for improving access to healthcare services, including transportation support and home visits by a healthcare professional.
3. Home visit schedule: Schedule regular home visits to monitor the infant's development and provide emotional support to Mrs. Kaurusalo.
4. Parenting classes: Recommend parenting classes or workshops to help the parents better understand their daughter-in-law's needs and provide additional support.

Timeline for Follow-up Visits:

* 02 February 2025: Home visit to assess infant's development and provide emotional support to Mrs. Kaurusalo.
* 16 March 2025: Follow-up meeting with employment services to monitor progress and provide guidance on job placement.
