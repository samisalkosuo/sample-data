Social Services Visit Report

Date: 10 January 2025
Location: Sonkaj채rvi, Finland
Visit Type: Support Plan Review Meeting

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct a review meeting with the multi-generational household in Sonkaj채rvi, as part of an ongoing support plan. The family has been experiencing financial difficulties and is facing moderate case severity. The visit aimed to assess the current situation, identify any changes or concerns, and discuss potential recommendations for further support.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, I met with Mrs. Maria Lehtonen, the matriarch of the household, who welcomed me warmly. She reported that the family has been struggling to make ends meet due to reduced income from her husband's job loss. The children, aged 12 and 15, are showing signs of stress and anxiety, while their grandmother, Mrs. Leena K채rkk채inen, is experiencing mobility issues.

During the meeting, I observed a sense of tension among family members, particularly between Maria and her adult son, Juhani. They discussed their financial situation and expressed concerns about their ability to pay bills on time. The children seemed hesitant to discuss their feelings, but Mrs. Lehtonen assured me that they are struggling in school due to the stress.

Assessment:
The assessment suggests that the family is facing significant challenges, including financial difficulties, stress, and anxiety. The moderate case severity indicates that while the situation is concerning, it does not require immediate intervention. However, ongoing support is necessary to address these issues and prevent further deterioration.

Family dynamics appear complex, with tensions between Maria and Juhani, as well as among the children. Mrs. Leena's mobility issues may exacerbate existing stressors. The family's living conditions are modest, but clean and well-maintained.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
Based on the assessment, I recommend the following:

1. Ongoing financial assistance: Continue to provide financial support to help the family manage their expenses.
2. Family counseling: Arrange for a family counseling session to address tensions and improve communication among family members.
3. Home care services: Explore options for home care services to support Mrs. Leena's mobility issues.
4. Educational support: Offer additional educational support for the children, including tutoring or online resources, to help them cope with stress and anxiety.

Next steps:

* Schedule a follow-up visit in 6 weeks to assess progress and adjust recommendations as needed.
* Refer Juhani to a job training program to enhance his employability.
* Arrange for a home care assessment to determine the level of support required for Mrs. Leena.

Timeline for further visits:

* Follow-up visit: 10 March 2025
* Review of family counseling progress: 20 April 2025
