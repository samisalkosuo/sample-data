Social Services Visit Report

Date: 28 December 2024
Location: Kauhajoki, Finland
Visit Type: Foster family evaluation
Case Severity: Low

Summary of Visit Purpose:
This visit was conducted as part of an ongoing foster family evaluation to assess the well-being and safety of the child living with their non-custodial relative in Kauhajoki. The purpose of this visit was to evaluate the current situation, interactions, and living conditions to determine if any changes or interventions are necessary to ensure the child's needs are met.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, I observed a warm and welcoming environment at the household address: 123 Kylpylaanen, Kauhajoki. The non-custodial relative, Ms. Maria Lehtonen, greeted me warmly and provided an overview of the child's daily routine and activities. The child, 8-year-old Emma, was present during the visit and appeared to be happy and engaged in play.

During our conversation, I noted that Ms. Lehtonen reported feeling overwhelmed with childcare responsibilities and occasional difficulties in managing Emma's behavior. However, she also expressed her commitment to providing a stable and loving environment for Emma. The living conditions were clean and tidy, with adequate space for the child to engage in activities.

Notable concerns raised during the visit included Ms. Lehtonen's limited access to social services and support networks, which may impact her ability to manage the child's needs effectively. Additionally, I observed that Emma occasionally exhibited signs of anxiety when discussing her parents' separation, highlighting the need for ongoing emotional support and guidance.

Assessment:
Based on my observations during this visit, it appears that Ms. Lehtonen is making a genuine effort to provide a stable and loving environment for Emma. However, the child's needs may require additional support and resources to ensure her well-being. The low case severity indicates that the situation is manageable with current support, but ongoing monitoring and adjustments will be necessary to address any emerging concerns.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
In light of this visit, I recommend:

1. Ongoing support for Ms. Lehtonen through social services, including access to counseling and respite care.
2. Regular check-ins with Emma to monitor her emotional well-being and provide guidance on managing anxiety related to her parents' separation.
3. Collaboration with local schools and educational institutions to ensure Emma receives necessary academic and social support.
4. Bi-monthly home visits to assess the child's needs and adjust support services as needed.

Timeline for further visits:

* 15 January 2025: Next scheduled visit to review progress and provide ongoing support
* 28 February 2025: Follow-up visit to assess Emma's emotional well-being and adjust support services accordingly
