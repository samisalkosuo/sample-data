Social Services Visit Report

Date: 30 January 2025
Location: Akaa, Finland
Visit Type: Domestic Violence Risk Assessment

Summary of Visit Purpose:
This visit was conducted to assess the risk of domestic violence in the household of Ms. Maria Lehtonen (hereinafter referred to as "the mother") and her newborn infant at her residence in Akaa, Finland. The visit aimed to evaluate the current living situation, interactions between the mother and her partner, and overall well-being of both individuals.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, I observed that Ms. Lehtonen was visibly anxious and on edge, constantly glancing over her shoulder as if expecting someone. She seemed hesitant to engage in conversation, but eventually opened up about her concerns regarding her partner's behavior. The newborn infant appeared healthy and well-cared for, with adequate nutrition and hygiene.

During the interview, it became apparent that Ms. Lehtonen had been experiencing emotional abuse and intimidation from her partner, which has led to feelings of isolation and fear. She reported instances of verbal aggression, possessiveness, and controlling behavior, which have made her feel trapped in the relationship. The mother also expressed concerns about the impact of domestic violence on their child's well-being.

Assessment:
Given the low severity of the case, it is essential to acknowledge that Ms. Lehtonen and her infant are currently safe and receiving basic necessities. However, the risk of escalation or further abuse cannot be ruled out without continued monitoring. The mother's emotional state and fear for her safety necessitate ongoing support and protection.

Recommendations:
Based on the assessment, I recommend the following:

1. Ongoing home visits to monitor the situation and provide emotional support to Ms. Lehtonen.
2. Referral to local domestic violence support services, including counseling and advocacy programs.
3. Collaboration with the Finnish Social Security Institution (Kela) to explore potential financial assistance for Ms. Lehtonen and her infant.
4. A follow-up visit within two weeks to reassess the situation and provide additional support as needed.

Timeline:
The next scheduled visit will be on 15 February 2025, unless otherwise indicated by Ms. Lehtonen or other relevant parties.

Conclusion:
This domestic violence risk assessment has identified a vulnerable individual in need of support and protection. Continued monitoring and intervention are necessary to ensure the safety and well-being of Ms. Lehtonen and her infant.
