Social Services Visit Report

Visit Date: 21.03.2025
Location: Kempele, Finland
Visit Type: Disability support assessment
Case Severity: Low

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct a disability support assessment for the household consisting of two adult siblings residing at the address provided. The assessment aimed to evaluate their living conditions, assess any potential risks or concerns, and provide recommendations for support services if needed.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival, I observed that the household was tidy and well-maintained, with no signs of neglect or abuse. The two adult siblings, Juhani Laaksonen (male, 28 years old) and Leena Laaksonen (female, 30 years old), were cooperative during the assessment. They provided information about their daily routines, living expenses, and any challenges they faced.

During our conversation, I noted that both siblings have a history of mild anxiety and depression, which they manage with medication and self-care practices. However, Juhani reported experiencing occasional episodes of fatigue and difficulty concentrating due to his disability. Leena expressed concern about her brother's well-being but stated that she is able to support him adequately.

The living conditions were satisfactory, with access to basic amenities such as food, water, shelter, and healthcare. The siblings' home was equipped with necessary assistive devices for Juhani's disability, which they had acquired through the Finnish social security system.

Assessment:
Based on the assessment, it appears that both siblings are capable of managing their daily lives with some support. However, Juhani's disability may require occasional assistance to ensure his well-being and independence. The low case severity suggests that there is no immediate risk to their safety or well-being.

Family dynamics were observed to be positive, with Leena taking on a supportive role towards her brother. Their cooperation and mutual understanding are essential in maintaining a stable living environment.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Regular check-ins: Schedule bi-monthly visits to monitor Juhani's condition and provide support as needed.
2. Assistive device maintenance: Ensure that the assistive devices provided by the Finnish social security system are regularly maintained and updated.
3. Mental health support: Encourage both siblings to continue their self-care practices and consider seeking additional mental health support if needed.

No referrals or emergency interventions were necessary during this visit. However, it is essential to maintain open communication with the siblings and monitor their situation closely to ensure that any potential issues are addressed promptly.

Next steps will be to schedule a follow-up visit in six months to reassess Juhani's condition and provide further support if needed.
