Social Services Visit Report

Date: 21 November 2024
Location: Lapua, Finland
Visit Type: Disability Support Assessment

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct a disability support assessment for the family residing at address 123 Koulukatu, Lapua, Finland. The referral was made due to concerns about the family's living situation and history of chronic domestic violence. Our primary objective was to assess the family's needs and provide guidance on available support services.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, I met with Mrs. Maria Lehtonen, a 35-year-old mother of two children, aged 7 and 9. She appeared anxious and hesitant during our initial conversation. The living conditions were satisfactory, with basic furniture and household items. However, there were signs of recent repairs and renovations, suggesting possible financial strain.

During the assessment, I observed that the children seemed to be coping well with their current situation, but they displayed occasional behavioral issues, possibly related to stress or anxiety. Mrs. Lehtonen reported difficulties in managing her daily routine due to chronic pain and fatigue. She also mentioned feeling isolated and lacking social support.

Notable concerns included the presence of unexplained bruises on Maria's arms and hands, which she attributed to accidents. However, I observed that these injuries seemed inconsistent with her account, and further investigation was warranted.

Assessment:
Given the family's history of chronic domestic violence and current living situation, there are significant risks to their well-being and safety. The case severity is classified as low due to the absence of immediate threats or severe physical harm. However, ongoing support and guidance are essential to prevent further escalation.

The family's disability needs were also identified, with Maria requiring assistance with daily tasks due to chronic pain and fatigue. Additionally, the children's behavioral issues may be related to their exposure to domestic violence.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Referral to local domestic violence support services for Maria and the children.
2. Coordination of a home visit by a social worker to assess the family's living situation and provide guidance on safety measures.
3. Arrangement of medical consultations for Maria to address her chronic pain and fatigue.
4. Support for the children through counseling sessions to address any emotional or behavioral issues related to their exposure to domestic violence.

Timeline:
- Follow-up visit: 5 December 2024
- Home visit by social worker: 10 December 2024
- Medical consultations for Maria: TBA

Conclusion:
This report highlights the need for ongoing support and guidance for the Lehtonen family. By addressing their disability needs, providing safety measures, and offering counseling services, we can help mitigate risks to their well-being and promote a more stable living situation.
