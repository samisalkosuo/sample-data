Social Services Visit Report

Date: 29 July 2025
Location: Siikainen, Finland
Visit Type: Parental Capacity Evaluation

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct a parental capacity evaluation for the household consisting of teenage mother, Aino Luukkainen (20 years old), and her infant child. The referral was made due to concerns regarding Aino's ability to provide adequate care and support for her child, as well as her living situation with her parents.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, I observed a warm and welcoming atmosphere in the household. Aino greeted me warmly and provided basic information about her child's needs and daily routine. The infant was seen playing with toys and interacting with Aino's mother, who was assisting with childcare duties. However, during our conversation, it became apparent that Aino struggles to manage her daily responsibilities, including household chores and meal preparation.

Aino's father, Juhani Luukkainen (45 years old), was present during the visit and appeared to be supportive of his daughter's parenting abilities. He offered assistance with childcare duties and provided basic financial support. However, it became clear that Aino relies heavily on her parents for emotional support and decision-making.

Notable concerns included Aino's limited access to education and employment opportunities, which may impact her ability to provide a stable environment for her child in the future. Additionally, the household's living conditions were found to be satisfactory, with adequate space and basic amenities.

Assessment:
Based on the observations during the visit, it appears that Aino is facing significant challenges in providing adequate care and support for her infant child. While she has a supportive family environment, her limited resources and lack of education may hinder her ability to provide long-term stability for her child. The moderate case severity indicates that while there are concerns, the situation is not critical at this time.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Referral to local employment services to explore opportunities for Aino's education and training.
2. Assistance with accessing government-funded childcare programs to support Aino's parenting responsibilities.
3. Regular home visits to monitor the household's living conditions and provide emotional support to Aino and her child.
4. Collaboration with Juhani Luukkainen to establish a plan for his financial support and involvement in childcare duties.

Timeline:
- Next home visit: 15 August 2025
- Follow-up appointment with local employment services: 10 September 2025
