Social Services Visit Report

Date: 10.05.2025
Location: Vehmaa, Finland
Visit Type: Mental Health Monitoring Visit

Summary of Visit Purpose:
This visit was conducted to assess the well-being of a family with a parent suffering from substance use disorder and their dependent children in Vehmaa, Finland. The purpose of this mental health monitoring visit is to evaluate the current situation, identify potential risks, and provide recommendations for support services to ensure the safety and well-being of all family members.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival at the residence, I observed a cluttered living environment with signs of disorganization and neglect. The parent, Mr. Antti Kärkkäinen, was seen engaging in erratic behavior, including frequent phone calls and messages to unknown numbers. He appeared disheveled and showed signs of fatigue, which may be related to his substance use disorder.

During the interview, Mr. Kärkkäinen expressed difficulty in managing his daily life due to his addiction. He reported feeling isolated and ashamed, which exacerbated his mental health issues. The children, aged 8 and 10, displayed signs of anxiety and fear, often hiding under their beds or seeking comfort from each other.

The living conditions were found to be substandard, with inadequate heating and poor sanitation facilities. The family's financial situation was also concerning, as they struggled to make ends meet due to Mr. Kärkkäinen's substance use-related expenses.

Assessment:
Given the critical case severity, it is evident that this family requires immediate support and intervention to prevent further deterioration of their well-being. The risks associated with Mr. Kärkkäinen's substance use disorder, including neglect of his children and potential harm to himself or others, necessitate a comprehensive response.

The family dynamics are complex, with the parent's addiction affecting not only his own life but also that of his dependent children. The children's emotional state is particularly concerning, as they require stable and nurturing care to thrive.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Immediate Referral: Mr. Kärkkäinen will be referred to a local substance abuse treatment center for inpatient rehabilitation.
2. Family Therapy: A family therapy session will be scheduled to address the complex dynamics within the household and provide guidance on coping strategies for all family members.
3. Child Welfare Services: The children's well-being will be closely monitored, and arrangements will be made for temporary foster care if necessary to ensure their safety and stability.
4. Financial Assistance: The family will be connected with local social services to access financial assistance programs and support with managing expenses related to Mr. Kärkkäinen's addiction.
5. Follow-up Visits: Regular follow-up visits will be scheduled to assess the family's progress, provide ongoing support, and make any necessary adjustments to their care plan.
