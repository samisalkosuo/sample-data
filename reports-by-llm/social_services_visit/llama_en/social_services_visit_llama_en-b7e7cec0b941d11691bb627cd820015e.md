Social Services Visit Report

Date: 24 January 2025
Location: Hailuoto, Finland
Visit Type: Safety Plan Monitoring Visit

Summary of Visit Purpose:
This visit was conducted to monitor the safety plan for [Client Name], a youth who is aging out of the foster system. The purpose of this visit was to assess the current living situation and ensure that the necessary support measures are in place to prevent harm or risk to the client.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival, I met with [Client Name] at their address, 123 Kyl√§ntie, Hailuoto, Finland. The youth appeared anxious and hesitant to discuss their living situation. However, they provided information about their daily routine, which included attending school and participating in local community activities.

During the visit, I observed that the client's living space was modest but clean and well-maintained. There were no signs of neglect or abuse. The client reported having a supportive network of family members and friends who live nearby.

However, during our conversation, [Client Name] expressed concerns about feeling isolated and struggling to cope with the transition from foster care to independent living. They mentioned that they are having difficulty finding employment and accessing local resources.

Assessment:
Based on my observations and discussions with [Client Name], I assess the situation as moderate in terms of risk. While there are no immediate safety concerns, the client's emotional state and lack of support systems pose a risk to their well-being. The client's ability to cope with the transition to independent living is uncertain, and further support is needed to ensure their safety and success.

Family Dynamics:
The client reported having a close relationship with their foster parents, who continue to provide emotional support and guidance. However, they also mentioned that they are struggling to establish independence and make decisions about their own life.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Referral to local employment services: I will refer [Client Name] to the Hailuoto Employment Office to access job training and placement services.
2. Support group attendance: I recommend that [Client Name] attend a support group for youth aging out of foster care, which is offered by the local social services department.
3. Regular check-ins: I will schedule regular check-ins with [Client Name] to monitor their progress, provide emotional support, and address any concerns or challenges they may face.
4. Family involvement: I will encourage the client's foster parents to continue providing guidance and support while respecting the client's independence.

Timeline for Further Visits:

* Next visit: 14 February 2025
* Follow-up visits: Every 2 weeks until [Client Name] has established a stable living situation and is making progress in their transition to independent living.

[Your Name]
