Social Services Visit Report

Date: 23.09.2024
Location: Rovaniemi, Finland
Visit Type: Homeless Outreach Visit

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct a homeless outreach assessment on behalf of the Social Services Department in Rovaniemi, Finland. The elderly man and his adult daughter were identified as being at risk due to their living situation, which was deemed moderate in severity.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival, I met with Mr. Juhani Kärkkäinen (age 75) and his daughter, Ms. Maria Kärkkäinen (age 42), at their residence located at Kauppatorinkatu 12, 96930 Rovaniemi. The living conditions were modest, with a small kitchen, one bedroom, and a shared bathroom. The apartment was clean, but the furniture was outdated, and there were signs of wear and tear.

During our conversation, Mr. Kärkkäinen expressed feelings of loneliness and isolation due to his wife's passing six months prior. Ms. Maria Kärkkäinen reported that her father had been struggling with depression since then and had become increasingly reclusive. She also mentioned that she was working full-time to support her father but was finding it challenging to balance work and caregiving responsibilities.

Notable concerns included Mr. Kärkkäinen's limited mobility, which made it difficult for him to leave the apartment without assistance. Ms. Maria Kärkkäinen expressed concern about her father's mental health and the potential risks of his isolation.

Assessment:
The situation appears to be moderate in severity due to the elderly man's depression, limited mobility, and lack of social interaction. The adult daughter is doing her best to care for her father, but the strain on her is evident. It is essential to provide support and resources to address Mr. Kärkkäinen's mental health needs and ensure his safety.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Referral to local mental health services: I will refer Mr. Kärkkäinen to the Rovaniemi Health Centre for depression treatment and counseling.
2. Home care support: The Social Services Department will provide home care support to assist with daily tasks, such as grocery shopping and light housekeeping.
3. Transportation assistance: We will explore transportation options to help Mr. Kärkkäinen access local services and social events.
4. Regular follow-up visits: I will schedule regular follow-up visits to monitor the situation and provide ongoing support.

Timeline for Further Visits:

* 30 days from today's visit: Follow-up visit to assess progress with mental health treatment and home care support.
* 60 days from today's visit: Review of transportation options and exploration of additional resources, such as adult day care services.
