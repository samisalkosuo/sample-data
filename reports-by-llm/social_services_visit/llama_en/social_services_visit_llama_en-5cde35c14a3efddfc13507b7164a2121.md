Social Services Visit Report

Date: 02.07.2025
Location: Hirvensalmi, Finland
Visit Type: Parenting Education Follow-up

Summary of Visit Purpose:
This visit was conducted as a follow-up to the parenting education program for families with a history of chronic domestic violence. The purpose of this visit is to assess the family's progress in addressing their relationship dynamics and to provide support and guidance to ensure a safe and stable environment for all family members.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival, I met with Mrs. Leena Kauriala (mother) and her partner, Mr. Juhani Laaksonen (father), at their residence in Hirvensalmi. The living conditions were generally satisfactory, with a clean and organized home environment. However, there were some signs of stress and tension during the conversation, particularly when discussing their relationship dynamics.

Mrs. Kauriala reported that they had been attending parenting classes together and had made progress in communicating more effectively and managing conflicts. Mr. Laaksonen acknowledged that he still struggled with controlling his temper, but was committed to working on this issue. The couple expressed appreciation for the support provided by the social services team and were eager to continue their education.

Notable concerns included Mrs. Kauriala's fear of being re-victimized if Mr. Laaksonen's anger issues worsened. She also reported feeling isolated from friends and family due to the ongoing domestic violence situation. I assured her that these concerns would be taken into consideration during future visits and that additional support services would be explored.

Assessment:
Based on the observations and discussions during the visit, it appears that the family is making progress in addressing their relationship dynamics. However, there are still risks associated with Mr. Laaksonen's anger issues, particularly if he experiences stress or triggers. The case severity is currently classified as low due to the absence of immediate threats or severe harm.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Continue to provide parenting education and support services for the couple.
2. Arrange a follow-up visit in 6 weeks to assess their progress and address any emerging concerns.
3. Explore additional support services, such as counseling for Mr. Laaksonen to address his anger issues, and group therapy for Mrs. Kauriala to address her feelings of isolation and re-victimization.
4. Consider referring the family to a local domestic violence support organization for ongoing guidance and resources.

Timeline:

* Next follow-up visit: 02.14.2025
* Additional support services to be explored: counseling for Mr. Laaksonen, group therapy for Mrs. Kauriala

Case Status:
The case is currently classified as low severity, with a focus on providing ongoing support and guidance to the family.
