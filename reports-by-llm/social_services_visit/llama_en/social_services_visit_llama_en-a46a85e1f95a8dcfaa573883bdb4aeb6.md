Social Services Visit Report

Date: 04.11.2024
Location: Alavus, Finland
Visit Type: At-risk youth intervention visit

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to assess the well-being and safety of single adult, Juhani Rantanen, who resides at his family home in Alavus, Finland. The visit was conducted as part of an ongoing at-risk youth intervention program due to concerns about Juhani's moderate case severity.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, I observed that Juhani was cooperative and welcoming during our conversation. He provided information about his daily routine, which included attending a local day center for individuals with intellectual disabilities. However, he expressed feelings of isolation and loneliness due to limited social interactions outside of the center.

The living conditions at the family home were found to be satisfactory, with basic amenities and necessary equipment for Juhani's care. The single adult caregiver reported that they had been struggling to provide adequate support and supervision due to their own health issues.

Notable concerns included Juhani's increasing reliance on technology for social interaction, which raised concerns about his digital literacy and potential vulnerability to online exploitation. Additionally, the caregiver expressed difficulties in managing Juhani's behavioral needs, particularly during periods of stress or anxiety.

Assessment:
Based on my observations and assessment, it is clear that Juhani faces significant challenges in maintaining a stable and fulfilling life due to his intellectual disability and limited social interactions. The moderate case severity indicates a need for ongoing support and intervention to prevent further deterioration.

The family dynamics were found to be strained, with the caregiver struggling to cope with their own health issues while providing care for Juhani. This has resulted in an uneven distribution of responsibilities, which may exacerbate the situation if not addressed.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
Based on my assessment, I recommend the following actions:

1. Referral to a local support group for caregivers of individuals with intellectual disabilities to provide them with respite and peer support.
2. Collaboration with the day center to develop strategies for increasing Juhani's social interactions and promoting his digital literacy.
3. Arrangement of regular home visits by a social worker to monitor Juhani's well-being, provide emotional support, and facilitate communication between the caregiver and relevant services.
4. Consideration of respite care options to alleviate the caregiver's health issues and ensure their ability to provide adequate support for Juhani.

Timeline:
The next follow-up visit is scheduled for 02.12.2024, at which time I will assess the implementation of recommended actions and provide further guidance as needed.
