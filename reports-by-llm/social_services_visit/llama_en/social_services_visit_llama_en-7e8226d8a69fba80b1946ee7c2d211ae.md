Social Services Visit Report

Date: 19 May 2025
Location: Kerava, Finland
Visit Type: Juvenile Probation Compliance Visit

Summary of Visit Purpose:
This visit was conducted to assess the compliance of 15-year-old client, Aino Virtanen, with her juvenile probation conditions. The case severity is classified as low, indicating a stable and supportive family environment.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival at the subsidized apartment located at Kauppakatu 12, Kerava, I was greeted by Aino's mother, Ms. Leena Virtanen. She provided me with a warm welcome and offered refreshments. The living conditions were clean and tidy, with no signs of neglect or disorganization.

During our conversation, Aino appeared relaxed and cooperative, answering questions about her daily routine, school performance, and extracurricular activities. Her mother reported that Aino has been maintaining good grades and participating in local sports teams. However, Ms. Virtanen expressed concern about Aino's occasional social media usage, which she believes may be affecting her academic focus.

The family dynamics were observed to be positive, with both parents actively involved in supporting Aino's education and well-being. The father, Mr. Pekka Virtanen, was present during the visit and engaged in conversation, demonstrating a supportive role model for his daughter.

Assessment:
Based on the observations during this visit, it appears that Aino is complying with her probation conditions and maintaining a stable home environment. However, the mother's concerns about social media usage warrant further monitoring to ensure Aino remains focused on her academic goals.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Schedule a follow-up visit in six months to assess Aino's continued compliance with her probation conditions.
2. Refer Ms. Virtanen to local counseling services to address any concerns she may have about Aino's social media usage and its impact on her well-being.
3. Maintain regular contact with Aino through phone calls or emails to ensure she remains engaged in her education and extracurricular activities.

Case Severity: Low

Next Steps:
This report will be filed and shared with relevant stakeholders, including the juvenile court and local authorities. Further updates will be provided as necessary to ensure the continued well-being and compliance of Aino Virtanen.
