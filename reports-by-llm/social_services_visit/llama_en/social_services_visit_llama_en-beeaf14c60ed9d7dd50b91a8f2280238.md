Social Services Visit Report

Date: 27 June 2025
Location: Jomala, Finland
Visit Type: Child Visitation Supervision Report

Summary of Visit Purpose:
This visit was conducted as part of an ongoing child protection case involving a 12-year-old unaccompanied minor residing in temporary housing in Jomala. The purpose of the visit was to assess the living conditions and interactions between the child and caregivers, with a focus on identifying potential risks and concerns that may impact the child's well-being.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival at the temporary housing facility, I observed the child, identified as Aino Luukkainen, 12 years old, in her room. She appeared anxious and reserved, avoiding eye contact during our initial interactions. The caregiver, Ms. Maria Lehtonen, was present but seemed distracted, preoccupied with her own tasks.

During the visit, I noted that the living conditions were basic, with limited access to recreational activities or educational resources. The child's room was small, with few personal belongings and no visible signs of comfort or relaxation. The kitchen area was clean, but the overall cleanliness of the facility was satisfactory.

Aino reported feeling lonely and isolated, with limited opportunities for social interaction outside of school hours. She expressed concerns about her future plans and aspirations, citing difficulties in accessing educational resources and support services tailored to her needs.

Assessment:
Given the high case severity, I assessed that Aino's situation poses significant risks to her emotional and psychological well-being. The lack of stable family dynamics, combined with limited access to resources and support services, creates a vulnerable environment for the child. Furthermore, Ms. Lehtonen's preoccupation and distraction during our interactions raised concerns about her ability to provide adequate care and supervision.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Immediate Referral: I recommend an immediate referral of Aino Luukkainen to the Finnish Child Welfare Services' specialized support program for unaccompanied minors.
2. Family Assessment: Conduct a comprehensive family assessment to determine the suitability of Ms. Lehtonen as a caregiver and provide recommendations for alternative care arrangements if necessary.
3. Educational Support: Arrange for Aino to receive educational support tailored to her needs, including access to online resources and tutoring services.
4. Regular Visits: Schedule regular visits with Aino every two weeks to monitor her well-being, provide emotional support, and address any concerns or issues that may arise.

Timeline:

* Within the next 48 hours: Arrange for an immediate referral of Aino Luukkainen to the Finnish Child Welfare Services' specialized support program.
* Within the next week: Conduct a comprehensive family assessment to determine the suitability of Ms. Lehtonen as a caregiver and provide recommendations for alternative care arrangements if necessary.
* Every two weeks: Schedule regular visits with Aino Luukkainen to monitor her well-being, provide emotional support, and address any concerns or issues that may arise.
