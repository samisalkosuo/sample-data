Social Services Visit Report

Date: 20 July 2025
Location: Reisjärvi, Finland
Visit Type: Routine family wellbeing visit
Case Severity: High

Summary of Visit Purpose:
This routine family wellbeing visit was conducted to assess the current situation and provide support to a young adult living alone in Reisjärvi. The case severity is high due to concerns about the individual's well-being and potential risks associated with their living circumstances.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival, I met with 22-year-old Emma Lehtonen at her address, 12300 Reisjärvi, Finland. Emma appeared nervous and fidgety during our initial conversation, which may be indicative of underlying emotional distress. She reported feeling isolated and struggling to cope with daily tasks due to mental health issues.

The living conditions were found to be satisfactory, with a clean and organized apartment. However, there were signs of disorganization in the kitchen, suggesting potential difficulties with meal preparation and time management. Emma's social interactions were limited, with no regular contact with family members or friends.

Emma's emotional state was characterized by anxiety and depression, which she reported exacerbating her daily struggles. She expressed feelings of hopelessness and despair, indicating a need for immediate support and guidance.

Assessment:
The assessment revealed a high level of vulnerability in Emma's situation, with potential risks to her physical and mental health. The case severity is justified due to the presence of significant emotional distress, social isolation, and difficulties with daily functioning.

Family dynamics were not explored in depth during this visit, as Emma reported no regular contact with family members or friends. However, it is essential to consider the possibility of underlying family issues that may be contributing to her current situation.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Referral to local mental health services: Emma will be referred to a local mental health clinic for assessment and treatment.
2. Support with daily living skills: A social worker will provide guidance and support to help Emma develop coping strategies and improve her daily functioning.
3. Regular follow-up visits: The next visit is scheduled for 10 August 2025, to monitor progress and adjust the support plan as needed.

Timeline:

* 20 July 2025: Initial assessment and referral to mental health services
* 10 August 2025: Follow-up visit to assess progress and adjust support plan
* Ongoing: Regular monitoring of Emma's situation and provision of ongoing support
