**Social Services Visit Report**

**Visit Date:** 22.07.2025
**Location:** Parkano, Finland
**Visit Type:** Juvenile Probation Compliance Visit
**Household Composition:** Unaccompanied minor in temporary housing
**Case Severity:** Urgent

**Summary of Visit Purpose:**
The purpose of this visit was to assess the compliance of 15-year-old client, Aino Virtanen, with her juvenile probation conditions. Following a recent incident involving substance use and truancy, concerns were raised regarding her safety and well-being in temporary housing.

**Observations During the Visit:**

Upon arrival at the temporary housing facility, I met with Aino, who appeared anxious and hesitant to engage in conversation. She reported that she had been struggling with stress and anxiety since moving to Parkano from Helsinki. Her living conditions were satisfactory, but she expressed concerns about the lack of recreational activities and social opportunities available in the area.

During our conversation, Aino revealed that she had been using cannabis on occasion, which was not in line with her probation conditions. She acknowledged the risks associated with substance use and expressed a desire to seek help and support. However, she also reported feeling isolated and disconnected from her peers, which may contribute to her substance use behavior.

**Assessment:**

The situation is urgent due to Aino's history of substance use and truancy. Her emotional state appears fragile, and she requires immediate support to address these issues. The temporary housing facility provides a stable environment, but it lacks the resources and structure necessary to support Aino's rehabilitation. It is essential to engage her in intensive counseling services and provide access to recreational activities and social opportunities.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up:**

1. **Intensive Counseling Services:** Arrange for Aino to receive individual and group counseling sessions with a trained therapist, focusing on substance use issues, stress management, and social skills development.
2. **Recreational Activities and Social Opportunities:** Collaborate with local organizations to provide Aino with access to recreational activities, sports, and social events that can help her connect with peers and build relationships.
3. **Family Involvement:** Attempt to establish contact with Aino's parents or guardians to discuss the situation and explore options for reunification or alternative care arrangements.
4. **Regular Progress Monitoring:** Schedule bi-weekly visits to monitor Aino's progress, provide support, and adjust the intervention plan as necessary.

**Timeline:**

* Next visit: 05.08.2025
* Follow-up with local organizations to arrange recreational activities and social opportunities: 03.08.2025

**Conclusion:**
Aino Virtanen requires immediate attention and support to address her substance use issues, stress, and emotional well-being. The proposed intervention plan aims to provide her with the necessary resources and structure to overcome these challenges and achieve a positive outcome.
