Social Services Visit Report

Visit Date: 03.12.2024
Location: Järvenpää, Finland
Visit Type: Social reintegration assessment
Case Severity: Low

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct a social reintegration assessment for the household consisting of two adult siblings, residing at address 123 Kruununhaka, 00520 Helsinki. The visit aimed to evaluate their living conditions, interactions, and overall well-being in light of their current situation.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, I was greeted by the two adult siblings, who were both cooperative during the assessment. They reported that they have been sharing housing for approximately six months due to financial constraints. The living conditions were generally satisfactory, with clean and organized premises. However, there were some signs of clutter and disorganization in certain areas.

During our conversation, I observed a positive and supportive relationship between the siblings. They shared household chores and cooking responsibilities, which seemed to be working well for them. Both individuals reported being employed part-time and receiving financial support from their parents. The siblings also mentioned that they have been attending local community events and participating in volunteer work, indicating an interest in reintegration into society.

Notable concerns during the visit included the siblings' limited access to healthcare services due to lack of insurance coverage. They also expressed difficulties in managing their finances, which led to occasional stress and anxiety.

Assessment:
Based on the observations and information gathered during the visit, it appears that the household is functioning relatively well, considering their current situation. The positive relationship between the siblings and their efforts to engage in community activities are notable strengths. However, the lack of access to healthcare services and financial management challenges pose some risks to their overall well-being.

Given the low case severity, it is recommended that the siblings continue to receive support from local community resources, such as counseling services and financial assistance programs. Regular follow-up visits will be necessary to monitor their progress and address any emerging concerns.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Referral to local healthcare services: The siblings should be encouraged to explore affordable healthcare options, such as public clinics or private insurance plans.
2. Financial assistance program enrollment: The siblings can benefit from financial assistance programs, such as the Finnish Government's unemployment benefits or local non-profit organizations offering financial support.
3. Regular follow-up visits: Scheduled visits will be conducted every two months to monitor the siblings' progress and address any emerging concerns.

Timeline for Further Visits:
The next scheduled visit will take place on 15.02.2025, two months from the date of this report.
