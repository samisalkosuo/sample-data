Social Services Visit Report

Date: 13.09.2024
Location: Pukkila, Finland
Visit Type: Post-hospital discharge visit

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to assess the well-being of Mr. Juhani Laaksonen, a rehabilitated ex-offender reintegrating into society after his hospital discharge. The visit aimed to evaluate his living conditions, interactions with family members, and overall situation to identify any potential risks or concerns.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival at the address, 23 Kruununhakaentie, Pukkila, I observed Mr. Laaksonen in a calm state of mind. He greeted me warmly and provided an overview of his daily routine, which included attending counseling sessions and participating in local job training programs. His family members, consisting of his wife, Maria, and two children, were present during the visit.

The living conditions at the address appeared satisfactory, with clean and well-maintained furniture and appliances. However, there were some signs of clutter, particularly in the children's play area. The family reported that they had been struggling to manage their finances, but were making efforts to improve their financial situation through budgeting and cost-cutting measures.

Notable concerns during the visit included Mr. Laaksonen's occasional mood swings, which he attributed to stress related to his job search. His wife, Maria, expressed concern about the impact of these mood swings on the family dynamics, particularly with regards to the children's emotional well-being.

Assessment:
Based on the observations and discussions during the visit, it appears that Mr. Laaksonen is making progress in his rehabilitation and reintegrating into society. However, there are some concerns regarding his mental health and the potential impact of these issues on the family dynamics. The low case severity suggests that the situation is manageable with support and guidance.

Family dynamics:
The family's relationship appears to be stable, with both parents actively involved in their children's care and well-being. However, there were some signs of tension during the visit, particularly when discussing Mr. Laaksonen's mood swings. It is essential to monitor these interactions closely to ensure that the family receives adequate support.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
Based on the assessment, I recommend the following:

1. Regular counseling sessions for Mr. Laaksonen to address his mental health concerns and develop coping strategies.
2. Referral to a local financial advisor to assist with budgeting and cost-cutting measures.
3. Ongoing support for Maria, who may benefit from individual counseling sessions to address her concerns about the family dynamics.
4. Regular home visits to monitor the living conditions and provide guidance on maintaining a clean and organized environment.

Timeline:
The next visit is scheduled for 20.10.2024, six weeks after this report. I will also conduct regular phone calls with Maria to ensure that she receives adequate support and guidance.
