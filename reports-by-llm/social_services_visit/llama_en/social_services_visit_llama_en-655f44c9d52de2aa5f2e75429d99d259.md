Social Services Visit Report

Visit Date: 21.08.2024
Location: Kemiönsaari, Finland
Visit Type: Routine family wellbeing visit
Household Composition: Child living with non-custodial relative
Case Severity: Moderate

Summary of Visit Purpose:
This routine family wellbeing visit was conducted to assess the current situation and dynamics within the household, focusing on the child's well-being and safety. Given the moderate case severity, the primary objective was to identify potential risks or concerns that may require further intervention.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival at the address, 123 Kemiönsaari, Kemiönsaari, Finland (Kemijärvi), I observed a calm and peaceful environment. The child, Aino Lehtinen (age 7), was playing in the living room with her non-custodial relative, Mr. Pekka Rantala. Both parties appeared to be engaged in a positive interaction, with Aino laughing and smiling during their playtime.

During our conversation, I noted that Mr. Rantala reported being a single parent since Aino's parents' separation two years ago. He stated that he has been doing his best to provide for Aino's needs and ensure her emotional well-being. However, he acknowledged feeling overwhelmed at times due to financial constraints and the added responsibility of caring for Aino alone.

Aino herself seemed happy and content during our conversation, sharing stories about her favorite activities and friends from school. Her emotional state appeared stable, but I did notice a slight hesitation when discussing her parents' separation, indicating potential unresolved emotions or concerns.

Notable Concerns:

* Mr. Rantala's financial situation appears precarious, with limited income and increasing expenses for childcare and household necessities.
* Aino's emotional well-being is currently stable, but ongoing support and monitoring are necessary to address any potential long-term effects of her parents' separation.
* The living conditions, while clean and tidy, could benefit from some minor improvements, such as additional storage space or a more organized layout.

Assessment:
The current situation appears manageable, with Mr. Rantala doing his best to provide for Aino's needs. However, the moderate case severity warrants ongoing monitoring and support to address potential risks, such as financial instability and emotional well-being concerns. It is essential to continue providing guidance and resources to ensure Aino's continued safety and well-being.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

* Schedule a follow-up visit in six months to assess Mr. Rantala's financial situation and provide ongoing support.
* Arrange for additional counseling sessions for Aino, focusing on her emotional well-being and coping strategies related to her parents' separation.
* Offer assistance with household organization and minor renovations to improve living conditions.
* Provide referrals to local resources, such as food banks or financial assistance programs, to support Mr. Rantala's financial stability.

Timeline:

* Follow-up visit: 21.02.2025
* Additional counseling sessions for Aino: Ongoing, with a minimum of two sessions per month
