Social Services Visit Report

Date: 19 November 2024
Location: Eckerö, Finland
Visit Type: Youth Mentoring Program Assessment

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to assess the suitability of a youth mentoring program for a single adult with intellectual disability residing in Eckerö, Finland. The case severity is classified as urgent due to concerns regarding the individual's well-being and potential risks associated with their living situation.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival at the address, 12345 Kustavinkatu, Eckerö, I observed a single adult male, identified as Juhani Laaksonen, who has been receiving support services for intellectual disability. The individual was cooperative during the visit and provided information about his daily routine, living arrangements, and social interactions.

The living conditions at the address were found to be satisfactory, with basic necessities such as food, clothing, and hygiene facilities being met. However, there were concerns regarding Juhani's ability to manage his finances independently, which may lead to potential risks of exploitation or financial instability.

During the visit, I observed Juhani engaging in self-directed activities, including watching television and browsing online content. He also reported feeling isolated and lacking social interaction, which was a concern given the case severity.

Assessment:
The assessment revealed that Juhani's intellectual disability and living situation pose significant risks to his well-being. The individual requires ongoing support and guidance to ensure his safety and prevent potential harm. The youth mentoring program may be beneficial in addressing Juhani's social isolation and providing him with opportunities for skill development and emotional support.

However, further assessment is required to determine the suitability of the program for Juhani's specific needs and circumstances. It is essential to consider the individual's capacity for participation, potential risks associated with group settings, and the availability of support services in Eckerö.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Referral to a multidisciplinary team for further assessment and planning.
2. Invitation for Juhani to participate in a needs assessment to determine his suitability for the youth mentoring program.
3. Arrangement of regular home visits to monitor Juhani's well-being and provide ongoing support.
4. Collaboration with local organizations to explore alternative support services that may be more suitable for Juhani's specific needs.

Timeline:

* Within the next two weeks, a multidisciplinary team will conduct a comprehensive assessment of Juhani's needs and develop a plan for his support.
* Regular home visits will commence within four weeks to monitor Juhani's well-being and provide ongoing support.
* The youth mentoring program will be evaluated in six months to determine its suitability for Juhani's participation.
