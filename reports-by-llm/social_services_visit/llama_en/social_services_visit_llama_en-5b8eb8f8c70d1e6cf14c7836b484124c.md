Social Services Visit Report

Date: 18 March 2025
Location: Espoo, Finland
Visit Type: Routine family wellbeing visit
Case Severity: Low

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this routine family wellbeing visit was to assess the current situation and living conditions of the young couple, Antti and Sofia, expecting their first child. The visit aimed to identify any potential risks or concerns that may impact the well-being of the family.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival at the address, 23 Kruununhakaentie, Espoo, I observed a clean and tidy living environment. Antti and Sofia welcomed me warmly and provided information about their daily routines, including their work schedules and childcare arrangements. They expressed excitement about the upcoming arrival of their child and discussed plans for setting up a nursery.

During our conversation, I noted that both partners were engaged and enthusiastic about their roles as parents-to-be. However, they did mention some concerns regarding financial stability and access to healthcare services in Espoo. Antti mentioned having limited knowledge about local parenting groups and support services available for new families.

Assessment:
Based on the observations during the visit, I assessed that the family's situation is generally stable, with no immediate risks or concerns identified. However, it was noted that they may benefit from some guidance on accessing local resources and support services to ensure a smooth transition into parenthood.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Provide information about local parenting groups and support services available in Espoo.
2. Offer assistance with registering for healthcare services and accessing relevant benefits.
3. Schedule a follow-up visit in 6-8 weeks to review the family's progress and provide ongoing support.

No referrals were necessary at this time, as the situation is deemed low-risk. However, it was recommended that Antti and Sofia take advantage of local resources and support services to ensure their well-being and that of their child.

Case Notes:
The case will be closed for now, with a follow-up visit scheduled in 6-8 weeks to review progress. Further action will be taken if any concerns or risks arise during this period.
