Date: 07.02.2025
Location: Ikaalinen, Finland
Visit Type: Veteran support service check-in

Summary of Visit Purpose:
This visit was conducted as part of a routine check-in for veteran residents in transitional housing post-rehabilitation at the Ikaalinen Social Services Office. The purpose of this visit was to assess the well-being and progress of the resident, Antti K채rkk채, who has been receiving support services since his return from military service.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, I observed Antti in a calm and cooperative state, engaged in conversation with the social worker. He reported feeling supported by the transitional housing program and expressed gratitude for the ongoing assistance. The living conditions were satisfactory, with clean and well-maintained facilities. However, there was some concern regarding Antti's limited engagement in recreational activities, which he attributed to his struggles with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

Assessment:
Given the low case severity, the overall situation appears stable, with Antti making progress in his recovery. However, it is essential to continue monitoring his mental health and provide ongoing support to address any emerging concerns. The social worker noted that Antti's PTSD symptoms are manageable but may require additional interventions to prevent exacerbation.

Notable Concerns:
- Limited engagement in recreational activities
- Potential for PTSD symptom flare-ups if not addressed

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Schedule a follow-up visit within the next six weeks to assess Antti's continued progress and adjust support services as needed.
2. Refer Antti to a local mental health organization specializing in PTSD treatment, with the goal of providing additional support and resources for his ongoing recovery.
3. Encourage Antti to participate in recreational activities, such as sports or hobbies, to promote socialization and stress relief.

Timeline:

* Follow-up visit: 06.03.2025
* Referral to mental health organization: TBA (to be determined)

Conclusion:
This visit confirmed that Antti K채rkk채 is making progress in his recovery from military service-related issues. Continued support and monitoring will ensure the stability of his situation, allowing him to reintegrate into society with minimal disruption.
