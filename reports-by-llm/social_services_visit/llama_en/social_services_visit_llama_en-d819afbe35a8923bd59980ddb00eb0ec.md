Social Services Visit Report

Date: 29 July 2025

Location: Loimaa, Finland

Visit Type: Parenting Education Follow-up

Case Number: SES-2023-0012

Client Information:
Name: Antti Kauriala
Address: Keskuskatu 12, 22900 Loimaa, Finland

Summary of Visit Purpose:
This visit was conducted as part of a parenting education follow-up for Antti Kauriala, a rehabilitated ex-offender reintegrating into society. The purpose of the visit was to assess the current situation and provide support to ensure the well-being of his child(ren) and overall family dynamics.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, I observed Antti in a calm state, but slightly anxious about the upcoming school year for his children. He reported that he had been struggling with managing his temper and finding ways to cope with stress. The living conditions at the address were satisfactory, with basic furniture and household items. However, there was evidence of some disorganization, particularly in the child's play area.

During our conversation, Antti expressed concerns about his ability to provide a stable environment for his children due to his past experiences. He acknowledged that he had been attending parenting education sessions regularly but felt overwhelmed by the demands of parenthood. Notable concerns included:

* Antti's history of substance abuse and its potential impact on his child's well-being
* His struggles with managing stress and anger, which could affect his ability to provide a safe environment for his children
* The lack of support systems in place for Antti, particularly during times of crisis

Assessment:
The situation appears urgent due to the high risk of harm to Antti's children if he is unable to manage his emotions and behaviors effectively. The family dynamics are complex, with Antti struggling to balance his past experiences with his responsibilities as a parent. It is essential to provide ongoing support and guidance to help Antti develop coping strategies and build a more stable environment for his children.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Referral to a local counseling service specializing in trauma-informed care for ex-offenders.
2. Collaboration with the Finnish Social Security Institution (Kela) to explore potential financial assistance programs for Antti's family.
3. Regular follow-up visits every 6 weeks to monitor progress, provide support, and adjust the intervention plan as needed.
4. Consideration of a home visit program to provide additional support and guidance on managing stress and anger.

Timeline:
* Next follow-up visit: 12 August 2025
* Review of Antti's progress: 15 September 2025
