**Social Services Visit Report**

**Visit Date:** 13.08.2024
**Location:** Savonlinna, Finland
**Visit Type:** Veteran support service check-in
**Household Composition:** Cohabiting couple with mental health challenges
**Case Severity:** High

**Summary of Visit Purpose:**
The purpose of this visit was to conduct a check-in on the veteran support services for Mr. and Mrs. Kauriala, a cohabiting couple residing in Savonlinna, Finland. The visit aimed to assess their current situation, provide emotional support, and identify potential risks or concerns that may require further intervention.

**Observations During the Visit:**
Upon arrival, I observed that the couple was struggling to manage their daily routines due to their mental health challenges. They reported feeling overwhelmed and isolated, with limited social interaction outside of their home. The living conditions were modest, with some signs of disorganization and clutter. However, the overall cleanliness and safety of the premises appeared satisfactory.

During our conversation, I noticed that Mr. Kauriala exhibited increased anxiety and agitation, while Mrs. Kauriala displayed more subdued emotions. They both reported feeling frustrated with their lack of progress in addressing their mental health issues. The couple expressed a desire for additional support and guidance to manage their symptoms and improve their overall well-being.

**Assessment:**
The assessment revealed a high level of risk due to the couple's severe mental health challenges, which were impacting their daily lives and relationships. The cohabiting arrangement was also a concern, as it may be exacerbating their emotional distress. Furthermore, the lack of social interaction and support networks outside of their home was evident.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up:**
Based on the assessment, I recommend the following:

1. **Referral to Mental Health Services:** Arrange for an immediate referral to a specialized mental health service in Savonlinna, focusing on couples therapy and individual counseling.
2. **Home Safety Assessment:** Conduct a home safety assessment to identify potential hazards and provide recommendations for modifications or adaptations to ensure a safe living environment.
3. **Social Support Network Development:** Encourage the couple to participate in local social activities and support groups, aiming to establish a network of friends and acquaintances who can provide emotional support and practical assistance.
4. **Follow-up Visits:** Schedule regular follow-up visits (every 6-8 weeks) to monitor progress, address emerging concerns, and adjust the support plan as needed.

**Next Steps:**
The social services team will work closely with the couple to implement these recommendations and ensure their continued well-being. Further updates and progress reports will be provided in subsequent visit reports.
