Social Services Visit Report

Date: 18 November 2024
Location: Multia, Finland
Visit Type: Parental Capacity Evaluation
Case Severity: Moderate

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct a parental capacity evaluation for the separated couple, Juhani and Maria Lehtonen, with shared custody arrangements. The visit aimed to assess the current living situation, interactions between the parents, and overall well-being of the children.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival at the family's residence in 23 Koulukatu, Multia, I observed a generally calm atmosphere. Juhani and Maria Lehtonen were present during my visit, and they provided information about their daily routines, childcare responsibilities, and any concerns they may have regarding co-parenting.

The living conditions of the residence appeared to be satisfactory, with adequate space for the two children (ages 7 and 9). However, I noted some clutter in the play areas, which could potentially pose a tripping hazard. The parents acknowledged this issue and expressed their intention to organize a cleaning session together.

During our conversation, Juhani and Maria demonstrated a generally cooperative attitude towards shared custody. They discussed their schedules, transportation arrangements, and communication methods for making decisions regarding the children's care. However, there were moments of tension when discussing past conflicts and disagreements.

The emotional state of both parents appeared to be stable, with no apparent signs of acute distress or anxiety. Nevertheless, I observed some subtle cues suggesting that they may still be struggling with the aftermath of their separation.

Assessment:
Based on my observations during this visit, it appears that Juhani and Maria Lehtonen are making an effort to co-parent effectively despite their past conflicts. The shared custody arrangement seems to be working relatively smoothly, with both parents taking turns caring for the children. However, I noted some areas of concern, such as the need for improved communication and conflict resolution strategies.

The moderate case severity suggests that while there are some challenges to overcome, the situation is not currently posing an immediate risk to the well-being or safety of the children. Further monitoring and support may be necessary to ensure the long-term stability of this arrangement.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Schedule a follow-up visit in 6 months to assess the continued effectiveness of the shared custody arrangement.
2. Refer Juhani and Maria Lehtonen to a family counseling service to develop improved communication and conflict resolution skills.
3. Provide guidance on organizing a cleaning schedule and maintaining a clutter-free environment for the children's play areas.

Timeline:

* Follow-up visit: 18 May 2025
* Family counseling sessions: To be arranged within the next 2 months
