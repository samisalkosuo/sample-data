Social Services Visit Report

Date: 09.04.2025
Location: Virolahti, Finland
Visit Type: Support plan review meeting

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct a support plan review meeting for the separated couple with shared custody, as per the scheduled appointment. The visit aimed to assess the current situation, identify any changes or concerns, and provide guidance on maintaining a stable and supportive environment for the children.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival at the residence, I observed that the living conditions were generally satisfactory, with adequate space for the family of three. However, there was evidence of clutter in certain areas, which may require attention to maintain a clean and organized home environment. The parents, Juhani and Sari, greeted me warmly and provided an update on their co-parenting efforts.

During our discussion, it became clear that both parents were committed to maintaining open communication and cooperation regarding the children's needs. They shared their concerns about the recent increase in stress related to work and personal responsibilities. I noted that they had been using a shared online calendar to coordinate schedules and activities, which seemed to be effective in managing the children's daily routines.

However, there were some notable concerns raised during our conversation. Juhani reported feeling overwhelmed with childcare duties, while Sari expressed frustration with Juhani's lack of involvement in household chores. These tensions highlighted the need for continued communication and compromise to avoid conflict and ensure a stable environment for the children.

Assessment:
Based on my observations and discussions during the visit, I assessed that the situation remains moderate in terms of risk. While there are some concerns regarding co-parenting dynamics and stress levels, both parents appear committed to prioritizing the children's well-being. The shared custody arrangement seems to be working relatively smoothly, with the use of a shared online calendar facilitating coordination.

However, it is essential to continue monitoring the situation and providing support to address any emerging issues. Regular communication between Juhani and Sari will be crucial in maintaining open lines of communication and resolving conflicts in a constructive manner.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Schedule regular check-ins with both parents to monitor their co-parenting efforts and provide guidance on managing stress and conflict.
2. Refer Juhani to local parenting support groups, which may help him develop strategies for managing childcare responsibilities and reducing feelings of overwhelm.
3. Encourage Sari to explore local resources for household management and organization, as the clutter in certain areas may be contributing to her stress levels.
4. Schedule a follow-up visit within six weeks to assess the effectiveness of these recommendations and provide further support as needed.
