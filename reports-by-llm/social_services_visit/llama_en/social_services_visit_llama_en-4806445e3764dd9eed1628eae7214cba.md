Social Services Visit Report

Visit Date: 02.10.2024
Location: Kankaanpää, Finland
Visit Type: Post-abuse recovery support visit
Household Composition: Young adult living alone
Case Severity: Moderate

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to provide post-abuse recovery support to a young adult who has experienced domestic violence. The visit aimed to assess the individual's well-being, living conditions, and safety, as well as identify potential risks and areas for improvement.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival at the address, 12300 Kankaanpääntie 10, Kankaanpää, Finland, I observed that the young adult, Ms. Aino Virtanen, was visibly shaken but cooperative during our conversation. She reported experiencing physical and emotional abuse from her partner over the past six months. Ms. Virtanen seemed hesitant to discuss specific details of the abuse, but provided a general account of feeling trapped and isolated in the relationship.

The living conditions at the address were found to be satisfactory, with basic necessities such as food, water, and hygiene facilities available. However, there were signs of emotional distress, including unopened letters from the partner and scattered personal belongings that suggested ongoing conflict. Ms. Virtanen reported feeling anxious and on edge when her partner was not present.

Assessment:
Based on the information gathered during this visit, it appears that Ms. Virtanen is at moderate risk for further harm due to the ongoing nature of the abuse. Her emotional state suggests a need for continued support and protection from potential re-abuse. The household dynamics indicate a power imbalance, with the partner exerting control over Ms. Virtanen's daily life.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Referral to local domestic violence support services: I will provide Ms. Virtanen with information about local organizations offering counseling, advocacy, and practical assistance for survivors of domestic violence.
2. Safety planning: Together, we will develop a safety plan to ensure Ms. Virtanen's immediate safety and well-being. This may include temporary accommodation arrangements or other protective measures.
3. Follow-up visits: I recommend scheduling regular follow-up visits (every 4-6 weeks) to monitor Ms. Virtanen's progress, provide ongoing support, and assess any changes in her situation.
4. Collaboration with local authorities: If necessary, I will contact local law enforcement or social services to report potential threats or concerns related to the abuse.

Timeline for Further Visits:
The next scheduled visit is 04.03.2024, at which time we will reassess Ms. Virtanen's situation and provide ongoing support.
