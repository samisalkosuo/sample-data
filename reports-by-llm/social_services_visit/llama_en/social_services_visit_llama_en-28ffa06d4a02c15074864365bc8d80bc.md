**Social Services Visit Report**

**Visit Date:** 05.06.2025
**Location:** Keuruu, Finland
**Visit Type:** Safety Plan Monitoring Visit

**Summary of Visit Purpose:**
The purpose of this visit was to monitor the safety plan implemented for single father, Juhani Rissanen, and his child, Aino (8 years old), following a critical case assessment. The visit aimed to assess the effectiveness of the safety plan in ensuring the well-being and protection of both family members.

**Observations During the Visit:**
Upon arrival at the residence located at Keskuskatu 12, Keuruu, I observed Juhani and Aino in a calm state. However, during our conversation, it became apparent that Juhani was struggling to cope with the stress of managing daily responsibilities alone. He expressed feelings of overwhelm and anxiety regarding his ability to provide for Aino's needs.

The living conditions were satisfactory, with adequate food, clothing, and basic necessities available. However, I noted some signs of neglect, such as dirty dishes piling up in the kitchen and a lack of organization in the child's room. Juhani acknowledged these issues but stated that he was struggling to maintain a routine due to his own emotional state.

During our interaction, Aino seemed hesitant to engage in conversation, suggesting that she might be experiencing some emotional distress. Juhani assured me that they were both doing their best, but I observed some signs of tension between them, particularly during moments when Aino expressed frustration or disappointment.

**Assessment:**
Given the critical case severity and ongoing stressors, my assessment is that the safety plan implemented thus far has not adequately addressed Juhani's emotional well-being. The lack of support services and resources for single fathers in Keuruu has likely exacerbated his feelings of isolation and overwhelm.

The household dynamics appear to be strained, with Aino potentially being a vulnerable child in need of additional protection and care. I am concerned that if the situation is not addressed promptly, it may lead to further emotional distress and potential harm to both Juhani and Aino.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up:**
Based on my assessment, I recommend the following:

1. **Referral to local support services:** Arrange for Juhani to receive counseling sessions with a trained therapist specializing in single father support groups.
2. **Case management:** Assign a social worker to work closely with Juhani and Aino, providing guidance on managing daily responsibilities, accessing community resources, and addressing emotional well-being.
3. **Home visit schedule:** Schedule regular home visits (bi-weekly) to monitor the household's progress, provide support, and address any emerging concerns.
4. **Child protection assessment:** Request a comprehensive child protection assessment to determine if Aino is at risk of harm or neglect.

**Timeline for Follow-up:**
The next scheduled visit will be on 19.06.2025, with bi-weekly home visits to follow thereafter. I will also schedule regular check-ins with Juhani and Aino to monitor their progress and provide ongoing support.
