**Social Services Visit Report**

**Visit Date:** 30.07.2025
**Location:** Muonio, Finland
**Visit Type:** Veteran support service check-in
**Household Composition:** Rehabilitated ex-offender reintegrating into society
**Case Severity:** High

**Summary of Visit Purpose:**
The purpose of this visit was to conduct a check-in with Mr. Antti Kärkkäinen, a rehabilitated ex-offender who is reintegrating into society in Muonio, Finland. As part of the veteran support service, our team aimed to assess his current situation, provide emotional support, and identify potential risks or concerns that may require further intervention.

**Observations During the Visit:**
Upon arrival at Mr. Kärkkäinen's residence, located at Pudasjärvenkatu 12, Muonio, I observed a generally calm and cooperative demeanor. However, during our conversation, he expressed feelings of isolation and difficulty in adjusting to civilian life after serving in the Finnish military. He reported struggling with sleep disturbances and experiencing flashbacks related to his military service.

Mr. Kärkkäinen's living conditions were found to be satisfactory, with a clean and organized home environment. However, I noted that he was in need of assistance with grocery shopping and meal preparation due to mobility issues stemming from his military injuries.

**Assessment:**
Given the high case severity, it is evident that Mr. Kärkkäinen requires ongoing support to address his emotional and practical needs. The risk of relapse into criminal behavior or exacerbation of mental health symptoms is present if he does not receive adequate support. Furthermore, his isolation and difficulty in adjusting to civilian life may lead to further deterioration of his mental health.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up:**
Based on the assessment, I recommend the following:

1. **Ongoing counseling sessions:** Arrange for regular counseling sessions with a licensed therapist specializing in veteran support services to address Mr. Kärkkäinen's emotional and psychological needs.
2. **Assistance with daily living tasks:** Provide referrals to local organizations offering assistance with grocery shopping, meal preparation, and other daily living tasks to alleviate his mobility issues.
3. **Social integration activities:** Encourage participation in social integration activities, such as group outings and community events, to help Mr. Kärkkäinen build relationships and a sense of belonging in the community.
4. **Follow-up visits:** Schedule regular follow-up visits (every 6 weeks) to monitor Mr. Kärkkäinen's progress, provide ongoing support, and address any emerging concerns.

**Next Steps:**
I will submit this report to our supervisor for review and approval. A follow-up visit is scheduled for 15.09.2025 to assess the effectiveness of the recommended actions and make any necessary adjustments to Mr. Kärkkäinen's support plan.
