Social Services Visit Report

Date: 25 August 2024
Location: Kauniainen, Finland
Visit Type: At-risk youth intervention visit
Case Severity: Moderate

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to assess the well-being and safety of a cohabiting couple with mental health challenges in their home in Kauniainen. The visit aimed to identify potential risks and provide support to ensure the stability and security of both individuals.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival, I observed that the couple, Mr. Antti Kauriala (born 1992) and Ms. Leena Kauriala (born 1990), were present in the living room. They appeared anxious and agitated, with visible signs of stress. The atmosphere was tense, and they seemed hesitant to engage in conversation.

During our discussion, it became clear that both individuals have been experiencing symptoms of depression and anxiety for several months. They reported feeling overwhelmed by their daily responsibilities and struggling to cope with the demands of modern life. The couple's mental health challenges were exacerbated by a recent financial setback, which has led to feelings of insecurity and uncertainty.

The living conditions in the apartment were satisfactory, but there were signs of disorganization and clutter. Unopened mail and unpaid bills accumulated on the kitchen counter, indicating potential neglect. The couple's emotional state was fragile, and they appeared to be struggling with communication and conflict resolution skills.

Assessment:
Based on our conversation and observations, it is clear that this couple requires support to address their mental health challenges and improve their overall well-being. The moderate case severity suggests that while there are concerns, the situation is not critical at present. However, if left unaddressed, these issues could escalate, posing risks to both individuals.

The family dynamics were complex, with a history of conflict and emotional distress. Both partners seemed to be struggling with feelings of isolation and disconnection from their community. The couple's reliance on social media as a coping mechanism was evident, but it also raised concerns about potential addiction and decreased face-to-face interaction.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Referral to local mental health services: I recommended that the couple seek professional help from Kauniainen's public mental health clinic. A referral will be made to ensure they receive necessary support and guidance.
2. Financial assistance: The couple is eligible for financial assistance through the Finnish social security system. I will facilitate the application process to alleviate some of their financial burdens.
3. Support groups: I suggested that the couple join a local support group for individuals with mental health challenges. This will provide them with a safe space to share experiences, receive emotional support, and develop coping strategies.
4. Home safety assessment: A home safety assessment will be conducted to identify potential hazards and provide recommendations for improving the living environment.

Timeline:

* Follow-up visit: 15 September 2024
* Referral to mental health services: Completed within the next two weeks
* Financial assistance application: Processed and approved within four weeks

Conclusion:
This visit highlighted the need for targeted support to address the mental health challenges of Mr. Antti Kauriala and Ms. Leena Kauriala. By providing referrals, financial assistance, and connecting them with support groups, we can help this couple stabilize their lives and improve their overall well-being.
