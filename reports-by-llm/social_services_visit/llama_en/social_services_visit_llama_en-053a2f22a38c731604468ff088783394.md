Social Services Visit Report

Date: 18 December 2024
Location: Multia, Finland
Visit Type: Follow-up on school truancy report

Summary of Visit Purpose:
This visit was conducted to follow up on the school truancy report submitted by the Social Services department regarding [Client Name], a youth who is aging out of the foster system. The purpose of this visit was to assess the client's current situation, living conditions, and well-being, as well as provide support and guidance to ensure their successful transition into independent living.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival at the address provided (Kirkonkyl√§nkatu 12, 45600 Multia), I met with [Client Name], who appeared to be in a calm and cooperative state. The client reported that they have been attending school sporadically due to difficulties with motivation and focus. They expressed frustration with their current living situation, stating that it is not conducive to their academic success.

During the visit, I observed that the living space was modest but clean, with basic furnishings and appliances. However, there were signs of disorganization, including cluttered bookshelves and a messy kitchen area. The client's emotional state appeared stable, although they did exhibit some anxiety when discussing their school attendance.

Notable Concerns:
While the client's situation is not considered high-risk at this time, I noted that they are struggling with motivation and focus, which could impact their academic success and future prospects. Additionally, the client's living situation appears to be a contributing factor to these difficulties.

Assessment:
Given the low severity of this case, it is essential to provide ongoing support and guidance to ensure [Client Name]'s successful transition into independent living. The client's motivation and focus can be improved with targeted interventions, such as academic counseling and life skills training. Additionally, exploring options for temporary housing or relocation may help alleviate some of the stressors contributing to their truancy.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Schedule a follow-up visit in six weeks to assess [Client Name]'s progress and provide ongoing support.
2. Refer [Client Name] to a local academic counselor for individualized guidance and support.
3. Explore options for temporary housing or relocation, if necessary, to alleviate stressors contributing to truancy.
4. Provide [Client Name] with information about local resources and services available to support their transition into independent living.
