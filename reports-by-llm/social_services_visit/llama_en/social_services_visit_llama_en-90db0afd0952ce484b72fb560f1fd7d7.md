Social Services Visit Report

Date: 16 July 2025
Location: Lohja, Finland
Visit Type: Parenting Education Follow-up

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct a follow-up assessment on the parenting education program for [Client Name], a non-custodial relative caring for their child in Lohja. The visit aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the support provided and identify any areas requiring further intervention.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival, I met with [Client Name] at their residence located at Kauppakatu 12, 07100 Lohja. The living conditions were satisfactory, with a clean and organized home environment. However, there were signs of clutter in the child's play area, indicating potential for improved organization.

During our conversation, [Client Name] expressed concerns about managing the child's behavior and providing adequate supervision. They reported feeling overwhelmed and struggling to balance work and childcare responsibilities. The child, aged 6, was present during the visit and appeared happy and well-adjusted, but did exhibit some signs of anxiety when discussing their father's absence.

Assessment:
The situation appears moderate in terms of risk, with [Client Name] facing challenges in managing the child's behavior and providing consistent care. However, the overall living conditions and the child's emotional state suggest that support is still necessary to ensure the child's well-being.

Notable concerns include:

* Limited access to childcare services during the day
* Insufficient resources for managing the child's behavior
* Potential impact of [Client Name]'s work schedule on the child's routine

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
Based on this assessment, I recommend that [Client Name] continue attending parenting education sessions to develop strategies for managing the child's behavior and improving their overall well-being. Additionally, I suggest exploring local childcare options to provide more structured support during the day.

To ensure continued progress, I propose a follow-up visit in 6 weeks to assess the effectiveness of the implemented changes and provide further guidance as needed.

Referrals:
I will refer [Client Name] to the Lohja Childcare Services for potential assistance with finding suitable childcare options. Furthermore, I recommend that they contact the Finnish Parenting Education Center to access additional resources and support.

Timeline:

* Follow-up visit: 6 weeks from today's date
* Referral to Lohja Childcare Services: immediate

Case Severity:
Moderate
