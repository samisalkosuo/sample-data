Social Services Visit Report

Date: 26 January 2025
Location: Koski Tl, Finland
Visit Type: Disability Support Assessment

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct a disability support assessment for an adult living with severe mental health conditions in their home. The assessment aimed to evaluate the individual's needs, risks, and family dynamics to determine the most suitable level of support.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival, I met the client, Ms. Aino Virtanen, at her residence in Koski Tl. She appeared disheveled and had difficulty maintaining eye contact. Her living conditions were generally clean, but there were signs of clutter and disorganization in certain areas. The kitchen was in need of cleaning, and there were empty food packets and unwashed dishes scattered about.

Ms. Virtanen reported experiencing anxiety and depression, which had worsened over the past few months. She mentioned feeling isolated and struggling to maintain a daily routine due to her mental health symptoms. I observed that she relied heavily on her phone for entertainment and social interaction, often spending extended periods in front of the screen.

During our conversation, Ms. Virtanen expressed concerns about her ability to manage her finances and perform basic self-care tasks. She reported feeling overwhelmed by household chores and struggling to maintain a clean living environment. Despite these challenges, she demonstrated resilience and a strong desire to regain control over her life.

Assessment:
Based on the assessment, it is clear that Ms. Virtanen requires support to address her mental health needs and improve her overall well-being. The low case severity indicates that while there are concerns, they do not pose an immediate risk to her safety or the safety of others.

The family dynamics were not a significant concern during this visit, as Ms. Virtanen lives alone. However, it is essential to monitor her situation in the future and consider involving family members or friends if necessary.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Referral to local mental health services: I will arrange for Ms. Virtanen to receive counseling sessions and medication management support from a nearby mental health clinic.
2. Home safety assessment: A home safety assessment will be conducted to identify potential hazards and provide recommendations for improving the living environment.
3. Financial assistance: I will explore options for financial assistance, such as government benefits or non-profit organizations, to help Ms. Virtanen manage her expenses.
4. Regular follow-up visits: Scheduled follow-up visits will be arranged every 6 weeks to monitor Ms. Virtanen's progress and adjust support services as needed.

Timeline:

* Within the next 2 weeks: Arrange for mental health services referral and home safety assessment
* Within the next 4 weeks: Conduct financial assistance exploration and schedule regular follow-up visits
