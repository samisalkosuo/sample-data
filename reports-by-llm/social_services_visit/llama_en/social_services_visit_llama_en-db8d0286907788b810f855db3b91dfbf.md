Social Services Visit Report

Date: 20 October 2024
Location: Mäntyharju, Finland
Visit Type: Immigration case monitoring visit

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to monitor the well-being and living conditions of an unaccompanied minor residing in temporary housing in Mäntyharju. The visit aimed to assess the situation's severity and provide support where necessary.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival, I met with the minor, identified as Aliya Hassan, who is a 16-year-old refugee from Somalia. She has been living in temporary housing since her arrival in Finland six months ago. During our conversation, Aliya expressed feelings of loneliness and isolation, stating that she misses her family and friends back home.

The living conditions at the temporary housing facility were satisfactory, with clean and well-maintained rooms. However, I observed some signs of stress and anxiety among the other residents, which may be affecting Aliya's mental health. The staff reported that they have been providing Aliya with support and guidance, but she has been resistant to their efforts.

Assessment:
Given the low severity of this case, it appears that Aliya is generally safe and receiving adequate care. However, her emotional state and feelings of isolation warrant further attention and support. It is essential to provide Aliya with opportunities for socialization and connection with peers who share similar experiences.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Referral to a local youth organization: I will refer Aliya to a reputable youth organization in Mäntyharju that provides cultural and recreational activities for young people from diverse backgrounds.
2. Regular check-ins: The temporary housing staff will continue to provide regular check-ins with Aliya, focusing on her emotional well-being and providing support as needed.
3. Follow-up visit within six weeks: A follow-up visit will be scheduled in six weeks to assess Aliya's progress and adjust the support plan accordingly.

Timeline:

* Within two weeks: The youth organization will contact Aliya to introduce themselves and invite her to participate in their activities.
* Six weeks from today: A follow-up visit will be conducted to evaluate Aliya's participation in the program and provide additional support if needed.
