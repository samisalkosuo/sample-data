Social Services Visit Report

Date: 03.04.2025
Location: Virrat, Finland
Visit Type: Social reintegration assessment

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct a social reintegration assessment for the family residing at address 123 Koulukatu, Virrat, Finland. The visit aimed to evaluate the current situation and provide support to ensure a stable environment for the parent with substance use disorder and their children.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival, I met with Mrs. Leena Rissanen, the mother of two children (ages 8 and 10), at her residence in Virrat. The living conditions were generally satisfactory, with clean and well-maintained furniture. However, there were signs of disorganization, such as scattered papers and dirty dishes in the kitchen.

During our conversation, Mrs. Rissanen expressed gratitude for the visit and acknowledged the challenges she has been facing due to her substance use disorder. She reported that she had been attending counseling sessions at a local rehabilitation center and was making progress in her recovery. The children seemed comfortable with their mother's condition and were supportive of her efforts.

Notable concerns included Mrs. Rissanen's occasional absences from home, which she attributed to her treatment schedule. However, I observed that the children often had to care for themselves during these periods, which may lead to feelings of isolation and responsibility.

Assessment:
Based on the visit, it appears that the family is facing challenges related to Mrs. Rissanen's substance use disorder. However, with proper support and resources, they can work towards a more stable environment. The low case severity indicates that the situation is manageable, but ongoing monitoring and intervention are necessary to prevent further escalation.

Family dynamics were observed to be generally positive, with the children showing resilience and adaptability in the face of their mother's condition. However, it is essential to continue supporting Mrs. Rissanen in her recovery and providing guidance on managing stress and responsibilities.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Continue monitoring Mrs. Rissanen's progress in her rehabilitation program.
2. Arrange for regular counseling sessions with the family to address emotional well-being and coping strategies.
3. Provide support for the children, including access to educational resources and activities that promote their socialization and development.
4. Schedule a follow-up visit within six weeks to assess the family's continued progress and adjust recommendations as needed.
