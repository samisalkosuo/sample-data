Social Services Visit Report

Visit Date: 27.03.2025
Location: Nokia, Finland
Visit Type: Juvenile Probation Compliance Visit
Household Composition: Adult living with severe mental health condition
Case Severity: Low

Summary of Visit Purpose:
This visit was conducted to assess the juvenile's compliance with probation conditions and to evaluate the overall well-being of the household. The case severity is low, indicating that the situation does not pose an immediate risk to the juvenile or others.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival, I met with 17-year-old Emma Kauriala at her family's residence in Nokia, Finland. Emma's mother, Ms. Maria Kauriala, was also present during the visit. The living conditions were generally satisfactory, with a focus on maintaining a clean and organized home environment.

Emma reported that she has been attending school regularly and participating in extracurricular activities, including a part-time job at a local caf√©. She expressed her desire to continue pursuing her education and career goals despite facing some challenges related to her mother's mental health condition.

Ms. Kauriala's severe mental health condition was evident during the visit. She exhibited symptoms of anxiety and depression, which have been ongoing for several years. Emma reported that she has been taking care of her mother's daily needs, including medication management and accompanying her to medical appointments.

Notable concerns included Ms. Kauriala's increasing reliance on social media as a coping mechanism, which may exacerbate her mental health symptoms. Additionally, Emma expressed feelings of frustration and isolation due to the demands of caring for her mother.

Assessment:
The overall assessment suggests that the household is stable, with Emma taking an active role in supporting her mother's well-being. However, the ongoing impact of Ms. Kauriala's mental health condition on the family dynamics cannot be ignored. The risk of escalation or worsening symptoms exists if support services are not accessed and utilized effectively.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Referral to local mental health services: I will refer Emma and her mother to a specialized mental health service in Nokia, Finland, to address Ms. Kauriala's ongoing condition.
2. Support for Emma's education and career goals: The social services department will provide guidance and resources to help Emma pursue her educational and career aspirations.
3. Regular check-ins with the family: I will schedule regular follow-up visits to monitor the household's progress, provide support, and address any emerging concerns.
4. Family therapy sessions: It is recommended that the family participate in family therapy sessions to improve communication, coping mechanisms, and overall well-being.

Timeline for Further Visits:

* Next visit: 10.04.2025
* Follow-up visits: Every 6 weeks until the case is closed
