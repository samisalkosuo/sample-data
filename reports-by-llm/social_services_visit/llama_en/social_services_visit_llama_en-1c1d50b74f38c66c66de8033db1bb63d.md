Social Services Visit Report

Date: 09.03.2025
Location: Hattula, Finland
Visit Type: Post-abuse recovery support visit
Household Composition: Young adult living alone
Case Severity: Moderate

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to provide post-abuse recovery support to a young adult who has experienced domestic violence. The visit aimed to assess the individual's well-being, living conditions, and safety, as well as identify potential risks and areas for improvement.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival at the address, 12300 Hattula, Finland (Kirkonkylänkatu 10), I was greeted by the young adult, Ms. Aino Virtanen. She appeared nervous but cooperative during our conversation. The living room and kitchen were tidy, with minimal personal belongings visible. However, the overall atmosphere felt somewhat sterile, suggesting a possible lack of emotional connection or attachment to the space.

Ms. Virtanen reported feeling anxious and isolated since the incident, often spending long hours indoors due to fear of leaving her home alone. She mentioned having difficulty sleeping and experiencing flashbacks related to the abuse. Her emotional state was evident in her hesitant tone and occasional tears during our conversation.

Notable concerns included Ms. Virtanen's limited access to social support networks, as she had recently moved away from family and friends due to the abuse. Additionally, I observed a lack of self-care practices, such as exercise or hobbies, which could exacerbate her emotional distress.

Assessment:
Given the moderate case severity, it is clear that Ms. Virtanen requires ongoing support to address her physical and emotional well-being. The assessment suggests that she may benefit from connecting with local support groups for survivors of domestic violence, as well as accessing counseling services to process her trauma.

Risks identified during this visit include:

* Isolation and social disconnection
* Limited access to resources and support networks
* Potential exacerbation of mental health symptoms due to lack of self-care

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
Based on the assessment, I recommend the following next steps:

1. Referral to local domestic violence support groups, such as the Hattula Women's Shelter (Hattulan Naisten Säätiö), for ongoing emotional support and connection.
2. Arrangement of counseling sessions with a licensed therapist specializing in trauma-informed care to address Ms. Virtanen's emotional distress.
3. Assistance in connecting Ms. Virtanen with local community resources, such as exercise classes or hobby groups, to promote self-care and social integration.

Timeline for further visits:

* Follow-up visit: 06.04.2025
* Re-evaluation of case severity and progress: 03.05.2025

This report concludes the initial post-abuse recovery support visit. Further updates will be provided during scheduled follow-up visits to monitor Ms. Virtanen's progress and adjust recommendations as necessary.
