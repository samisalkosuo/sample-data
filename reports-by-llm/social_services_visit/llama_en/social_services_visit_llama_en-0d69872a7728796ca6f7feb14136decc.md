Social Services Visit Report

Date: 25.03.2025
Location: Simo, Finland
Visit Type: Substance Abuse Support Visit

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to assess the situation of Mr. Antti Kärkkäinen, a 45-year-old individual living in Simo, Finland, who is struggling with severe mental health conditions and substance abuse issues. The visit aimed to evaluate the current state of his well-being, interactions with family members, and living conditions.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival at Mr. Kärkkäinen's residence, I observed a cluttered and disorganized living space, indicating potential difficulties in maintaining daily routines. The individual appeared lethargic and withdrawn, displaying limited eye contact during our conversation. He reported using various substances to manage his mental health symptoms, including prescription medications and illicit substances.

During the interview, Mr. Kärkkäinen expressed feelings of isolation and hopelessness, citing difficulties in maintaining relationships with family members due to his substance abuse issues. His wife, Mrs. Maria Kärkkäinen, was present during the visit and reported concerns about her husband's increasing dependence on substances and erratic behavior.

Assessment:
The assessment revealed a high level of risk for Mr. Kärkkäinen, primarily due to his severe mental health conditions and substance abuse issues. The individual's living situation is compromised by his inability to maintain a clean and organized environment, which may exacerbate his mental health symptoms. The family dynamics are strained, with Mrs. Kärkkäinen expressing feelings of frustration and helplessness in addressing her husband's behavior.

Case Severity:
The case severity is high due to the presence of severe mental health conditions, substance abuse issues, and compromised living conditions. Immediate support and intervention are necessary to prevent further deterioration of Mr. Kärkkäinen's well-being.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Referral to local mental health services: I recommended that Mr. Kärkkäinen be referred to the Simo Health Center for evaluation and treatment of his mental health conditions.
2. Substance abuse counseling: It is essential to provide Mr. Kärkkäinen with substance abuse counseling to address his dependence on illicit substances and prescription medications.
3. Family support services: I suggested that family support services, such as counseling and education, be provided to Mrs. Kärkkäinen to help her cope with the challenges of caring for a loved one with severe mental health conditions and substance abuse issues.
4. Home safety assessment: A home safety assessment will be conducted to identify potential hazards in the residence and provide recommendations for modifications to ensure a safe living environment.

Timeline:
The next follow-up visit is scheduled for 15.04.2025, at which time I will assess Mr. Kärkkäinen's progress and adjust the recommended actions as necessary.
