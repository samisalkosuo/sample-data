Social Services Visit Report

Date: 27 November 2024
Location: Ylivieska, Finland
Visit Type: Domestic Violence Risk Assessment

Summary of Visit Purpose:
This visit was conducted to assess the risk of domestic violence in the household of Ms. Aino Lehtonen (case number: LV-001234) residing at address 123 Kauppakatu, 69200 Ylivieska, Finland. The visit was triggered by a referral from the local healthcare center, which had received reports of increased conflict and tension within the family.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, I observed that Ms. Lehtonen appeared anxious and on edge, while her partner, Mr. Juhani Laaksonen, seemed dismissive and uncooperative. The children (ages 8, 10, and 12) were present but appeared subdued and reluctant to engage in conversation. The living conditions were modest, with some signs of disorganization and clutter.

During the interview, Ms. Lehtonen reported frequent verbal altercations between herself and Mr. Laaksonen, which had escalated into physical confrontations on several occasions. She also mentioned that she felt isolated and trapped within the household, with limited access to external resources or support. Mr. Laaksonen denied any wrongdoing, stating that Ms. Lehtonen was overreacting and being too sensitive.

Assessment:
The assessment indicates a high risk of domestic violence in this household. The frequency and intensity of conflicts, combined with Ms. Lehtonen's reported feelings of isolation and vulnerability, suggest a pattern of abusive behavior. The children's reluctance to engage in conversation and their apparent distress also raise concerns about the impact of domestic violence on family dynamics.

Case Severity:
Given the urgent nature of this situation, I have classified the case as high-risk. Immediate action is required to ensure the safety and well-being of Ms. Lehtonen and her children.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Emergency Shelter Placement: Arrange for immediate placement in a safe shelter facility to protect Ms. Lehtonen and her children from further harm.
2. Police Involvement: Notify local law enforcement and request their assistance in investigating the allegations of domestic violence.
3. Counseling Services: Referral to counseling services for Ms. Lehtonen and her children to address emotional trauma and develop coping strategies.
4. Financial Assistance: Provide temporary financial assistance to support Ms. Lehtonen's basic needs, including food, clothing, and housing costs.
5. Follow-up Visits: Schedule regular follow-up visits to monitor the situation and provide ongoing support.

Timeline for Further Visits:
- 2 weeks from today: Follow-up visit to assess the household's safety and well-being
- 4 weeks from today: Re-evaluate the case and adjust recommendations as necessary
