Social Services Visit Report

Visit Date: 14.03.2025
Location: Tohmajärvi, Finland
Visit Type: Refugee Integration Support Visit
Household Composition: Young Adult Living Alone
Case Severity: Low

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to assess the well-being and integration progress of a young adult refugee living alone in Tohmajärvi. The visit aimed to evaluate the individual's access to essential services, social connections, and overall quality of life.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival, the young adult, Mr. Ali Hassan, greeted me warmly and invited me into his apartment. He reported feeling relatively settled in Finland, having arrived six months prior. Mr. Hassan expressed gratitude for the refugee integration support provided by our agency, citing assistance with language classes and job placement.

During the visit, I observed a tidy and well-maintained living space, indicating a sense of stability. However, I noted that Mr. Hassan's phone and computer were outdated, which might hinder his access to digital resources and online services. He mentioned struggling to find employment due to limited Finnish language skills, but was optimistic about improving his situation.

Mr. Hassan reported feeling lonely at times, but had recently joined a local sports club to meet new people. He seemed enthusiastic about exploring Tohmajärvi's cultural scene and learning more about Finnish customs.

Assessment:
Based on the visit, it appears that Mr. Hassan is adapting well to life in Finland, with some challenges related to language barriers and employment. The low case severity indicates a relatively stable situation, but ongoing support is necessary to ensure his continued integration and well-being.

Notable concerns include:

* Limited access to digital resources due to outdated technology
* Ongoing struggles with Finnish language skills, potentially impacting employment prospects

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Arrange for an upgrade of Mr. Hassan's phone and computer to improve his access to online services.
2. Schedule additional language classes to enhance his Finnish language proficiency.
3. Explore job placement opportunities tailored to Mr. Hassan's skills and interests.
4. Continue to monitor Mr. Hassan's social connections and encourage him to maintain relationships with local community groups.

Timeline for Follow-up Visits:
* Next visit: 30.04.2025, to review progress on the recommended actions
* Ongoing support: Regular phone calls and check-ins to ensure Mr. Hassan's continued integration and well-being
