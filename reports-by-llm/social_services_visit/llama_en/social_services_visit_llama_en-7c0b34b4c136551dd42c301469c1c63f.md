Social Services Visit Report

Date: 07.12.2024
Location: Masku, Finland
Visit Type: Follow-up on school truancy report

Summary of Visit Purpose:
This visit was conducted to follow up on a recent school truancy report for the Kauranen family, who are immigrants from Somalia and have recently relocated to Masku, Finland. The purpose of this visit is to assess their living situation, interactions with local services, and overall well-being in light of the reported truancy.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival at the Kauranen residence, I was greeted by Mr. and Mrs. Kauranen, who appeared anxious but cooperative during the interview. The family consists of four members: two adults (Mr. and Mrs. Kauranen) and two children (ages 10 and 12). The living conditions were satisfactory, with a clean and well-maintained home. However, I noted that the family was struggling to adjust to their new environment, citing difficulties in finding employment and navigating local services.

During our conversation, it became clear that the truancy report was not solely due to lack of motivation or interest but rather a result of the children's struggles to cope with their new school environment. The parents expressed concerns about their children's social integration and fear of being ostracized by their peers. I observed that the family was actively seeking support from local community organizations, including a Finnish language course and cultural events.

Assessment:
Given the low severity of this case, it appears that the Kauranen family is proactively seeking support to address their challenges. The family's living conditions are satisfactory, and they have demonstrated a willingness to engage with local services. However, ongoing support and monitoring will be necessary to ensure their continued progress.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Schedule regular check-ins (every 6 weeks) to monitor the family's progress and provide ongoing support.
2. Refer the Kauranen children to a school counselor for individualized support to address their social integration challenges.
3. Provide the family with information about local employment services and job training programs to help them find stable employment.
4. Arrange for a home visit in 3 months to assess the family's continued progress and adjust recommendations as needed.

Timeline:
- Next follow-up visit: 02.03.2025 (every 6 weeks)
- Home visit: 06.03.2025
