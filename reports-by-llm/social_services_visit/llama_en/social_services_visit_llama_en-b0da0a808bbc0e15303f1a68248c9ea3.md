Social Services Visit Report

Visit Date: 21.03.2025
Location: Alajärvi, Finland
Visit Type: Safety Plan Monitoring Visit
Case Severity: Low

Summary of Visit Purpose:
This visit was conducted to monitor the safety plan in place for the household consisting of two adult siblings residing at the address provided. The purpose of this visit is to assess the effectiveness of the safety plan and ensure that the household's needs are being met.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival, I observed that the household was tidy and well-maintained. The siblings, Aki and Lina, were both present during my visit and appeared to be in a stable emotional state. They reported having a good understanding of their safety plan and were able to provide examples of how they had implemented its strategies.

During our conversation, I noted that the siblings have been experiencing some stress related to financial difficulties, but they were able to discuss ways in which they are managing these challenges together. Aki mentioned that he has been taking on more responsibilities with household chores and Lina has been helping him with meal planning. This cooperation was seen as a positive aspect of their relationship.

However, I did observe some minor concerns related to the siblings' living situation. The kitchen area was found to be in need of cleaning, and there were some signs of clutter in the living room. Aki mentioned that they have been struggling to find time for cleaning due to work commitments.

Assessment:
Based on my observations during this visit, I assess that the household's safety plan is effective in addressing their immediate needs. The siblings' cooperation and ability to manage stress together are positive indicators of their well-being. However, there are some minor concerns related to living conditions that require attention.

Given the low severity of this case, it is recommended that the siblings continue to work on maintaining a clean and organized living space. I also suggest that they consider seeking additional support for managing financial difficulties, such as budgeting workshops or counseling services.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

* Schedule a follow-up visit in six months to assess the effectiveness of the safety plan and address any new concerns.
* Refer Aki and Lina to local resources for budgeting and financial management, such as the Alajärvi City Council's financial assistance program.
* Encourage the siblings to maintain open communication with each other and seek support from trusted friends or family members if needed.
