Social Services Visit Report

Visit Date: 21.03.2025
Location: Jämijärvi, Finland
Visit Type: Disability support assessment

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct a disability support assessment for the family residing at address 123 Kyläntie, Jämijärvi, in light of their history of chronic domestic violence. The assessment aimed to evaluate the current situation, risks, and family dynamics to determine the level of support required.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, I observed a moderate level of tension within the household, with the parents (Mr. and Mrs. Kauriala) exhibiting signs of stress and anxiety. The children (Aki, 12, and Lotta, 9) appeared to be on edge, with Aki displaying increased agitation during our conversation. The living conditions were satisfactory, with adequate space for all family members. However, the presence of unopened letters and unmarked packages in the mailbox suggested potential ongoing issues.

During the assessment, I noted that Mr. Kauriala seemed hesitant to discuss his wife's behavior, citing "personal reasons" for not wanting to elaborate. Mrs. Kauriala appeared defensive when questioned about her actions, stating she was "just trying to provide for our family." The children displayed varying levels of emotional regulation, with Aki becoming increasingly agitated during the conversation.

Assessment:
Given the history of chronic domestic violence and current tensions within the household, I assessed this situation as moderate in severity. While the living conditions are satisfactory, the ongoing presence of unmarked packages and letters suggests potential ongoing issues that require attention. The family's dynamics appear strained, with Mr. Kauriala and Mrs. Kauriala displaying a lack of open communication.

Notable concerns include:

* Aki's increased agitation during our conversation may indicate underlying emotional distress or trauma.
* Mrs. Kauriala's behavior suggests potential ongoing abuse or neglect.
* The family's reluctance to discuss their situation in detail raises concerns about the level of support required.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
Based on this assessment, I recommend:

1. Referral to local domestic violence support services for counseling and guidance.
2. Collaboration with the Finnish Social Security Institution (Kela) to explore potential financial assistance for the family.
3. Regular follow-up visits every 6 weeks to monitor the situation and provide ongoing support.

Timeline for Further Visits:
The next scheduled visit will be on 11.04.2025, at which time I will assess the family's progress and adjust recommendations as necessary.
