**Social Services Visit Report**

**Visit Date:** 18 May 2025
**Location:** Kristiinankaupunki, Finland
**Visit Type:** Child Visitation Supervision Report

**Summary of Visit Purpose:**
This visit was conducted as part of an urgent child visitation supervision report to assess the well-being and safety of the elderly couple residing at their independent living unit in Kristiinankaupunki. The primary concern was to evaluate the potential risks associated with the couple's ability to provide adequate care for their grandchildren, who are currently being cared for by a family member.

**Observations During the Visit:**
Upon arrival, I observed that the elderly couple, Mr. and Mrs. Taavitsainen, were both in good physical health and appeared to be well-cared for. The living unit was clean and tidy, with no signs of neglect or abuse. However, during our conversation, it became apparent that the couple's ability to provide emotional support and guidance to their grandchildren was limited due to their advanced age and declining cognitive abilities.

The couple reported that they were struggling to cope with the responsibilities of caring for their grandchildren, who are currently living with a family member in another part of Finland. They expressed concerns about their own mortality and the potential impact on their grandchildren's well-being if they were no longer able to provide care.

**Assessment:**
Based on my observations and assessment, I conclude that the couple is facing significant challenges in providing adequate care for their grandchildren due to their advanced age and declining cognitive abilities. The couple's emotional state is also a concern, as they appear to be struggling with feelings of guilt and anxiety related to their inability to provide care.

The potential risks associated with this situation include the possibility of neglect or abuse of the grandchildren if the family member caring for them is unable to provide adequate support. Therefore, it is essential that we explore alternative care arrangements for the grandchildren as soon as possible.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up:**
In light of the urgent nature of this case, I recommend that the following actions be taken:

1. Immediate referral to a social worker specializing in geriatric care to assess the couple's needs and develop a plan for providing additional support.
2. Exploration of alternative care arrangements for the grandchildren, including potential placement with a foster family or respite care services.
3. Regular follow-up visits to monitor the couple's well-being and provide ongoing support.

I propose that our agency work closely with the Finnish Social Security Institution (Kela) to access resources and services that can support the elderly couple and their grandchildren.

**Timeline for Further Visits:**
Based on my assessment, I recommend that we schedule regular follow-up visits every 6-8 weeks to monitor the situation and provide ongoing support to the couple and their grandchildren.
