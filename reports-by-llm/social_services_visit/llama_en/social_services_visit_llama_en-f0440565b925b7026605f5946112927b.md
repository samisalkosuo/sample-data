Location: Multia, Finland
Visit Type: Parental Capacity Evaluation

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct a parental capacity evaluation for the young couple, Antti and Leena Rissanen, expecting their first child. The visit aimed to assess the couple's ability to provide a safe and nurturing environment for their future child.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival at the Rissanen residence, located at Kauppakatu 12, Multia, Finland, I observed a clean and well-maintained living space. Antti and Leena were welcoming and cooperative during the visit, providing information about their lifestyle, work schedules, and plans for childcare.

During our conversation, it became clear that both partners are committed to co-parenting and sharing responsibilities. They demonstrated a good understanding of each other's strengths and weaknesses, which bodes well for their future partnership. However, there were moments where they appeared slightly overwhelmed by the prospect of caring for a new child, particularly Antti.

Leena expressed concerns about balancing work and family life, while Antti mentioned the need to establish a routine for childcare. These discussions highlighted the couple's awareness of potential challenges but also their willingness to learn and adapt together.

Assessment:
Based on the observations during the visit, I assess the situation as low-risk. The Rissanens appear capable of providing a stable and loving environment for their child. Their communication, cooperation, and commitment to co-parenting are positive indicators of their ability to navigate the challenges of parenthood.

However, it is essential to acknowledge that this evaluation is not exhaustive, and further monitoring may be necessary to ensure the couple's capacity to care for their child effectively. I recommend regular check-ins with the couple to provide support and address any emerging concerns.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Schedule a follow-up visit in 6 months to assess the Rissanens' progress in establishing a childcare routine and addressing any challenges they may face.
2. Provide the couple with information on local parenting resources, including parenting classes and support groups, to help them prepare for parenthood.
3. Offer referrals to relevant services, such as counseling or financial assistance programs, if needed.

Timeline:

* Follow-up visit: 06.07.2026
* Next review: 12.07.2027
