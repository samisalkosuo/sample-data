Social Services Visit Report

Date: 07.08.2024
Location: Laihia, Finland
Visit Type: Post-hospital discharge visit

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to assess the well-being of the family following the parent's recent hospitalization for substance use disorder. The post-hospital discharge visit aimed to evaluate the living conditions, interactions within the household, and provide support to ensure a safe environment for the children.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival at the address, 12300 Laihia, Finland (Korsholminkatu 12), I observed that the parent, Mr. Antti Kukkala, was present but appeared disheveled and lethargic. The two children, aged 8 and 10, were seen playing in the living room while their mother was sitting on the couch, staring blankly at the TV. The atmosphere felt tense, with an air of uncertainty.

During our conversation, Mr. Kukkala expressed difficulty in managing his substance use disorder, citing feelings of isolation and lack of support from family members. He acknowledged that his children were aware of his struggles but seemed uncertain about how to address it. The mother appeared overwhelmed, struggling to balance her own emotional state with the demands of caring for her children.

Assessment:
The situation appears high-risk due to Mr. Kukkala's substance use disorder and its impact on the family dynamics. The parent's lack of support system and apparent inability to manage his condition pose a significant threat to the well-being of his children. The mother's emotional state is also concerning, as she seems to be shouldering an excessive burden.

The household environment appears disorganized, with cluttered living spaces and unhygienic conditions. This may exacerbate Mr. Kukkala's substance use disorder and further compromise the family's overall well-being.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Referral to local support services: I will arrange for a meeting between Mr. Kukkala, his children, and a social worker specializing in addiction treatment. This will provide an opportunity for the family to discuss their needs and develop a plan for addressing Mr. Kukkala's substance use disorder.
2. Home safety assessment: A home safety assessment will be conducted to identify potential hazards and provide recommendations for improving the living environment.
3. Parenting support: The mother will benefit from parenting classes or counseling to help her cope with the emotional demands of caring for her children while managing Mr. Kukkala's substance use disorder.
4. Follow-up visits: Regular follow-up visits will be scheduled to monitor the family's progress, provide ongoing support, and adjust recommendations as needed.

Timeline:

* Referral to addiction treatment services: 21.08.2024
