Social Services Visit Report

Visit Date: 12.04.2025
Location: Siuntio, Finland
Visit Type: Household Financial Hardship Review

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct a review of the household's financial situation in light of the critical case severity. The unaccompanied minor residing in temporary housing required immediate attention due to their precarious living circumstances.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival, I met with the minor, Juhani Laaksonen (age 16), who appeared anxious and withdrawn. He shared that he had been struggling to cope with his current situation, feeling isolated and uncertain about his future. The temporary housing facility provided by the local authorities was deemed insufficient, as it lacked basic amenities such as a stable internet connection and access to educational resources.

During my conversation with Juhani, I observed signs of emotional distress, including frequent sighing and avoiding eye contact. His living conditions were also noted to be substandard, with limited space for personal belongings and inadequate lighting in the shared rooms.

The minor's caregiver, Ms. Maria Rodriguez (age 35), was present during our conversation. She expressed concern about Juhani's well-being but seemed overwhelmed by her own financial struggles. The household's income was insufficient to cover basic expenses, let alone provide any form of support or stability for Juhani.

Assessment:
The situation is critical due to the minor's vulnerability and lack of access to essential resources. The temporary housing facility's limitations have exacerbated Juhani's emotional distress, while Ms. Rodriguez's financial struggles have created a sense of uncertainty and insecurity within the household.

Family dynamics appear strained, with both parties struggling to cope with their individual circumstances. The absence of a stable support network and limited access to social services have contributed to this situation.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Immediate Referral: Juhani will be referred to the Siuntio Youth Center for additional support and guidance.
2. Financial Assistance: Ms. Rodriguez will be connected with local financial assistance programs to help alleviate her financial burdens.
3. Housing Support: The temporary housing facility will be reassessed, and alternative options explored to provide a more stable living environment for Juhani.
4. Regular Follow-up Visits: Scheduled visits will be conducted every two weeks to monitor the household's progress and provide ongoing support.

Timeline:

* Next visit: 24.04.2025
* Follow-up with Siuntio Youth Center: 26.04.2025
