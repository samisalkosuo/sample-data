Social Services Visit Report

Date: 22 August 2024

Location: Nurmijärvi, Finland

Visit Type: Post-abuse recovery support visit

Case Information:
Client Name: Leena Kukkia
Address: Koulunkatu 12, 42420 Nurmijärvi, Finland
Household Composition: Transitional housing residents post-rehabilitation (Leena and two children)

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to assess the well-being and safety of Leena and her children in their transitional housing setting. The visit aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the rehabilitation program and identify any potential risks or concerns that may require additional support.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival, I observed a calm and cooperative atmosphere within the household. Leena greeted me warmly and provided an update on the family's daily activities. She reported that the children were doing well in school and enjoying their time in transitional housing. However, she expressed some concerns about the lack of community resources available in Nurmijärvi, which made it challenging for her to access support services.

During our conversation, I noticed that Leena seemed hesitant to discuss her past experiences with abuse. She appeared guarded and reserved, but was willing to share information when prompted. The children, aged 10 and 12, were friendly and open, sharing their thoughts on school and hobbies. However, they also displayed some signs of anxiety and stress, particularly during discussions about their mother's past.

Assessment:
Based on the observations and conversations during the visit, I assessed the situation as moderate in terms of risk. Leena appears to be making progress in her recovery, but still requires support and guidance to address underlying emotional trauma. The children seem resilient and adaptable, but may benefit from additional counseling or therapy to cope with their mother's experiences.

Notable concerns include:

* Limited access to community resources and support services
* Leena's reluctance to discuss her past experiences with abuse
* Children's signs of anxiety and stress related to their mother's history

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Referral to local counseling services for Leena and the children, focusing on trauma-informed care and family therapy.
2. Assistance in accessing community resources, including support groups and online forums, to enhance Leena's social connections and sense of belonging.
3. Regular follow-up visits to monitor progress, provide ongoing support, and address any emerging concerns.

Timeline for Further Visits:

* Next visit: 10 September 2024
* Follow-up visits: every 6 weeks until the end of the rehabilitation program (approximately 12 months)

Conclusion:
This post-abuse recovery support visit provided valuable insights into Leena's situation and identified areas requiring additional support. By providing referrals to counseling services, community resources, and regular follow-up visits, we can help Leena and her children navigate their recovery journey and build a more stable and secure future.
