Social Services Visit Report

Visit Date: 23.03.2025
Location: Ulvila, Finland
Visit Type: Post-abuse recovery support visit

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to assess the well-being of Ms. Maria Lehtonen, an adult living with a severe mental health condition in Ulvila, Finland. The visit aimed to provide post-abuse recovery support and evaluate the current situation to identify potential risks and areas for improvement.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival at the residence, I observed that Ms. Lehtonen was experiencing emotional distress, which had been exacerbated by a recent incident of domestic violence. She reported feeling isolated and unsupported, with limited access to social services and resources. The living conditions were satisfactory, but the home environment felt cluttered and disorganized.

During our conversation, Ms. Lehtonen expressed feelings of shame and guilt regarding the abuse she suffered at the hands of her partner. She also mentioned difficulties in managing her mental health condition due to lack of professional support and medication adherence. Notable concerns included:

* Ms. Lehtonen's partner was absent from the residence during the visit, which raised suspicions about potential ongoing abuse.
* The household lacked basic self-care items, such as toiletries and cleaning supplies, indicating a need for practical support.
* Ms. Lehtonen reported experiencing flashbacks and nightmares related to the abuse, highlighting the urgent need for trauma-informed care.

Assessment:
The assessment revealed a high-risk situation due to Ms. Lehtonen's severe mental health condition, lack of social support, and potential ongoing abuse. The household dynamics were strained, with Ms. Lehtonen feeling isolated and unsupported. The absence of her partner during the visit raised concerns about his involvement in the abuse.

Family Dynamics:
The relationship between Ms. Lehtonen and her partner was marked by control, manipulation, and emotional abuse. Ms. Lehtonen reported feeling trapped in the relationship due to financial dependence and lack of resources. The power imbalance in the household made it challenging for Ms. Lehtonen to assert herself or seek help.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
Based on the assessment, I recommend the following:

* Immediate referral to a local domestic violence shelter and counseling services to provide Ms. Lehtonen with safe space and trauma-informed care.
* Coordination with the Finnish Social Security Institution (Kela) to explore options for financial support and assistance with basic needs.
* Arrangement of regular home visits to monitor living conditions, provide emotional support, and facilitate access to resources.
* Collaboration with local mental health services to develop a comprehensive treatment plan addressing Ms. Lehtonen's severe mental health condition.

Timeline:
The next visit is scheduled for 10.04.2025, during which I will assess the effectiveness of the recommended actions and provide further support as needed.
