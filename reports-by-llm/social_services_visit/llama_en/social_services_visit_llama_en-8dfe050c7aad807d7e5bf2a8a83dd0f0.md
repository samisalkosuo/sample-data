Social Services Visit Report

Date: 13.08.2024
Location: Ii, Finland
Visit Type: At-risk youth intervention visit
Household Composition: Transitional housing residents post-rehabilitation
Case Severity: Low

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to assess the well-being and safety of the transitional housing residents, focusing on the at-risk youth who require ongoing support. The visit aimed to identify any emerging concerns or needs that may impact their rehabilitation progress.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival, I observed a calm and cooperative atmosphere within the residence. The youth, Juhani Laaksonen (age 19), was engaged in a group activity with his peers, demonstrating positive social interactions. However, during individual conversations, Juhani expressed some anxiety about his future plans and concerns regarding his job prospects.

The living conditions were satisfactory, with clean and well-maintained facilities. The youth's personal belongings were organized, indicating a sense of responsibility. Notable concerns included the limited availability of recreational activities and the need for more structured programs to support their rehabilitation.

Assessment:
Given the low case severity, the overall situation appears stable. Juhani's emotional state is manageable, and he demonstrates a willingness to engage with services. However, it is essential to continue monitoring his progress and addressing any emerging concerns promptly.

Family dynamics were not directly observed during this visit, as the youth resides in transitional housing. Nevertheless, it is crucial to maintain open communication with the youth and their support network to ensure a cohesive approach to their rehabilitation.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Schedule regular check-ins with Juhani to monitor his progress and provide ongoing support.
2. Collaborate with local employment services to explore job opportunities and develop skills training programs tailored to his interests.
3. Arrange for recreational activities and social events to enhance the youth's socialization and well-being.
4. Consider referring Juhani to a mentorship program, which could provide guidance and support in his transition to independent living.

Timeline:

* Next visit: 10.09.2024
* Follow-up phone call: 15.08.2024 (to confirm Juhani's availability for the scheduled check-in)
