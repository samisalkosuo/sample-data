Social Services Visit Report

Date: 25 February 2025
Location: Kumlinge, Finland
Visit Type: Mental Health Monitoring Visit

Summary of Visit Purpose:
This visit was conducted to monitor the mental health status of siblings, Anna-Liisa Kivim채ki and Maria Kivim채ki (hereafter referred to as the clients), who are sharing housing in Kumlinge. The purpose of this visit is to assess their well-being, identify any potential risks or concerns, and provide support if needed.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, I observed that Anna-Liisa and Maria were both present at home. They greeted me warmly and provided a brief overview of their daily routines. The living conditions appeared satisfactory, with clean and organized premises. However, there was a noticeable lack of personal space and clutter in the common areas.

During our conversation, it became apparent that the clients have been experiencing some stress related to financial difficulties and work-related pressures. They reported feeling overwhelmed and anxious about their future prospects. Despite this, they expressed appreciation for each other's company and support.

Notable concerns included Maria's struggles with sleep patterns, which she attributed to anxiety, and Anna-Liisa's increasing reliance on social media as a coping mechanism. Both clients acknowledged the importance of seeking professional help but were hesitant due to concerns about stigma and cost.

Assessment:
Given the low severity of this case, it is essential to acknowledge that the clients are managing their mental health relatively well. However, the identified stressors and concerns warrant ongoing support and monitoring. The close relationship between Anna-Liisa and Maria provides a strong foundation for mutual support, but it is crucial to address individual needs and develop coping strategies.

Family dynamics appear stable, with both clients expressing commitment to each other's well-being. However, it is essential to encourage open communication about their mental health and provide resources for seeking professional help when needed.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Referral to local counseling services: I will schedule an appointment for Anna-Liisa and Maria to receive individualized support addressing their specific concerns.
2. Financial assistance: The clients may be eligible for financial assistance programs to alleviate some of the stress related to work-related pressures.
3. Regular follow-ups: To ensure the clients are receiving adequate support, I recommend scheduling bi-monthly visits to monitor their progress and provide ongoing guidance.

Timeline:
- Schedule counseling sessions within the next two weeks
- Follow up with local authorities regarding financial assistance programs (estimated completion date: 15 March 2025)
- Conduct bi-monthly follow-up visits until further notice

Conclusion:
This visit has provided an opportunity to assess the mental health status of Anna-Liisa Kivim채ki and Maria Kivim채ki. While their situation is considered low severity, it is essential to provide ongoing support and monitoring to address identified concerns. By offering counseling services, financial assistance, and regular follow-ups, we can help these clients maintain their well-being and improve their quality of life.
