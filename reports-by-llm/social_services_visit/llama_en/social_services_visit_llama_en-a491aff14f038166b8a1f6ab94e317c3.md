Social Services Visit Report

Date: 17 February 2025
Location: Tammela, Finland
Visit Type: Follow-up on school truancy report

Summary of Visit Purpose:
This visit was conducted to follow up on a recent school truancy report for the family residing at address 123 Koulukatu, Tammela. The purpose of this visit is to assess the situation and provide support to ensure the child's education and well-being.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival, I met with Mr. Antti Lehtonen, the primary caregiver, who reported that his daughter, Aino Lehtonen (age 12), has been experiencing difficulties in school due to bullying and social anxiety. The family has been residing in transitional housing since their rehabilitation program concluded six months ago.

During the visit, I observed a calm and cooperative atmosphere within the household. Mr. Lehtonen reported that he and his wife, Sari Lehtonen (age 45), have been working together to support Aino's education and well-being. However, they expressed concerns about their limited financial resources and lack of access to additional support services.

Notable concerns included:

* Aino's emotional state appeared stable during the visit, but Mr. Lehtonen reported that she has been experiencing increased anxiety and sadness at home.
* The household's living conditions were satisfactory, with basic amenities and a clean environment.
* I observed some signs of stress and fatigue among the family members, particularly Mrs. Lehtonen, who reported feeling overwhelmed by her caregiving responsibilities.

Assessment:
The situation appears to be moderate in terms of severity. While Aino's truancy is a concern, the family's cooperation and efforts to address the issue are commendable. However, the lack of access to additional support services and limited financial resources pose risks to the child's education and well-being.

Family dynamics:

* Mr. Lehtonen reported that he and his wife have been working together as a team to support Aino, but there were moments of tension and disagreement during our conversation.
* Aino appeared hesitant to discuss her feelings and concerns, suggesting that she may be struggling with trust issues or feeling overwhelmed by the situation.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Referral to local educational authorities: I will refer Mr. Lehtonen to the Tammela School District's truancy officer to explore options for additional support services, such as counseling and tutoring.
2. Financial assistance: I will contact the Finnish Social Insurance Institution (Kela) to inquire about potential financial assistance programs that may be available to support the family's living expenses.
3. Follow-up visit: A follow-up visit is scheduled for 31 March 2025 to assess the family's progress in addressing Aino's truancy and provide additional support as needed.

Timeline:

* 17 February 2025: Initial visit
* 31 March 2025: Follow-up visit
* Ongoing: Regular communication with Mr. Lehtonen and the Tammela School District to monitor Aino's progress and adjust recommendations as necessary.
