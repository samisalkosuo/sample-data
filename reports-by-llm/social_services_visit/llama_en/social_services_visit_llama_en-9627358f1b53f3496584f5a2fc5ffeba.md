Social Services Visit Report

Date: 14 August 2024
Location: Halsua, Finland
Visit Type: Refugee Integration Support Visit

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to assess the well-being and integration needs of the Kauranen family, a married couple with four children, who are refugees in Finland. The case severity is critical due to concerns about the family's living conditions, emotional state, and ability to cope with their new environment.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival at the Kauranen residence, located at Kauppatorinkatu 12, Halsua, I was greeted by Mr. and Mrs. Kauranen, who appeared anxious and stressed. The children, aged 8, 10, 12, and 14, seemed withdrawn and hesitant to engage in conversation. The living room was cluttered with belongings, and the kitchen area was in disarray. There were signs of food scarcity, including empty food packets and expired milk.

During our conversation, Mr. Kauranen expressed feelings of isolation and frustration, stating that he struggled to find employment due to his limited language skills. Mrs. Kauranen seemed overwhelmed by the responsibilities of caring for their children alone, as her husband's job prospects were uncertain. The children displayed signs of anxiety and depression, with one child openly expressing suicidal thoughts.

Assessment:
The assessment revealed a critical situation where the family is struggling to cope with their new environment. The lack of employment opportunities for Mr. Kauranen, combined with Mrs. Kauranen's caregiving responsibilities, has led to feelings of isolation and hopelessness. The children's emotional state is concerning, with one child displaying suicidal tendencies.

The living conditions are substandard, with signs of food scarcity and disorganization in the home. This suggests that the family may be struggling financially, which could exacerbate their emotional state.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
Based on this critical assessment, I recommend the following actions:

1. Immediate referral to a local employment agency to assist Mr. Kauranen in finding job opportunities.
2. Connection with a social worker specializing in refugee integration to provide guidance and support for Mrs. Kauranen.
3. Collaboration with a mental health professional to address the children's emotional state, including the child who expressed suicidal thoughts.
4. Assistance with food and household supplies to alleviate some of the family's financial burdens.

Follow-up visits will be scheduled every two weeks to monitor the family's progress and adjust recommendations as necessary.
