Social Services Visit Report

Date: 22.10.2024
Location: Ylitornio, Finland
Visit Type: Safety Plan Monitoring Visit

Summary of Visit Purpose:
This visit was conducted to monitor the safety plan implemented for the young couple, Antti and Aino, expecting their first child in Ylitornio, Finland. The visit aimed to assess the effectiveness of the plan, identify any potential risks or concerns, and provide support to ensure a safe and stable environment for the family.

Observations During the Visit:
During the visit, I observed that Antti and Aino were cooperative and open about their situation. They reported feeling overwhelmed with the upcoming arrival of their child and expressed concerns about managing their finances and household responsibilities. The living conditions at their address, 123 Koulukatu, Ylitornio, appeared to be modest but clean and well-maintained.

Notable concerns included Antti's history of substance abuse, which he acknowledged was a challenge in maintaining sobriety. Aino reported that she had noticed some signs of stress and anxiety in Antti during the past few weeks. The couple expressed a desire for counseling and support to address these issues.

Assessment:
The situation appears to be moderate in terms of case severity. While there are concerns about Antti's substance abuse history, the couple is cooperative and committed to addressing their challenges. However, the upcoming arrival of their child increases the risk of stress and potential exacerbation of existing issues. It is essential to provide ongoing support and monitoring to ensure a safe and stable environment for the family.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
Based on the assessment, I recommend that Antti and Aino continue to attend counseling sessions to address their substance abuse concerns and develop strategies for managing stress and anxiety. I also suggest that they receive guidance on parenting classes and resources for new parents in Ylitornio.

In addition, I will refer them to the local social services department's support group for families with a history of substance abuse. The couple will be scheduled for regular follow-up visits to monitor their progress and provide ongoing support.

Timeline:
- Antti and Aino will attend counseling sessions every two weeks for the next three months.
- They will receive guidance on parenting classes within the next four weeks.
- Regular follow-up visits will be scheduled every six weeks for the next six months.
