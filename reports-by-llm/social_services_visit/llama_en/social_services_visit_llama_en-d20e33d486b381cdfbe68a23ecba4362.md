Social Services Visit Report

Date: 07.11.2024
Location: Polvij채rvi, Finland
Visit Type: Household Financial Hardship Review

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct a review of the household's financial situation in light of the youth's aging out of the foster system. The moderate case severity indicates that while the family is facing challenges, they are not experiencing extreme difficulties.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival at the address, 12300 Polvij채rvi, Finland (Kirkonkyl채nkatu 10), I was greeted by the youth, Juhani Laaksonen, who appeared anxious and uncertain about the visit. The household consists of Juhani, his mother, Marjaana Laaksonen, and father, Pekka Laaksonen. During our conversation, it became clear that the family is struggling to make ends meet due to reduced income from Pekka's job loss.

The living conditions are modest, with a small kitchen and one bedroom. The household has been relying on food banks and government assistance programs to supplement their income. Juhani expressed concerns about his future, feeling uncertain about his ability to support himself financially after leaving the foster system.

Assessment:
Given the moderate case severity, it is essential to acknowledge the family's efforts to cope with financial hardship while also recognizing the need for additional support. The youth's emotional state and uncertainty about his future are significant concerns that require attention from social services.

The household dynamics appear strained, particularly between Juhani and his parents. Marjaana and Pekka seem overwhelmed by their responsibilities, which may be exacerbating the family's financial difficulties. It is crucial to address these dynamics to ensure a stable environment for Juhani as he transitions into adulthood.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Referral to local food bank services: The household will benefit from additional support in accessing food assistance programs.
2. Employment counseling: Pekka will receive guidance on job search strategies and resume development to enhance his employability.
3. Family therapy sessions: Marjaana, Pekka, and Juhani will participate in regular family therapy sessions to address underlying issues and improve communication.
4. Financial planning workshops: The household will attend workshops focused on budgeting, saving, and managing debt to better navigate their financial situation.

Timeline for Follow-up Visits:

* 02.12.2024: Follow-up visit to assess the effectiveness of recommended actions and provide additional support as needed.
* 15.01.2025: Review of Pekka's employment progress and potential adjustments to the support plan.
