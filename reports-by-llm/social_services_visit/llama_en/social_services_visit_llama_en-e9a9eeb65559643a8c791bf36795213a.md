Social Services Visit Report

Date: 09.05.2025
Location: Hankasalmi, Finland
Visit Type: Family Reunification Progress Check

Summary of Visit Purpose:
This visit was conducted to assess the progress of the cohabiting couple's family reunification plan, which is currently classified as moderate in severity. The primary focus of this visit was to evaluate the couple's living conditions, interactions, and overall well-being, with a view to identifying any potential risks or concerns that may impact their ability to achieve stable reunification.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival at the residence located at Koulukatu 12, Hankasalmi, I observed a calm and generally peaceful environment. The couple, Mr. Antti Laaksonen (born 1985) and Ms. Leena Siltanen (born 1988), were present during my visit. They appeared to be managing their mental health challenges with the support of local services, including regular therapy sessions.

During our conversation, I noted that both partners reported feeling supported by each other and expressed a strong desire to continue working towards reunification. However, they also acknowledged some challenges in maintaining open communication and managing stress. The couple's living conditions were found to be satisfactory, with basic needs being met.

Notable concerns raised during the visit included Mr. Laaksonen's struggles with anxiety, which sometimes led to irritability and mood swings. Ms. Siltanen reported feeling overwhelmed by her partner's emotional outbursts, but expressed willingness to continue seeking support together.

Assessment:
Based on my observations and discussions with the couple, I assessed that their situation remains moderate in severity. While they have made progress in managing their mental health challenges, there are still potential risks associated with their relationship dynamics. The couple's ability to maintain open communication and manage stress will be crucial in achieving stable reunification.

Recommendations:
1. Regular therapy sessions: Continue to support the couple through regular therapy sessions to address ongoing mental health concerns.
2. Stress management training: Recommend that both partners participate in stress management training to improve their coping mechanisms.
3. Family counseling: Consider referring the couple for family counseling to enhance communication and conflict resolution skills.

Follow-up:
The next scheduled visit will be on 15.06.2025, six weeks from the date of this report. During this visit, I will assess the couple's progress in addressing the recommended actions and provide further support as needed.
