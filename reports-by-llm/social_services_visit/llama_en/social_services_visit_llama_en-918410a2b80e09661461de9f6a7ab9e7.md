Social Services Visit Report

Visit Date: 02.03.2025
Location: Kankaanpää, Finland
Visit Type: Child visitation supervision report

Summary of Visit Purpose:
This urgent child visitation supervision report was conducted to assess the well-being and safety of the family of five residing in a subsidized apartment in Kankaanpää. The purpose of this visit was to evaluate the current living conditions, interactions among family members, and any potential risks or concerns that may impact the child's emotional and physical development.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival at the residence, I observed a generally chaotic environment with cluttered living areas and disorganized storage spaces. The parents, Juhani and Leena, were present during my visit, but their interactions seemed strained and brief. They reported that they had been experiencing financial difficulties and stress related to their employment situations.

The children, aged 7, 9, 11, and 13, appeared generally healthy and engaged in various activities, including homework and outdoor play. However, I noted that the eldest child displayed signs of anxiety and frustration during our conversation, which may be indicative of unresolved family conflicts or unmet emotional needs.

Notable concerns included the presence of unattended hazardous materials, such as sharp objects and hot surfaces, in the living areas, which posed a risk to the children's safety. Additionally, I observed that the parents seemed overwhelmed with household responsibilities, which may have contributed to their stress levels.

Assessment:
Given the urgency of this situation, my assessment indicates that the family is facing significant challenges related to financial stability, emotional well-being, and household management. The presence of hazardous materials and signs of anxiety among the children suggest a need for immediate attention and support to ensure their safety and development.

The family's dynamics appear strained, with limited opportunities for open communication and conflict resolution. This may be contributing to the stress levels and overall sense of chaos in the home environment. It is essential that the family receives targeted support to address these issues and develop healthier relationships.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
Based on my assessment, I recommend the following:

1. Immediate referral to local social services for financial assistance and counseling to address the parents' employment situations.
2. Coordination with the Finnish Social Security Institution (Kela) to explore options for additional support, such as childcare subsidies or home care services.
3. Scheduling a follow-up visit within two weeks to assess the family's progress and provide ongoing support.
4. Collaboration with local schools to monitor the children's academic performance and emotional well-being.

Timeline:

* Within 48 hours: Follow up with Juhani and Leena to discuss referral options and provide information on available resources.
* Two weeks from today: Schedule a follow-up visit to assess the family's progress and adjust recommendations as needed.
