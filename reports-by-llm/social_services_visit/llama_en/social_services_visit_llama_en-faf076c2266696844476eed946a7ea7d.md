Social Services Visit Report

Date: 28 September 2024
Location: Eura, Finland
Visit Type: Domestic Relocation Follow-up
Case Severity: Moderate

Summary of Visit Purpose:
This visit was conducted to follow up on the recent domestic relocation of the family, which has been affected by recent custody changes. The primary purpose of this visit is to assess the well-being and adjustment of the family members, particularly the children, in their new living arrangements.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival at the residence, I was greeted by Mrs. Lehtinen (mother) and Mr. Kauriala (father). They appeared anxious and stressed, with visible signs of fatigue. The children, aged 8 and 10, seemed hesitant to engage in conversation, displaying some emotional distress.

The living conditions were satisfactory, with adequate space for the family members. However, there were signs of disorganization and clutter, which may be contributing to the stress levels. The kitchen was in need of cleaning, and the bathroom required attention.

During our conversation, it became apparent that both parents were struggling to adjust to their new roles and responsibilities. They expressed concerns about the children's adjustment to the relocation and the impact on their relationships with each other. Mrs. Lehtinen reported feeling overwhelmed by the demands of single parenthood, while Mr. Kauriala struggled with feelings of inadequacy.

Assessment:
The family is facing moderate challenges in adjusting to their new living arrangements. The recent custody changes have caused significant emotional distress for all family members, particularly the children. The parents' stress levels are high, and their ability to provide a stable and nurturing environment is compromised.

Notable concerns include:

* The children's emotional well-being: They appear to be struggling with anxiety and uncertainty about their new living arrangements.
* Parental stress levels: Both parents are experiencing significant stress, which may impact their ability to care for the children effectively.
* Living conditions: The disorganization and clutter in the residence may contribute to the family's overall stress levels.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Referral to counseling services: I recommend that the family receive individual and joint counseling sessions to address their emotional distress and improve communication.
2. Home maintenance support: The Social Services department will provide assistance with home maintenance tasks, including cleaning and organization, to alleviate some of the stress associated with these responsibilities.
3. Parenting classes: A parenting class is recommended to help both parents develop effective strategies for managing their roles and responsibilities in a blended family setting.
4. Follow-up visits: Regular follow-up visits will be scheduled to monitor the family's progress and provide ongoing support.

Timeline:

* Next follow-up visit: 12 weeks from today
* Counseling sessions: To be arranged within the next 6 weeks
* Home maintenance support: Ongoing, with regular check-ins

Conclusion:
This visit has highlighted the need for continued support and guidance for this blended family. By providing counseling services, home maintenance assistance, and parenting classes, we can help alleviate some of the stress associated with their recent relocation and custody changes. Regular follow-up visits will ensure that the family's progress is monitored and that any emerging concerns are addressed promptly.
