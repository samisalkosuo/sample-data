Social Services Visit Report

Date: 28 October 2024
Location: Naantali, Finland
Visit Type: Social reintegration assessment

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct a social reintegration assessment for Ms. Aino Kauriala, a single adult with intellectual disability residing at her family home in Naantali. The assessment aimed to evaluate her current living situation, interactions, and behaviors, as well as identify potential risks and areas for support.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, I observed that Ms. Kauriala was welcoming and cooperative during our conversation. She demonstrated basic self-care skills, including personal hygiene and meal preparation. Her living space was tidy, with minimal clutter, indicating a relatively stable environment. However, I noted some signs of disorganization in her kitchen and laundry areas.

During the assessment, Ms. Kauriala shared her daily routines, social interactions, and emotional state. She reported feeling generally happy and content, but expressed occasional feelings of loneliness and frustration when unable to participate in activities due to her disability. Her family members were supportive and accommodating, providing assistance with daily tasks as needed.

Notable concerns included Ms. Kauriala's limited access to recreational activities and social events, which may exacerbate feelings of isolation. Additionally, I observed some signs of anxiety and stress when discussing financial matters or navigating complex administrative processes.

Assessment:
Based on the assessment, it appears that Ms. Kauriala is living in a relatively stable environment with supportive family members. However, her intellectual disability and limited social interactions may increase her vulnerability to feelings of loneliness and isolation. The low case severity suggests that she requires minimal support, but ongoing monitoring and follow-up are still necessary to ensure her well-being.

Family dynamics were positive, with the family members demonstrating empathy and understanding towards Ms. Kauriala's needs. However, it was noted that they may require additional education and training on supporting individuals with intellectual disabilities in order to provide more effective assistance.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
Based on this assessment, I recommend:

1. Ongoing monitoring of Ms. Kauriala's living situation and social interactions through regular visits.
2. Referral to local recreational activities and social events specifically designed for individuals with intellectual disabilities.
3. Support services for family members, including training and education on supporting individuals with intellectual disabilities.
4. Review of financial matters and administrative processes to ensure Ms. Kauriala's access to necessary resources.
