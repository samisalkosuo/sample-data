Social Services Visit Report

Date: 18 January 2025
Location: Hirvensalmi, Finland
Visit Type: Homeless Outreach Visit

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct a homeless outreach assessment for Mrs. Maria Lehtonen, an elderly woman living in Hirvensalmi, Finland. The visit aimed to assess her current situation, provide support, and connect her with relevant services to address her needs.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival at the designated location (address: Kruununhaka 12, Hirvensalmi), I met Mrs. Lehtonen in the living room. She appeared disoriented and had difficulty recalling recent events due to early dementia symptoms. Her living conditions were basic, with limited furniture and no personal belongings visible. The apartment was clean, but there were signs of neglect, such as unemptied trash cans and a lack of fresh water.

During our conversation, Mrs. Lehtonen expressed feelings of loneliness and isolation. She reported having few social interactions outside the home and relied heavily on her caregiver for daily tasks. Her emotional state appeared anxious, with occasional outbursts of frustration.

Assessment:
Given the low case severity, the situation appears manageable with support from local services. However, Mrs. Lehtonen's dementia symptoms and lack of social connections pose risks to her well-being. It is essential to address these concerns promptly to prevent further decline in her mental and physical health.

Family dynamics were not a significant concern during this visit, as there was no family member present. The caregiver reported being overwhelmed with the demands of caring for Mrs. Lehtonen alone.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Referral to local dementia support groups: I will arrange for Mrs. Lehtonen to participate in a local dementia support group, which will provide her with social interaction and emotional support.
2. Home care services: The caregiver will be connected with home care services to receive assistance with daily tasks and provide respite care.
3. Housing assessment: A housing assessment will be conducted to explore options for Mrs. Lehtonen's long-term accommodation, taking into account her dementia symptoms and need for social interaction.
4. Follow-up visit: A follow-up visit is scheduled for 6 weeks from the date of this report to assess the effectiveness of the recommended actions.

Timeline:

* Referral to dementia support group: Within the next 2 days
* Home care services: To be arranged within the next week
* Housing assessment: Scheduled for 10 February 2025
* Follow-up visit: Scheduled for 18 March 2025
