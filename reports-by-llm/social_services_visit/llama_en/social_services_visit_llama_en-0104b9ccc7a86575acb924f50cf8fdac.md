Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct an emergency housing verification for a transitional housing resident in Asikkala, Finland. The resident, Ms. Maria Lehtonen, had been referred to social services due to concerns about her living situation and potential risk to herself or others.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, I met with Ms. Lehtonen at her assigned apartment in the transitional housing facility. She appeared anxious and hesitant to discuss her situation, but provided some information about her recent struggles with addiction and mental health issues. The apartment was clean and well-maintained, but there were signs of disorganization and clutter. Ms. Lehtonen reported feeling overwhelmed by household chores and struggling to manage her finances.

During our conversation, I observed that Ms. Lehtonen seemed to be in a state of emotional distress, frequently becoming tearful and agitated. She expressed concerns about her ability to cope with daily tasks and felt isolated from friends and family due to her addiction issues. Notable concerns included her lack of access to reliable transportation and limited social support networks.

The assessment highlights the importance of addressing her emotional state, providing access to reliable transportation, and connecting her with social support networks.
