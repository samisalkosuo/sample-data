Social Services Visit Report

Date: 28 March 2025
Location: Harjavalta, Finland
Visit Type: Juvenile Probation Compliance Visit

Summary of Visit Purpose:
This visit was conducted to assess the compliance of [Client Name], a juvenile on probation, with the conditions set by the court. The case severity is classified as low, indicating that the situation does not pose an immediate risk to the client or others.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival at the address 123 Kruununhaka Street, Harjavalta, I met [Client Name], a 16-year-old male, who was accompanied by their adult caregiver. The living conditions were satisfactory, with basic amenities and minimal clutter. However, the caregiver's severe mental health condition was evident in their disheveled appearance and erratic behavior.

During our conversation, [Client Name] demonstrated good understanding of their probation requirements and provided documentation to support this. They reported regular attendance at school and participation in extracurricular activities. The caregiver, while struggling with their condition, appeared to be supportive and cooperative.

Notable concerns arose during the visit when the caregiver's behavior became increasingly agitated, leading to a brief power struggle between them and [Client Name]. This incident highlighted the need for additional support and resources to address the caregiver's mental health needs.

Assessment:
The overall assessment is that the situation remains stable, with minimal risk to [Client Name] or others. However, the caregiver's condition requires ongoing attention and support to prevent escalation. The juvenile's compliance with probation conditions has been satisfactory, but regular monitoring will be necessary to ensure continued progress.

Family dynamics appear strained due to the caregiver's mental health issues, which may impact [Client Name]'s emotional well-being. It is essential to provide additional support and resources to address these concerns and promote a more stable environment for both parties.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Referral to local mental health services: Arrange for the caregiver to receive ongoing counseling and therapy to manage their condition.
2. Support group attendance: Encourage [Client Name] to participate in a support group for young people with family members experiencing mental health issues.
3. Regular home visits: Schedule bi-weekly home visits to monitor the situation, provide guidance, and offer additional support as needed.
4. Review of probation conditions: Schedule a follow-up meeting with [Client Name] and their probation officer to review their progress and adjust the probation plan if necessary.

Timeline for further visits:

* Bi-weekly home visits will commence on 11 April 2025 and continue until 30 June 2025, with a final assessment scheduled for 15 July 2025.
* Regular check-ins with [Client Name] and their probation officer will be conducted to monitor progress and adjust the probation plan as needed.
