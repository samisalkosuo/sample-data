Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct a homeless outreach assessment for a single father, Mr. Juhani Lehtonen, and his child, aged 10, residing at the address below. The case has been identified as high-risk due to their precarious living situation and potential vulnerability to exploitation or harm.

Address: Kustaanmäentie 12, Eckerö, FI-89900

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, Mr. Lehtonen was visibly anxious and hesitant to engage in conversation. He appeared disheveled and had limited access to basic necessities such as food and hygiene facilities. The child showed signs of distress, exhibiting behavioral issues and appearing malnourished.

During the assessment, it became apparent that Mr. Lehtonen has been struggling with addiction and mental health issues, which have significantly impacted his ability to provide for himself and his child. He reported feeling overwhelmed by the demands of single parenthood and lacking access to essential services such as healthcare and social support.

Notable concerns included:

* The state of their living conditions, with evidence of poor sanitation and inadequate heating
* Mr. Lehtonen's self-reported addiction and mental health struggles, which may be exacerbating his situation
