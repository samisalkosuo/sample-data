Social Services Visit Report

Date: 03.06.2025
Location: Tuusula, Finland
Visit Type: Refugee Integration Support Visit

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to assess the well-being and integration needs of the refugee family residing in Tuusula. The teenage mother and infant are part of a low-severity case, indicating that the family is generally stable and able to meet their basic needs.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival at the address, 12300 LÃ¤nsimiehku, Tuusula, I was greeted by the parents, Mr. and Mrs. Ali, who welcomed me warmly. The teenage mother, Amira, was also present, accompanied by her infant child. The living conditions were clean and tidy, with a well-organized kitchen and a cozy living area.

During our conversation, it became clear that the family is adjusting to life in Finland, although they still face some challenges. Amira expressed concerns about accessing healthcare services and navigating the Finnish education system for her child. Mr. and Mrs. Ali reported difficulties finding employment due to language barriers and limited job opportunities.

The family's emotional state was generally positive, with a sense of gratitude towards the social services provided by the refugee integration support program. However, there were moments of frustration and anxiety, particularly when discussing their future plans and financial stability.

Assessment:
Based on my observations and conversations during the visit, I assessed that the family is making progress in integrating into Finnish society. While they still face challenges, their resilience and adaptability are evident. The low-severity case context suggests that the family's situation is stable, with no immediate concerns for safety or well-being.

However, it is essential to continue monitoring the family's progress and providing support to address any emerging issues. Regular follow-up visits will be necessary to ensure that Amira and her child receive adequate education and healthcare services, as well as assistance in finding employment opportunities.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Schedule a follow-up visit within 6 weeks to assess the family's continued integration progress.
2. Arrange for an interpreter to accompany Amira during future visits to facilitate communication with social services staff.
3. Provide information on local job training programs and language courses, and offer support in accessing these resources.
4. Facilitate connections between the family and relevant healthcare providers, including pediatricians and mental health professionals.

Timeline:

* Follow-up visit: 03.10.2025
* Next referral or intervention: As needed, based on ongoing assessments and family dynamics.
