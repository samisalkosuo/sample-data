Social Services Visit Report

Date: 06.11.2024
Location: Hartola, Finland
Visit Type: Unaccompanied Minor Intake Assessment

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct an intake assessment for a critical case involving an unaccompanied minor who is aging out of the foster system. The visit aimed to gather information about the youth's current living situation, emotional state, and potential risks associated with their transition.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival at the address provided (Kirkonkyl√§nkatu 12, 38400 Hartola), I was greeted by the minor, identified as Aino Lehtonen. Aino appeared anxious and hesitant to engage in conversation, but eventually opened up about her living situation.

The residence is a small, one-bedroom apartment located above a family-owned business. The space is cluttered with personal belongings, and there are signs of disorganization. Aino reported that she shares the space with two roommates, both of whom work long hours and leave her to manage the household alone.

During our conversation, I observed Aino exhibiting behaviors indicative of stress and anxiety, including fidgeting and avoiding eye contact. She expressed concerns about her ability to cope with the transition to independent living and fear of being rejected by family members or struggling to find employment.

Assessment:
Given the critical case severity, it is clear that Aino requires immediate support and guidance to ensure a safe and successful transition. The current living situation poses significant risks, including potential fire hazards due to the cluttered condition of the apartment. Furthermore, Aino's emotional state suggests a need for counseling services to address her anxiety and stress.

The family dynamics in this case are complex, with Aino's parents having passed away when she was young. Her guardians, who have been involved in her care since then, seem overwhelmed and uncertain about their ability to support Aino as she ages out of the foster system.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Immediate referral to a local crisis center for counseling services to address Aino's anxiety and stress.
2. Assistance with finding alternative housing options that prioritize safety and organization.
3. Connection with employment resources to help Aino develop job skills and secure stable employment.
4. Regular follow-up visits to monitor Aino's progress, provide ongoing support, and adjust the plan as needed.

Timeline for Follow-up Visits:

* Within 2 weeks: Schedule a follow-up visit to assess Aino's housing situation and provide guidance on finding alternative accommodations.
* Within 6 weeks: Conduct a second follow-up visit to evaluate Aino's employment prospects and offer support with job placement.
* Ongoing: Regular phone checks and email updates will be maintained to ensure Aino receives necessary support and resources.
