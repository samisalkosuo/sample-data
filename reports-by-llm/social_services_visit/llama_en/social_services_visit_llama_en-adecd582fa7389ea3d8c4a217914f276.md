Social Services Visit Report

Date: 24 July 2025
Location: Juuka, Finland
Visit Type: Child Welfare Check
Case Severity: Urgent

Summary of Visit Purpose:
This visit was conducted to assess the well-being and safety of a child living with their non-custodial relative in Juuka, Finland. The case was classified as urgent due to concerns raised by previous contacts regarding potential neglect and lack of supervision.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival, I met with the non-custodial relative, Ms. Maria Lehtonen, who reported that she had been caring for her 7-year-old child, Aino, since their parents' separation. The living conditions were found to be satisfactory, with a clean and well-maintained apartment. However, there were concerns regarding the lack of adult supervision during outdoor activities.

During my interaction with Aino, I observed that she was generally happy and engaged, but seemed hesitant to participate in certain activities due to fear of falling or getting hurt. Her emotional state appeared stable, but I noted a slight increase in anxiety when discussing her parents' separation.

Notable concerns included the lack of adult supervision during outdoor playtime, which raised concerns about Aino's safety. Additionally, Ms. Lehtonen reported that she was struggling to provide adequate financial support for Aino's needs, citing limited employment opportunities and high living costs in Juuka.

Assessment:
The assessment suggests that while the living conditions are satisfactory, there are significant risks to Aino's physical and emotional well-being due to inadequate supervision and lack of adult support. The case severity is maintained due to the urgent nature of these concerns, which require immediate attention to ensure Aino's safety and well-being.

Family dynamics were found to be strained, with Ms. Lehtonen expressing feelings of isolation and frustration regarding her ability to provide for Aino's needs. It is essential to address these underlying issues to prevent further strain on the child and promote a more stable family environment.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Immediate referral to local social services for support with financial assistance and employment guidance.
2. Collaboration with Juuka Municipal Child Protection Services to conduct regular home visits and monitor Aino's safety and well-being.
3. Arrangement of counseling sessions for Ms. Lehtonen to address her emotional needs and develop coping strategies for managing the challenges of single parenthood.
4. Follow-up visit within two weeks to assess progress, provide ongoing support, and re-evaluate the situation.

Timeline:

* 24 July 2025: Initial visit and assessment
* 8 August 2025: First follow-up visit to monitor progress and adjust recommendations as needed
