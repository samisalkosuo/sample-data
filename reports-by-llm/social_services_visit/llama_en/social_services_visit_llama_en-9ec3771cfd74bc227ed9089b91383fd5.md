Social Services Visit Report

Date: 08.06.2025
Location: Savonlinna, Finland
Visit Type: Household Financial Hardship Review

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct a review of the financial hardship faced by the family, with a focus on addressing the underlying causes and providing support to mitigate the risks associated with chronic domestic violence. The visit aimed to assess the current situation, identify potential resources, and develop a plan for further intervention.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival at the address, 12300 Kruununhaka, Savonlinna, Finland (Korundi, 1), I observed a family of four residing in a modest apartment. The mother, Ms. Aino Lehtonen, and her two children, aged 12 and 15, were present during the visit. Mr. Lehtonen was not at home due to work commitments.

Ms. Lehtonen reported that the family has been struggling financially for several months, with reduced income and increased expenses. She expressed concerns about the impact of financial hardship on her children's well-being and education. The family's living conditions were found to be satisfactory, with basic amenities available.

Notable concerns included:

* Ms. Lehtonen's emotional state appeared strained, with visible signs of anxiety and stress.
* The children displayed subdued behavior, suggesting potential effects of chronic domestic violence exposure.
* Limited access to financial resources and support services was evident.

Assessment:
The situation is characterized as moderate in terms of severity. While the family faces significant financial challenges, there are no immediate safety concerns or severe risks to the well-being of the children. However, the presence of chronic domestic violence history and its ongoing impact on the family dynamics warrants continued monitoring and support.

Recommendations:

1. Financial assistance: The Social Services department will provide temporary financial assistance to help alleviate some of the family's expenses.
2. Counseling services: Referrals have been made for individual counseling sessions with Ms. Lehtonen and her children, focusing on emotional well-being and coping strategies.
3. Support groups: Local support groups for families affected by domestic violence will be recommended to provide a safe space for discussion and networking.
4. Follow-up visits: Regular follow-up visits will be scheduled to monitor the family's progress, address any emerging concerns, and adjust the support plan as needed.

Timeline:

* Next follow-up visit: 12 weeks from today
* Review of financial assistance: 6 months from today
