Social Services Visit Report

Date: 24 February 2025
Location: Hirvensalmi, Finland
Visit Type: Parenting Education Follow-up

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct a follow-up assessment on the parenting education program for [Client Name], a teenager with school attendance issues. The visit aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the support provided and identify any areas requiring further intervention.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival, I met with [Client Name]'s parent, Ms. Maria Lehtonen, who reported that her child has been struggling with motivation and focus in school. She expressed concerns about [Client Name]'s increasing isolation from friends and family, which she attributes to the child's growing frustration with academic demands.

During our conversation, I observed a tense atmosphere, with [Client Name] appearing withdrawn and uninterested in discussing their school experiences. Ms. Lehtonen seemed overwhelmed by her role as a single parent, struggling to balance work and childcare responsibilities.

The living conditions were satisfactory, with clean and well-maintained premises. However, the home environment lacked stimulation, with limited access to recreational activities or hobbies outside of school hours.

Assessment:
Based on the observations during this visit, I assess the situation as moderate in severity. [Client Name]'s school attendance issues and increasing isolation pose a risk to their emotional well-being and academic success. Ms. Lehtonen's stress levels and lack of support networks contribute to the family dynamics' instability.

Recommendations:

1. Referral to additional counseling services for [Client Name] to address underlying emotional concerns and develop coping strategies.
2. Collaboration with local schools to create a personalized learning plan, incorporating extracurricular activities and interests to enhance motivation and engagement.
3. Support for Ms. Lehtonen through the Single Parent Support Group at the Hirvensalmi Community Center, providing access to resources, networking opportunities, and emotional support.

Follow-up:
A follow-up visit is scheduled for 15 March 2025 to assess the implementation of these recommendations and evaluate [Client Name]'s progress in addressing their school attendance issues.
