Social Services Visit Report

Date: 29.10.2024
Location: Mynämäki, Finland
Visit Type: Routine family wellbeing visit
Case Severity: Moderate

Summary of Visit Purpose:
This routine family wellbeing visit was conducted to assess the current situation and dynamics within the blended family household in Mynämäki, following recent custody changes. The primary objective was to evaluate the well-being of all family members and identify any potential concerns or risks that may require further support.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival at the residence, I observed a calm atmosphere with minimal signs of conflict. However, it became apparent that the family had recently experienced significant stress due to the custody changes. The parents, Juhani and Leena, appeared visibly tired and preoccupied, while their children, 12-year-old Emma and 9-year-old Lucas, seemed anxious and withdrawn.

During our conversation, I noted that Juhani and Leena were struggling to establish a new routine and boundaries within the household. They expressed concerns about maintaining open communication with each other and managing their own emotions in the face of ongoing stress. The children appeared to be adapting to the changes, but their emotional state was evident in their behavior.

I observed some signs of resilience within the family, such as Leena's efforts to maintain a sense of normalcy through daily routines and activities. However, I also noted that Juhani's recent absence from home due to work commitments had created an uneven distribution of responsibilities, potentially exacerbating tensions.

Assessment:
Given the moderate case severity, it is essential to acknowledge both the strengths and challenges within this blended family. While there are signs of resilience and adaptability, the ongoing stress related to custody changes poses a risk to the emotional well-being of all family members. It is crucial that Juhani and Leena prioritize open communication, boundary-setting, and mutual support to mitigate these risks.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Referral for Family Counselling: I recommend that Juhani and Leena attend family counselling sessions to develop effective communication strategies and work through their emotions in a supportive environment.
2. Parenting Support Services: The family may benefit from parenting classes or workshops focused on blended families, co-parenting, and managing stress.
3. Regular Progress Monitoring: Future visits will be scheduled every 6-8 weeks to monitor the family's progress, provide ongoing support, and address any emerging concerns.

Timeline for Further Visits:

* Next visit: 15.12.2024
* Follow-up visit: 20.03.2025

Conclusion:
This routine family wellbeing visit has provided valuable insights into the current situation within the blended family household in Mynämäki. By acknowledging both strengths and challenges, we can work collaboratively with Juhani and Leena to develop strategies for mitigating risks and promoting a more stable and supportive environment for all family members.
