Social Services Visit Report

Date: 18 October 2024
Location: Kangasala, Finland
Visit Type: Domestic relocation follow-up
Case Severity: Low

Summary of Visit Purpose:
This visit was conducted to assess the well-being of a family relocated from their previous residence due to domestic violence. The grandparents, Mr. and Mrs. Kauriala, were relocated to their current home in Kangasala with their grandchildren, Aki and Lotta, following a court-ordered relocation order. The purpose of this visit was to evaluate the living conditions, interactions between family members, and overall situation to ensure the children's safety and well-being.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, I observed that the grandparents were welcoming and cooperative during the interview. They provided information about their daily routines, including childcare responsibilities and household chores. The grandchildren, Aki (8) and Lotta (6), seemed happy and engaged in their activities, such as playing with toys and watching TV together.

The living conditions of the home were satisfactory, with adequate space for the family to move around comfortably. However, there were some concerns regarding the cleanliness and organization of the kitchen area, which could potentially pose a risk if not addressed promptly.

During the interaction, I noticed that Mr. Kauriala occasionally displayed signs of stress and frustration, particularly when discussing his wife's health issues. Mrs. Kauriala appeared to be more composed and supportive, but also seemed overwhelmed at times. The grandparents acknowledged their challenges in managing their daily lives with the added responsibilities of caring for their grandchildren.

Assessment:
Based on my observations and discussions during the visit, I assessed that the situation is stable, and the family's well-being is not currently at risk. However, there are some concerns that require attention to ensure the children's safety and the grandparents' mental health. The grandparents' stress levels and potential burnout need to be monitored closely.

Family dynamics appear to be generally positive, with a strong bond between the grandparents and their grandchildren. However, it is essential to continue supporting the family in managing their daily lives and addressing any emerging issues promptly.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Schedule regular check-ins (every 3 months) to monitor the family's situation and provide ongoing support.
2. Refer the family to local counseling services to address Mr. Kauriala's stress and anxiety, as well as Mrs. Kauriala's emotional well-being.
3. Provide guidance on household organization and cleaning strategies to improve the kitchen area's functionality and safety.
4. Offer assistance with grocery shopping and meal planning to alleviate some of the grandparents' caregiving responsibilities.

Timeline for Further Visits:
The next scheduled visit will be in three months, unless any concerns arise that require earlier intervention.
