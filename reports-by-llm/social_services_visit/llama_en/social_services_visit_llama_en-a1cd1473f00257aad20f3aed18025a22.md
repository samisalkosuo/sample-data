Social Services Visit Report

Visit Date: 15 November 2024
Location: Kalajoki, Finland
Visit Type: Elderly care follow-up
Household Composition: Elderly couple living independently
Case Severity: Moderate

Summary of Visit Purpose:
This visit was conducted as part of an ongoing elderly care follow-up to assess the well-being and safety of Mr. and Mrs. Taavitsainen, a retired couple residing in Kalajoki, Finland. The purpose of this visit was to evaluate their living conditions, interactions, and any concerns that may have arisen since the last assessment.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, I observed that the couple was well-groomed and appeared to be in good spirits. They welcomed me warmly and provided a brief overview of their daily routines. The home was clean and tidy, with no signs of neglect or disorganization. However, I noted that the kitchen area could benefit from some minor adjustments to improve accessibility for both Mr. and Mrs. Taavitsainen.

During our conversation, I observed that the couple was engaged in a lively discussion about their grandchildren's recent activities. They expressed concern about the increasing cost of living in Kalajoki and the availability of local services. However, they also mentioned their satisfaction with the current healthcare system and social services provided to them.

Notable Concerns:
While the couple appeared to be generally well-adjusted, I did notice some signs of fatigue and decreased mobility. Mr. Taavitsainen reported experiencing occasional dizziness and shortness of breath during his daily activities. Mrs. Taavitsainen expressed concern about her husband's increasing reliance on her for assistance with household chores.

Assessment:
Based on the observations and conversations during this visit, I assess that the couple is currently living in a moderate-risk situation. While they appear to be managing their daily lives effectively, there are some concerns regarding Mr. Taavitsainen's health and Mrs. Taavitsainen's increasing burden as caregiver. It is essential to monitor their situation closely to ensure that any potential issues do not escalate.

Family Dynamics:
The couple's relationship appears to be strong and supportive, with a clear division of labor in the household. However, I noted some signs of tension during our conversation, particularly regarding the issue of cost of living in Kalajoki. It is essential to address these concerns directly with the couple to ensure that they receive adequate support and resources.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
Based on this visit, I recommend the following:

1. Regular home visits to monitor Mr. Taavitsainen's health and provide assistance as needed.
2. Referral to local healthcare services for further evaluation and management of his condition.
3. Support with accessing cost-of-living adjustments and other financial resources available in Kalajoki.
4. Ongoing counseling sessions to address any concerns or tensions within the couple.

Timeline:
The next follow-up visit is scheduled for 20 January 2025, six weeks from the date of this report. I will also conduct a home safety assessment to identify potential hazards and provide recommendations for mitigation.
