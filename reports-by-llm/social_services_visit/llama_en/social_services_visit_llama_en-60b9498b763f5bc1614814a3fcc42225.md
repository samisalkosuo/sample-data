Social Services Visit Report

Date: 12.10.2024
Location: Iisalmi, Finland
Visit Type: Homeless Outreach Visit

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct a homeless outreach assessment on an adult individual living in Iisalmi, Finland, who has been identified as being at risk due to their severe mental health condition. The visit aimed to assess the individual's current situation, provide support and resources, and connect them with relevant services.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, the individual was found to be living in a small, cramped apartment located at address 123 Kauppakatu, Iisalmi. The apartment was in disarray, with dirty dishes, unwashed laundry, and trash scattered throughout the space. The individual appeared disheveled and had difficulty maintaining eye contact during our conversation.

During the assessment, it became clear that the individual has been experiencing severe symptoms of anxiety and depression, which have significantly impacted their daily life. They reported feeling isolated and disconnected from their community, with limited social interactions outside of this visit. The individual's mental health condition was exacerbated by a recent loss of employment, leading to feelings of hopelessness and despair.

Assessment:
The situation is considered moderate in severity due to the individual's ongoing struggles with mental health, lack of stable housing, and limited access to support services. However, there are concerns about the potential for rapid deterioration if not addressed promptly. The individual's living conditions and behavior suggest a need for immediate intervention to prevent further decline.

Family Dynamics:
There is no family member present in the household, and the individual reported having few social connections outside of this visit. It is unclear whether they have any formal support network or emergency contacts.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Immediate Referral: The individual will be referred to the Iisalmi Social Services Department for further assessment and connection with relevant mental health services.
2. Housing Support: A housing specialist will work with the individual to explore options for stable, long-term accommodation, potentially through a subsidized rental program or temporary assistance.
3. Mental Health Services: The individual will be connected with local mental health services, including counseling and medication management, to address their ongoing symptoms.
4. Follow-up Visit: A follow-up visit is scheduled for 14 days from the date of this report to assess progress and provide additional support as needed.

Timeline:

* 14 days from report date: Follow-up visit to assess progress and adjust recommendations as necessary
* Ongoing: Regular check-ins with the individual to monitor their mental health, housing situation, and overall well-being
