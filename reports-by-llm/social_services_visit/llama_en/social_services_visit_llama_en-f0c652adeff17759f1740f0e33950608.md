Social Services Visit Report

Date: 13 August 2024
Location: Tervo, Finland
Visit Type: Domestic Violence Risk Assessment

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The visit was conducted to assess the risk of domestic violence in a multi-generational household with financial difficulties, as reported by the local social services department. The family's situation had been identified as high-risk due to their economic struggles and potential for escalating conflicts.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival at the address, 12300 Tervonkatu, 39610 Tervo, Finland, I observed a tense atmosphere within the household. The mother, Ms. Maria Lehtonen (45), appeared visibly shaken and anxious during our conversation. Her husband, Mr. Antti Lehtonen (48), displayed aggressive behavior towards her, using raised voices and physical gestures to emphasize his points.

The living conditions were modest, with signs of financial strain evident in the worn-out furniture and limited household goods. The children, aged 12 and 15, seemed reluctant to engage in conversation, displaying a mix of fear and resignation on their faces.

Ms. Lehtonen reported frequent arguments between her husband and herself, often centered around financial management and household responsibilities. She mentioned that Mr. Lehtonen had become increasingly controlling and dismissive of her opinions, leading to feelings of isolation and hopelessness.

Assessment:
The assessment revealed a high level of risk for domestic violence in this household. The power imbalance between the couple, coupled with Mr. Lehtonen's aggressive behavior, created an environment conducive to escalating conflicts. Ms. Lehtonen's emotional state was characterized by anxiety, fear, and despair, while her children displayed signs of trauma and distress.

The family's financial difficulties had exacerbated the situation, as they struggled to make ends meet and manage their household expenses. This added layer of stress had intensified Mr. Lehtonen's controlling behavior, further eroding Ms. Lehtonen's autonomy and self-esteem.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Immediate Safety Plan: I worked with Ms. Lehtonen to develop a safety plan, including emergency contact numbers, safe locations, and financial resources.
2. Referral to Local Support Services: We arranged for Ms. Lehtonen to receive support from local counseling services, focusing on emotional well-being and empowerment.
3. Financial Assistance: The family was referred to local social services for financial assistance, aiming to alleviate some of the economic strain contributing to their domestic tensions.
4. Court-Ordered Mediation: Given the high risk of domestic violence, I recommended court-ordered mediation sessions to address Mr. Lehtonen's aggressive behavior and promote constructive communication between the couple.
5. Follow-up Visits: We scheduled follow-up visits for every 6 weeks to monitor the family's situation, provide ongoing support, and assess the effectiveness of implemented measures.

Timeline:

* Next visit: 10 September 2024
* Follow-up visits: Every 6 weeks until further notice
