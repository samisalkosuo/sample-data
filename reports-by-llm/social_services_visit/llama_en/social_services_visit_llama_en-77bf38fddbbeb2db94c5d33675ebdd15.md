Social Services Visit Report

Date: 13 November 2024
Location: Kurikka, Finland
Visit Type: Youth Mentoring Program Assessment

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to assess the suitability of a youth mentoring program for a cohabiting couple with mental health challenges residing in Kurikka, Finland. The couple, Juhani and Leena Kauriala, were referred by their local healthcare provider due to concerns about their ability to provide a stable environment for their minor child.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival at the Kauriala residence ( address: Rantakatu 12, 40100 Kurikka), I was greeted by Juhani and Leena. They appeared anxious and hesitant to discuss their situation, but were willing to provide information about their living conditions and family dynamics.

The home environment was generally clean and tidy, with some signs of disorganization in the kitchen area. The couple's mental health challenges were evident in their emotional state, with Juhani exhibiting symptoms of anxiety and Leena displaying signs of depression. Their minor child, a 10-year-old boy named Elias, seemed to be coping well with the situation, but appeared occasionally anxious when discussing his parents' behavior.

Notable concerns included the couple's limited social support network and their reliance on online resources for mental health management. They also reported difficulties in managing daily tasks due to their mental health challenges.

Assessment:
Given the low severity of this case, I assessed that the Kauriala family is capable of providing a stable environment for Elias with some additional support. However, it was clear that they require guidance and resources to manage their mental health challenges effectively.

Family dynamics were complex, with Juhani and Leena struggling to communicate effectively and make joint decisions. Their relationship appeared strained at times, but they both expressed a desire to work together to improve their situation.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
Based on this assessment, I recommend the following:

1. Referral to local mental health services for individual counseling sessions with Juhani and Leena.
2. Connection with a social worker specializing in family dynamics and cohabiting couples.
3. Support for Elias through school-based counseling services to address any anxiety or emotional challenges he may be experiencing.
4. Regular home visits to monitor the couple's progress, provide guidance on daily tasks, and offer emotional support.

Timeline:
- Next visit: 20 November 2024
- Follow-up with local mental health services: 15 December 2024

Conclusion:
The Kauriala family is capable of providing a stable environment for Elias, but requires additional support to manage their mental health challenges effectively. With the recommended actions and follow-up visits, I am confident that this couple can work towards improving their situation and providing a positive environment for their child.
