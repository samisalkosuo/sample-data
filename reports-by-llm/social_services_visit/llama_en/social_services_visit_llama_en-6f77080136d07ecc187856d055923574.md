Social Services Visit Report

Date: 29.04.2025
Location: Järvenpää, Finland
Visit Type: Child Welfare Check
Case Severity: Low

Summary of Visit Purpose:
This visit was conducted as part of an ongoing child welfare check to assess the well-being and safety of the three children residing with their single mother in Järvenpää. The purpose of this visit was to evaluate the living conditions, family dynamics, and overall situation to determine if any additional support or interventions are required.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, I observed a warm and welcoming atmosphere within the household. The single mother, Ms. Lehtinen, greeted me with a smile and provided an overview of her daily routine and the children's activities. The three children, aged 8, 10, and 12, were cooperative and engaged in their studies.

The living conditions were found to be satisfactory, with clean and well-maintained furniture and appliances. However, there were some minor concerns regarding the storage of hazardous materials and the need for additional trash cans. Ms. Lehtinen acknowledged these issues and expressed her intention to address them soon.

During our conversation, I observed that Ms. Lehtinen was emotionally stable and capable of managing the daily responsibilities of caring for her children. She reported feeling overwhelmed at times but was able to manage stress through exercise and social support from friends and family.

Notable Concerns:
While there were no significant concerns raised during this visit, I did notice that the eldest child, aged 12, seemed slightly withdrawn and isolated from his siblings. Ms. Lehtinen mentioned that he had been experiencing some difficulties in school and was struggling to make friends. She expressed her willingness to support him in seeking additional help if needed.

Assessment:
Based on this visit, it appears that the situation is stable, and the family is capable of managing their daily needs. However, there are some minor concerns regarding household management and social isolation that require attention. The single mother's emotional stability and ability to care for her children are a positive aspect of this case.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Schedule a follow-up visit in 6 months to assess the family's progress and address any emerging concerns.
2. Refer Ms. Lehtinen to local community resources, such as parenting classes and social support groups, to help her manage stress and build a stronger support network.
3. Consider providing additional guidance on household management and safety measures to ensure a safe environment for the children.

Timeline:
- 6 months: Follow-up visit to assess family progress
- 9 months: Review of case severity and potential re-evaluation of recommended actions
