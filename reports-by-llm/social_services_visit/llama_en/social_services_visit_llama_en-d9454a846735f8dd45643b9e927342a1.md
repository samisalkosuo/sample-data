Social Services Visit Report

Date: 23 January 2025
Location: Siuntio, Finland
Visit Type: Follow-up on school truancy report

Summary of Visit Purpose:
This visit was conducted to follow up on the school truancy report for a child living with an adult in Siuntio. The purpose of this visit is to assess the situation and provide support to ensure the child's well-being and education.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival, I met with Mrs. Leena Kärkkäinen, a 45-year-old Finnish citizen, who has been living with severe mental health conditions for several years. She resides in a small, one-bedroom apartment at address Kauppatorinkatu 12, 21600 Siuntio.

During the visit, I observed that Mrs. Kärkkäinen was cooperative and open about her condition. She reported experiencing anxiety and depression, which have been exacerbated by the recent school truancy of her child, 10-year-old Juhani. Mrs. Kärkkäinen expressed concern about Juhani's well-being and education, as she believes that his absence from school is affecting his social skills and academic performance.

The living conditions were generally clean and tidy, but there were signs of disorganization and clutter in the apartment. Mrs. Kärkkäinen reported struggling to manage her daily routine due to her mental health condition, which has led to some difficulties with household chores and meal preparation.

Assessment:
Based on my observations, I assessed that the situation is low-severity, as Mrs. Kärkkäinen's mental health condition is well-managed with medication and therapy. However, the school truancy of her child poses a concern for Juhani's education and social development. The household dynamics appear to be strained due to Mrs. Kärkkäinen's condition, but there are no immediate signs of neglect or harm.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Referral to local mental health services: I recommended that Mrs. Kärkkäinen continue her therapy sessions and medication management to ensure stability in her mental health.
2. Support for Juhani's education: I suggested that the school provide additional support for Juhani, such as tutoring or counseling, to help him catch up on his missed schoolwork and develop social skills.
3. Household assistance: I offered to connect Mrs. Kärkkäinen with local household services that can provide temporary assistance with cleaning and meal preparation.
4. Follow-up visit in 6 weeks: I scheduled a follow-up visit to assess the effectiveness of the recommended actions and provide further support as needed.

Next Steps:
I will send a letter to Mrs. Kärkkäinen summarizing our discussion and outlining the recommended actions. The school will be notified about Juhani's truancy and provided with information about the support services available for him.
