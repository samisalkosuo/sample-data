Social Services Visit Report

Date: 07.10.2024
Location: Punkalaidun, Finland
Visit Type: Household Financial Hardship Review

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct a review of the household's financial situation in light of their reported hardship. The single mother and her three children were referred to social services due to concerns about their ability to meet basic needs.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival, I met with Ms. Leena Kärkkäinen, a 35-year-old single mother, at her residence located at Kauppakatu 12, Punkalaidun. The household consists of Ms. Kärkkäinen and her three children, aged 8, 10, and 12.

During the visit, I observed that the living conditions were generally clean and tidy, with no signs of neglect or abuse. However, the household's financial situation was evident in the limited food options available, with mostly canned goods and pasta-based meals. The refrigerator contained a few expired items, and the pantry was nearly empty.

Ms. Kärkkäinen expressed concern about her ability to provide for her children, citing difficulties in finding employment due to her lack of work experience and language skills. She also mentioned that she had been struggling with debt and was worried about losing their home.

The children appeared to be resilient and adaptable, but showed signs of stress and anxiety when discussing their mother's financial situation. The eldest child, aged 12, expressed concern about the impact of poverty on her education and future prospects.

Assessment:
Given the low severity of this case, I assessed that the household is facing significant financial hardship, but there are no immediate concerns for the children's safety or well-being. However, it is essential to provide ongoing support to help Ms. Kärkkäinen access employment opportunities, manage debt, and improve her overall financial stability.

Family dynamics appeared stable, with Ms. Kärkkäinen demonstrating a strong bond with her children. However, the stress of poverty may impact their relationships in the future if left unaddressed.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Employment support: Arrange for Ms. Kärkkäinen to participate in job training programs and provide guidance on resume development and interview skills.
2. Financial counseling: Refer Ms. Kärkkäinen to a local financial advisor who can help her manage debt and create a budget.
3. Food assistance: Provide information about local food banks and other resources that can help supplement their food supply.
4. Follow-up visits: Schedule regular follow-up visits (every 6 months) to monitor the household's progress, provide ongoing support, and address any emerging concerns.

Timeline for further visits:

* Next visit: 12.01.2025
* Follow-up visits: every 6 months until the case is closed
