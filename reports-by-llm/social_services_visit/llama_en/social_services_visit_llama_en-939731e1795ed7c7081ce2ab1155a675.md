Social Services Visit Report

Date: 12.06.2025
Location: Jokioinen, Finland
Visit Type: Parental Capacity Evaluation
Case Severity: Low

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct a parental capacity evaluation for the child living with non-custodial relative, Ms. Maria Lehtonen, at her residence in Jokioinen. The evaluation aimed to assess the suitability of Ms. Lehtonen as a caregiver and determine whether any support or intervention is required to ensure the child's well-being.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, I observed that the living conditions were generally satisfactory, with clean and tidy premises. Ms. Lehtonen provided me with a warm welcome and was cooperative throughout the visit. The child, 7-year-old Emma, seemed happy and engaged during our interactions, participating in conversations and activities.

During the assessment, it became apparent that Ms. Lehtonen has been caring for Emma since her parents' separation. While there were some minor concerns regarding household management and meal planning, these issues were manageable and did not pose a significant risk to the child's safety or well-being.

Notable concerns included Emma's occasional displays of anxiety when discussing her parents' separation, which Ms. Lehtonen acknowledged but seemed uncertain about how to address. Additionally, there was some evidence of inconsistent discipline practices between Ms. Lehtonen and other caregivers involved in Emma's life.

Assessment:
Based on the observations during the visit, it appears that Ms. Lehtonen is capable of providing a stable and loving environment for Emma. However, the child's ongoing emotional distress related to her parents' separation warrants further support and guidance from a mental health professional. The household dynamics also require attention to ensure consistent discipline practices and effective communication among caregivers.

Given the low severity of this case, it is recommended that Ms. Lehtonen receive support and guidance on managing Emma's emotional well-being and developing more consistent discipline practices. A referral to a local counseling service for both Ms. Lehtonen and Emma has been made, with follow-up visits scheduled in three months to assess progress.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Referral to Jokioisten Counseling Service for individual therapy sessions with Ms. Lehtonen and Emma.
2. Regular home visits by social services to monitor household dynamics and provide ongoing support.
3. Collaboration with other caregivers involved in Emma's life to develop a unified approach to discipline and communication.

Timeline:

* Follow-up visit: 12.09.2025
* Next assessment: 15.12.2025
