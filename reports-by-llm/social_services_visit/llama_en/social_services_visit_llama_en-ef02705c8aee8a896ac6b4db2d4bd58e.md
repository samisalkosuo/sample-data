Social Services Visit Report

Visit Date: 31.12.2024
Location: Siikainen, Finland
Visit Type: Safety Plan Monitoring Visit

Summary of Visit Purpose:
This visit was conducted to monitor the safety plan implemented for the family following a previous assessment of risk factors and concerns. The purpose of this visit is to assess the effectiveness of the safety plan in reducing risks and improving the overall well-being of the family.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival, I met with Mr. and Mrs. Kauriala (parents) and their four children (Ages 8, 10, 12, and 14). The family was cooperative and open during the visit. The living conditions were satisfactory, with a warm and welcoming atmosphere. The home was clean, and the children were engaged in various activities.

During our conversation, I observed that the family had been following the safety plan recommendations, including regular communication between parents and children about boundaries and expectations. The children reported feeling safe and supported within their home environment. However, there were some concerns raised regarding the father's occasional use of alcohol, which was noted to be a trigger for increased conflict.

Assessment:
Based on the observations during this visit, I assess that the family is making progress in implementing the safety plan. While there are still risks present, such as the potential for increased conflict when the father uses alcohol, these can be managed with continued support and monitoring. The family's cooperation and commitment to the safety plan have been evident throughout our interactions.

Case Severity:
Given the low severity of this case, I do not foresee any immediate need for further intervention or escalation. However, regular follow-up visits will continue to monitor the family's progress and address any emerging concerns.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Schedule a follow-up visit in 6 months to assess the continued effectiveness of the safety plan.
2. Offer support services for the father to address his alcohol use, such as counseling or support groups.
3. Provide ongoing guidance and resources for the family on managing conflict and maintaining a safe environment.

Timeline for Further Visits:

* Follow-up visit: 30.06.2025
* Next assessment of case severity: 30.06.2025

Conclusion:
This safety plan monitoring visit has provided an opportunity to assess the effectiveness of the implemented safety plan and identify areas for continued support and improvement. The family's cooperation and commitment to the safety plan have been evident, and with ongoing support and monitoring, I am confident that they will continue to make progress in maintaining a safe and supportive environment.
