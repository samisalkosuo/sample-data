Date: 15 June 2025
Location: Simo, Finland
Visit Type: Parenting Education Follow-up

Summary of Visit Purpose:
This visit was conducted as a follow-up to the parenting education program for single caregivers supporting their elderly parent with dementia in Simo, Finland. The purpose of this visit is to assess the caregiver's progress, provide support, and address any concerns that may have arisen since the last visit.

Observations During the Visit:

During the visit, I observed that the caregiver, Mrs. Maria Lehtinen, was able to manage her daily routine effectively, despite the challenges posed by her mother's dementia. The living conditions were clean and hygienic, with adequate access to basic necessities such as food, water, and healthcare services.

Notable interactions between Mrs. Lehtinen and her mother were observed, where the caregiver demonstrated empathy and patience in managing her mother's behavior. However, there were instances of frustration and stress evident on Mrs. Lehtinen's face, particularly when dealing with her mother's agitation and wandering.

The living environment was found to be safe and secure, with no signs of neglect or abuse. The caregiver had established a routine for her mother's care, including regular medication management and social activities.

Assessment:
Based on the observations during the visit, it is clear that Mrs. Lehtinen is making an effort to provide adequate care for her mother despite the challenges posed by dementia. However, there are still concerns regarding her emotional well-being and stress levels.

The case severity is classified as low, indicating that the situation is manageable with support and resources. Further assessment is needed to determine the long-term sustainability of Mrs. Lehtinen's current caregiving arrangement.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Referral to local dementia support groups for Mrs. Lehtinen and her mother.
2. Regular home visits to monitor the caregiver's well-being and provide emotional support.
3. Assistance with accessing respite care services to alleviate stress and fatigue.
4. Review of medication management and social activities to ensure they are tailored to the mother's needs.

Conclusion:
This visit has provided an opportunity for me to assess Mrs. Lehtinen's progress in providing care for her mother with dementia.

Further support and resources will be necessary to ensure the long-term sustainability of this caregiving arrangement.
