Social Services Visit Report

Visit Date: 07.11.2024
Location: Kauhava, Finland
Visit Type: Safety Plan Monitoring Visit

Summary of Visit Purpose:
This visit was conducted to monitor the safety plan in place for the family, consisting of a teenage mother and her infant child living with their parents. The purpose of this visit is to assess the current situation, ensure the family's well-being, and provide support as needed.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival, I observed a warm and welcoming atmosphere within the household. The teenage mother, Aino Luukkainen, was seen engaging in activities with her infant child while her parents, Mr. and Mrs. Kari Kallio, assisted with household chores. The family's living conditions were found to be satisfactory, with adequate space for all members.

During our conversation, Aino expressed gratitude for the support provided by social services, stating that it has helped alleviate some of the stress associated with caring for her child alone. Her parents demonstrated a supportive and involved attitude towards their granddaughter's well-being, often taking turns caring for the infant during the day.

However, I did notice some concerns regarding the family's financial situation. Aino mentioned that they are struggling to make ends meet, with limited access to resources and services. This may pose potential risks to the child's safety and well-being in the future.

Assessment:
Given the low severity of this case, it is evident that the family is currently stable and able to care for themselves. However, ongoing support and monitoring are necessary to ensure their continued well-being. The family's financial situation warrants further attention, as it may impact their ability to provide a safe and nurturing environment for their child.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Schedule regular check-ins with Aino Luukkainen to monitor her progress and address any emerging concerns.
2. Provide the family with information on local resources and services that can assist with financial stability, such as food banks and job training programs.
3. Offer support for Aino's education and career development, which may help improve their economic situation in the long term.
