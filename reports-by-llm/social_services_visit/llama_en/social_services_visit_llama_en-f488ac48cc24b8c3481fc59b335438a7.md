Social Services Visit Report

Date: 07.03.2025
Location: Keuruu, Finland
Visit Type: Household Financial Hardship Review

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct a review of the financial hardship situation in the multi-generational household at address 123 Kylpyl√§ntie, Keuruu, Finland. The referral indicated moderate case severity and concerns regarding the family's ability to meet basic needs.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival, I observed a warm but tense atmosphere within the household. The family of four, consisting of two adults (Juhani, 45, and Maria, 42) and their two children (Lotta, 12, and Joonas, 9), welcomed me with caution. During our conversation, it became apparent that financial difficulties have been a persistent issue for the past year, affecting their ability to pay bills on time.

The living conditions were modest but clean, with some signs of wear and tear evident in the furniture and appliances. The family reported struggling to make ends meet, with Juhani's job as a manual laborer providing limited income. Maria, who works part-time as a caregiver, also mentioned difficulties in balancing work and family responsibilities.

Notable concerns included the children's emotional state, which appeared to be affected by their parents' stress and uncertainty about their financial future. The family reported feeling isolated and struggling to access support services due to language barriers (Maria is from Estonia).

Assessment:
The assessment revealed a complex web of intergenerational relationships, with multiple caregivers contributing to the household income. However, the family's financial situation remains precarious, with limited savings and no clear plan for long-term stability.

Risks identified during this visit include:

* Food insecurity: The family reported difficulty affording basic groceries, particularly meat and dairy products.
* Housing instability: The lease is up for renewal in three months, and the family is uncertain about their ability to secure a new rental property.
* Emotional well-being: The children's stress levels are high, and the adults' mental health appears to be affected by financial pressure.

Family dynamics were observed to be strained, with disagreements between Juhani and Maria regarding household finances. However, both parents expressed a desire to work together to address their financial difficulties and provide a stable environment for their children.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Referral to local food bank services to support the family's basic needs.
2. Assistance in securing affordable housing options through the Keuruu City Housing Authority.
3. Connection with a Finnish language support group for Maria, providing access to resources and social connections.
4. Regular home visits to monitor the family's situation and provide emotional support.
