Social Services Visit Report

Location: Sund, Finland
Visit Type: Domestic Violence Risk Assessment

Summary of Visit Purpose:
This visit was conducted to assess the risk of domestic violence in the household of Ms. Maria Lehtinen and her live-in caregiver, Mr. Juhani Kärkkäinen, due to concerns raised by neighbors regarding suspicious behavior and potential isolation.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival, I observed that the household was tidy, but there were signs of neglect in the kitchen area, including expired food and dirty dishes. The disabled adult, Ms. Lehtinen, was seated on a couch, while Mr. Kärkkäinen was preparing dinner in the kitchen. Their interactions seemed strained, with Mr. Kärkkäinen frequently interrupting Ms. Lehtinen's conversations with visitors.

During our conversation, I noticed that Ms. Lehtinen appeared anxious and fearful, often glancing at her caregiver as if seeking reassurance. Mr. Kärkkäinen, on the other hand, seemed defensive and dismissive of concerns about his behavior. He denied any wrongdoing, stating that he was simply trying to care for Ms. Lehtinen's needs.

Emotional State:
Ms. Lehtinen expressed feelings of isolation and confinement, stating that she had been unable to leave the house due to her disability. She also mentioned that Mr. Kärkkäinen controlled her finances and limited her access to outside contacts. These statements raised concerns about potential emotional abuse and financial exploitation.

Notable Concerns:
I observed signs of physical neglect, including unhygienic conditions in the bathroom and a lack of fresh linens. The household's isolation from friends and family was also concerning, as Ms. Lehtinen mentioned that she had not spoken to her children in months.

Assessment:
Given the case severity of "Urgent," I assessed that the situation posed an immediate risk to Ms. Lehtinen's physical and emotional well-being. The power imbalance between Mr. Kärkkäinen and Ms. Lehtinen, combined with signs of neglect and isolation, suggested a high likelihood of domestic violence.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Immediate Referral: I referred Ms. Lehtinen to the Sund Social Services Department's Domestic Violence Unit for further assessment and support.
2. Emergency Shelter Placement: Due to the urgent nature of the situation, I recommended that Ms. Lehtinen be placed in a temporary emergency shelter to ensure her safety.
3. Financial Support: I arranged for financial assistance to be provided to Ms. Lehtinen, allowing her to regain control over her finances and access outside contacts.
4. Follow-up Visits: I scheduled follow-up visits with Ms. Lehtinen every two weeks to monitor her situation and provide ongoing support.

Timeline:

* 14 days from the date of this report, a follow-up visit will be conducted to assess Ms. Lehtinen's progress and adjust recommendations as necessary.
* 30 days from the date of this report, a comprehensive assessment of Mr. Kärkkäinen's behavior and potential involvement in domestic violence will be conducted.
