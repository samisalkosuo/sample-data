Social Services Visit Report

Date: 31 January 2025
Location: Askola, Finland
Visit Type: Foster family evaluation

Summary of Visit Purpose:
This visit was conducted to evaluate the foster family's ability to provide a safe and supportive environment for Mrs. Maria Lehtinen, an elderly woman with early dementia symptoms. The purpose of this assessment is to ensure that the foster family can meet her ongoing care needs and provide necessary support.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival, I observed Mrs. Lehtinen in the living room, where she was engaged in a conversation with the foster mother, Ms. Sofia Lindström. The atmosphere was warm and welcoming, with Mrs. Lehtinen laughing and smiling during their interaction. However, I noted that Ms. Lindström seemed slightly anxious, checking on Mrs. Lehtinen's medication schedule and ensuring her safety throughout the visit.

The living conditions were clean and tidy, with minimal clutter. The foster family had taken steps to create a dementia-friendly environment, including using visual aids and providing regular reminders for daily routines. I observed that Mrs. Lehtinen was able to navigate the home relatively easily, although she occasionally became disoriented in certain areas.

Notable concerns included Mrs. Lehtinen's tendency to wander off on her own, which posed a risk of falls or getting lost. Ms. Lindström had taken steps to address this issue by installing handrails and securing loose items around the home. However, I recommended that additional safety measures be implemented, such as a wearable alarm system.

Assessment:
Based on my observations, it appears that the foster family is committed to providing Mrs. Lehtinen with a safe and supportive environment. While there are some concerns regarding her dementia symptoms, the family's efforts to create a dementia-friendly home and provide necessary support have been commendable. The case severity is classified as low, indicating that Mrs. Lehtinen's needs can be met within the foster care system.

Family dynamics were positive, with Ms. Lindström demonstrating patience and understanding towards Mrs. Lehtinen's cognitive decline. However, I noted that there were moments of frustration when Mrs. Lehtinen became agitated or resistant to her medication schedule. It is essential for the foster family to continue providing emotional support and reassurance during these challenging times.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Install a wearable alarm system to enhance safety measures.
2. Provide additional training on dementia care and management for Ms. Lindström.
3. Schedule regular check-ins with Mrs. Lehtinen's healthcare provider to monitor her condition and adjust treatment plans as needed.
4. Consider referring Mrs. Lehtinen to local support groups for individuals with dementia and their caregivers.

Timeline:

* Follow-up visit: 15 February 2025
* Review of medication schedule and dosage adjustments (if necessary): 28 February 2025

Conclusion:
This foster family evaluation has provided valuable insights into the care and well-being of Mrs. Maria Lehtinen. With continued support and guidance, I am confident that this family can provide a safe and nurturing environment for her ongoing needs.
