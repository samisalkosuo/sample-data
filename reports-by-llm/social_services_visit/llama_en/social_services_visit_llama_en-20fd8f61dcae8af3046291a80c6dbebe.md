Social Services Visit Report

Date: 14 November 2024
Location: Alavieska, Finland
Visit Type: Support Plan Review Meeting

Summary of Visit Purpose:
This visit was conducted to review the support plan for a separated couple with shared custody, as per the case severity level. The purpose of this meeting was to assess the current situation, identify any changes or concerns, and provide guidance on how to move forward.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival at the residence in 23 Kruununhakaantie, Alavieska, I met with both parents, Juhani and Maria. The atmosphere was tense, with a noticeable lack of communication between them. They had agreed to meet for the review meeting, but it was clear that they were not on the same page regarding their co-parenting responsibilities.

The living conditions were satisfactory, with basic necessities available. However, there were signs of stress and anxiety in the home, including unopened mail and unwashed dishes. The children, aged 8 and 10, seemed to be coping well, but I observed them avoiding eye contact and displaying subtle behavioral changes when their parents disagreed.

Assessment:
Given the high case severity level, it is evident that this family is struggling to cope with the separation. The lack of communication between Juhani and Maria has resulted in a power imbalance, where one parent dominates decision-making, leading to feelings of resentment and frustration among both parties. This has created an environment where the children are walking on eggshells, trying not to take sides or get caught up in their parents' conflicts.

The current co-parenting plan is not working effectively, with each parent having limited contact with the children. I am concerned about the potential long-term effects of this situation on the children's emotional well-being and relationships with both parents.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Referral to Family Mediation Services: I recommend that Juhani and Maria attend a family mediation session to work towards a more collaborative co-parenting plan.
2. Parenting Classes: Both parents would benefit from attending parenting classes to improve their communication skills and learn effective conflict resolution strategies.
3. Regular Progress Updates: I will schedule regular progress updates with both parents to monitor the effectiveness of the new co-parenting plan and provide support as needed.
4. Child-Focused Interventions: Given the children's behavioral changes, I suggest that they receive child-focused interventions to address any emotional or psychological distress they may be experiencing.

Timeline for Further Visits:

* Next visit: 28 November 2024
* Follow-up visits: Every 6 weeks until further notice
