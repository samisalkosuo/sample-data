Social Services Visit Report

Date: 18 July 2025
Location: Enonkoski, Finland
Visit Type: At-risk youth intervention visit

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to assess the well-being of a single caregiver supporting an elderly parent with dementia in their home. The visit aimed to identify potential risks and provide support to ensure the safety and dignity of both individuals.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival, I observed that the caregiver, Ms. Maria Lehtonen, appeared stressed and overwhelmed due to the demands of caring for her mother. She reported feeling isolated and lacking social support, which exacerbated her emotional state. The elderly parent with dementia, Mrs. Sofia Lehtonen, was found to be experiencing moderate agitation and confusion, requiring frequent assistance with daily tasks.

The living conditions were generally clean and tidy, but there were signs of neglect in the kitchen area, where food had been left uneaten for several days. Ms. Maria reported struggling to manage her mother's medication regimen, leading to concerns about potential overdose or underdose risks.

During our conversation, I observed that Ms. Maria was hesitant to discuss her feelings and emotions, suggesting a lack of trust in social services. However, she did express gratitude for the visit and acknowledged the need for support.

Assessment:
The situation appears moderate in terms of risk, with concerns about caregiver burnout, neglect, and potential health risks associated with inadequate medication management. The elderly parent's dementia diagnosis and increasing dependence on caregivers create a vulnerable situation. It is essential to provide Ms. Maria with emotional support, practical assistance, and guidance on managing her mother's care.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Referral to local caregiver support groups to help Ms. Maria connect with peers and access resources.
2. Arrangement of regular home visits by a social worker to monitor the situation, provide emotional support, and offer practical assistance.
3. Collaboration with the healthcare team to review medication management and develop strategies for improving adherence.
4. Exploration of respite care options to alleviate caregiver burnout and ensure Ms. Maria's own well-being.

Timeline:

* Next home visit: 15 August 2025
* Follow-up appointment with the healthcare team: 22 July 2025

Conclusion:
This visit highlighted the need for targeted support to address the complex needs of Ms. Maria and her mother. By providing emotional support, practical assistance, and guidance on managing care, we can help mitigate risks and improve their overall well-being.
