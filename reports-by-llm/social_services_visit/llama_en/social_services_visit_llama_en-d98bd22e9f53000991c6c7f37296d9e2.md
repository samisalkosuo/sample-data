Social Services Visit Report

Date: 15.12.2024
Location: Riihim√§ki, Finland
Visit Type: Newborn and Infant Safety Visit

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to assess the safety and well-being of a newborn infant in a household where the mother is recovering from domestic abuse. The visit aimed to identify potential risks and provide support to ensure a safe environment for both the mother and her child.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival, I met with Ms. Aino Virtanen, a 25-year-old single mother who had recently given birth to a healthy baby boy. She was visibly shaken but cooperative during our conversation. The living conditions of the apartment were satisfactory, with basic furniture and essential household items. However, there were signs of recent stress and anxiety, including unmade beds and scattered laundry.

During our interaction, Ms. Virtanen expressed concerns about her safety and that of her child, citing ongoing threats from an ex-partner. She reported feeling isolated and struggling to access support services due to language barriers and lack of familiarity with local resources. The infant was observed to be healthy and well-cared for, but the mother's emotional state was evident in her frequent sighs and tears.

Assessment:
Given the low case severity, the overall risk assessment indicates a moderate level of concern. While Ms. Virtanen's situation is precarious, there are no immediate threats to the child's safety or well-being. However, it is essential to provide ongoing support to address the mother's emotional needs and ensure her access to necessary resources.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Referral to local domestic violence support services: I will arrange for Ms. Virtanen to receive counseling and advocacy support from a trusted organization.
2. Language assistance: I will connect Ms. Virtanen with a language instructor to help her improve her Finnish skills, facilitating access to local resources.
3. Home safety assessment: A follow-up visit will be scheduled to assess the home environment and provide recommendations for improving safety and reducing risks.
4. Regular check-ins: Bi-weekly phone calls will be established to monitor Ms. Virtanen's well-being and provide emotional support.

Timeline:

* Next follow-up visit: 5.1.2025
* Referral to domestic violence support services: arranged within the next two weeks
