Social Services Visit Report

Date: 02.09.2024
Location: Kivij채rvi, Finland
Visit Type: Refugee Integration Support Visit

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to assess the well-being and integration needs of a child living with a non-custodial relative in Kivij채rvi, Finland. The case is classified as high severity due to concerns about the child's emotional state and potential risks associated with their current living situation.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival at the address, 12300 Kivij채rvenkatu, Kivij채rvi, I observed a non-custodial relative, Mr. Juhani Lehtonen, who has been caring for the child, 8-year-old Aino Salmi, since her parents' separation in 2022. During our conversation, Mr. Lehtonen expressed concerns about Aino's increasing anxiety and withdrawal from social activities. He reported that Aino often expresses feelings of sadness and frustration when discussing her parents' divorce.

Upon entering the residence, I observed a cluttered living room with limited access to natural light. The kitchen area was in disarray, with dirty dishes and utensils scattered about. Aino's bedroom appeared tidy but lacked personal touches or decorations. The overall condition of the home suggested a lack of organization and maintenance.

During our interaction with Aino, she seemed hesitant to engage in conversation, preferring to focus on her tablet or playing alone. Her responses were brief and lacking in enthusiasm, indicating potential emotional distress.

Assessment:
The assessment revealed a high level of stress and anxiety within the household, primarily stemming from Aino's parents' separation. Mr. Lehtonen's efforts to provide stability and support have been commendable, but his own emotional state appears strained due to the added responsibility of caring for Aino. The living conditions in the home are suboptimal, contributing to Aino's feelings of sadness and frustration.

The case severity is high due to the potential risks associated with Aino's emotional state, including increased vulnerability to bullying or social isolation at school. Furthermore, Mr. Lehtonen's own well-being may be compromised by his caregiving responsibilities, which could impact his ability to provide adequate support for Aino.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Referral to local counseling services: Arrange for Aino and Mr. Lehtonen to receive individual and joint counseling sessions to address their emotional needs and develop coping strategies.
2. Home safety assessment: Conduct a thorough home safety assessment to identify potential hazards and provide recommendations for improvement.
3. Support for Mr. Lehtonen: Offer support and resources to help Mr. Lehtonen manage his caregiving responsibilities, including respite care services or temporary financial assistance.
4. School placement: Meet with Aino's school administrators to discuss her academic needs and develop a plan to ensure her social integration and emotional well-being.

Timeline for Follow-up Visits:
- 02.16.2024: Initial counseling sessions for Aino and Mr. Lehtonen
- 03.01.2024: Home safety assessment and recommendations
- 03.15.2024: Review of progress, support for Mr. Lehtonen, and school placement

This report concludes the visit, highlighting the need for continued support and resources to ensure Aino's well-being and integration into Finnish society.
