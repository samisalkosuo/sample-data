Social Services Visit Report

Date: 05.01.2025
Location: Jyväskylä, Finland
Visit Type: Youth Mentoring Program Assessment

Summary of Visit Purpose:
This visit was conducted as part of the ongoing assessment of the youth mentoring program for a rehabilitated ex-offender reintegrating into society in Jyväskylä, Finland. The purpose of this visit was to evaluate the effectiveness of the program and identify any areas of concern that may impact the well-being and reintegration of the individual.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival at the address provided (Korvenkatu 12, 40100 Jyväskylä), I observed a calm and composed environment. The individual, Mr. Antti Laaksonen, was present during my visit and appeared to be in good spirits. He reported feeling supported by the mentoring program and credited it with helping him stay on track with his rehabilitation.

During our conversation, I noted that Mr. Laaksonen's living conditions were satisfactory, with a clean and organized home environment. However, he expressed some concerns about his social isolation and difficulty finding employment in the local job market. He also mentioned feeling frustrated with the lack of resources available to support individuals like himself who are trying to reintegrate into society.

Mr. Laaksonen's emotional state was generally positive, but I did notice a slight increase in anxiety when discussing his employment prospects. His behavior during the visit was cooperative and respectful, indicating a willingness to engage with the mentoring program and work towards his goals.

Assessment:
Based on my observations and discussions with Mr. Laaksonen, I assess the situation as moderate in terms of case severity. While there are some concerns about social isolation and employment prospects, the individual's overall demeanor and cooperation suggest that he is committed to his rehabilitation and willing to seek support when needed.

However, I do recommend further assessment and potential referrals to specialized services, such as job training programs or counseling services, to address Mr. Laaksonen's specific needs and challenges. Additionally, regular check-ins with the mentoring program staff will be necessary to monitor progress and provide ongoing support.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Referral to local job training programs: I recommend that Mr. Laaksonen be referred to a local job training program to help him develop skills and gain employment experience.
2. Counseling services: Given Mr. Laaksonen's expressed frustration with social isolation, I suggest that he receive counseling services to address any underlying emotional or psychological issues.
3. Regular check-ins with mentoring program staff: To ensure ongoing support and monitoring of progress, regular check-ins with the mentoring program staff will be necessary every 6 weeks for the next 12 months.

Timeline:

* Next visit: 06.01.2025
* Referral to job training programs: Within the next 2 weeks
* Counseling services: To be arranged through local social services within the next month
