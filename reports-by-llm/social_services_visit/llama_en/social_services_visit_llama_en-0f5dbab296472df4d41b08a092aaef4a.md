Social Services Visit Report

Date: 31 January 2025
Location: Soini, Finland
Visit Type: Immigration case monitoring visit

Summary of Visit Purpose:
This visit was conducted to monitor the well-being and integration of a youth who is aging out of the foster system in Soini, Finland. The purpose of this visit is to assess the youth's living situation, interactions with family members, and overall adjustment to their new life outside of care.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival at the address 123 Koulukatu, Soini, I met with the youth, Aino Suominen, who is 19 years old. Aino appears to be adjusting well to her new living situation, which is being provided by a local family through the foster care system. The family, consisting of two adults and one child, seems welcoming and supportive. During our conversation, Aino expressed some concerns about feeling like an outsider in her new community, but also mentioned that she is enjoying learning Finnish language classes at the local school.

The living conditions at 123 Koulukatu are satisfactory, with a comfortable and clean home environment. The family's child, who is approximately 8 years old, seems to be adjusting well to having Aino as a sibling. However, there were some concerns raised about the availability of recreational activities for Aino in the area.

Assessment:
Based on my observations during this visit, I assess the situation as low-risk. Aino appears to be adapting well to her new life and is receiving support from her foster family. The local community seems welcoming, and Aino has expressed interest in participating in extracurricular activities. However, it would be beneficial to monitor Aino's progress over the coming months to ensure that she continues to thrive.

Family dynamics appear stable, with both adults being supportive and involved in Aino's care. The child sibling is adjusting well, but may require additional support or supervision to ensure a smooth transition.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Schedule regular check-ins with Aino every 6 months to monitor her progress and adjust support services as needed.
2. Arrange for Aino to participate in extracurricular activities, such as sports or hobbies, to help her integrate into the local community.
3. Provide additional support or supervision for the child sibling if necessary, to ensure a smooth transition and prevent any potential conflicts.
