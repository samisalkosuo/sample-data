Social Services Visit Report

Date: 22 May 2025
Location: Lapua, Finland
Visit Type: Emergency Housing Verification
Case Severity: Urgent

Summary of Visit Purpose:
This emergency housing verification visit was conducted to assess the living conditions and well-being of the two-parent household in question due to reported neglect concerns. The purpose of this visit is to evaluate the immediate safety and health needs of the family, as well as identify potential risks and areas for support.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival at the address, 12300 Linnankatu, Lapua, Finland (Kokemuskatu 12), I observed a tense atmosphere within the household. The parents, Mr. and Mrs. Antti Laaksonen, were visibly distressed and appeared to be in conflict with each other. The children, aged 7 and 9, seemed anxious and withdrawn, displaying signs of emotional distress.

The living conditions were found to be substandard, with inadequate heating and poor ventilation in the main living area. The kitchen was cluttered, and there were visible signs of neglect, including uncleanliness and expired food products. The children's bedrooms were small and poorly lit, with old furniture and minimal personal belongings.

Assessment:
The assessment indicates a high level of risk to the family's physical and emotional well-being due to the reported neglect concerns. The parents' behavior and interactions during the visit suggested a lack of effective communication and conflict resolution skills, which may be contributing to the neglectful environment. The children's emotional state and behavioral changes warrant close monitoring and support.

The case severity is urgent due to the presence of clear signs of neglect, including inadequate living conditions, poor nutrition, and potential exposure to health risks. Immediate action is required to ensure the family's safety and well-being.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Emergency housing placement: The family will be offered temporary accommodation through a local emergency housing service to address immediate needs for heating, lighting, and basic amenities.
2. Family counseling: A referral to a local family counseling service has been made to support the parents in addressing their conflict resolution skills and improving their parenting practices.
3. Child protection services: The children's well-being will be closely monitored, and regular check-ins with the child protection services will be scheduled to ensure their safety and provide additional support as needed.
4. Health and nutrition assessment: A referral has been made for a health and nutrition assessment to address any potential health risks associated with the family's living conditions.

Timeline:

* 24 May 2025: Follow-up visit to assess progress in addressing neglect concerns and providing support services.
* 30 June 2025: Review of case status and potential re-evaluation of emergency housing placement.
