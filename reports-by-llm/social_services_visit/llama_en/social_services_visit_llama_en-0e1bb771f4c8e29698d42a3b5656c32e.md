Social Services Visit Report

Date: 29.10.2024
Location: Mynämäki, Finland
Visit Type: Newborn and Infant Safety Visit

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to assess the safety and well-being of a newborn infant in a household where the mother is recovering from domestic abuse. The visit aimed to identify potential risks and provide support to ensure the child's safety and the mother's recovery.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival, I met with the mother, Ms. Aino Luukkainen, at her residence on Kruununhaka 14, Mynämäki. She appeared nervous and anxious, but cooperative during the visit. The living conditions were generally clean and tidy, but there were signs of recent stress and disorganization.

During our conversation, I observed that Ms. Luukkainen was struggling to cope with her emotions and seemed overwhelmed by the responsibilities of caring for a newborn infant. She reported feeling isolated and unsupported since leaving an abusive relationship. The infant, born on 15.9.2024, was sleeping peacefully in its crib, but I noted that the room was not baby-proofed, and hazardous materials were within reach.

Ms. Luukkainen's emotional state was evident throughout our interaction. She appeared tearful at times and struggled to articulate her feelings. However, she also demonstrated resilience and determination to provide a safe environment for her child.

Assessment:
The situation is moderate in terms of risk, with potential concerns related to the mother's emotional well-being and the infant's safety. While Ms. Luukkainen has made significant progress since leaving the abusive relationship, there are still risks associated with her recovery and the care of her newborn infant.

Family dynamics were not fully explored during this visit, but it is essential to note that Ms. Luukkainen reported having limited contact with family members who may be able to provide support. The mother's partner was not present during our meeting, and I did not have an opportunity to assess their relationship or potential involvement in the child's care.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Referral to local domestic violence support services: Ms. Luukkainen will receive a referral to a local organization providing counseling, advocacy, and practical support for survivors of domestic abuse.
2. Home safety assessment: A follow-up visit will be scheduled to assess the home environment and provide guidance on baby-proofing and hazard mitigation.
3. Regular check-ins: The mother will be scheduled for regular check-ins (every 6-8 weeks) to monitor her well-being, provide emotional support, and address any concerns or issues that may arise.
4. Family contact assessment: A follow-up visit will be planned to assess the mother's relationship with family members who may be able to provide support.

Timeline:

* Next follow-up visit: 15.12.2024
* Home safety assessment: TBA (dependent on availability of social worker)
