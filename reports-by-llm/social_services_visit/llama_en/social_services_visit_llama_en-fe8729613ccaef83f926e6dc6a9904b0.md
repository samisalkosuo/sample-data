Social Services Visit Report

Date: 06.01.2025
Location: Pyhäntä, Finland
Visit Type: Youth mentoring program assessment
Case Severity: Urgent

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to assess the well-being and living conditions of 17-year-old Aino Kärkkäinen, a youth aging out of the foster system. The visit was conducted as part of the ongoing monitoring of her case, which has been classified as urgent due to concerns about her emotional stability and potential risks to herself or others.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival at Aino's residence in Pyhäntä, I observed a generally tidy living space with minimal signs of disorganization. However, upon closer inspection, I noticed some areas that required attention, such as the kitchen counters and floors, which were cluttered with dirty dishes and food packaging. Aino was initially hesitant to engage in conversation but gradually warmed up during our discussion.

During our interaction, it became clear that Aino is struggling to cope with the transition from foster care to independent living. She expressed feelings of anxiety, loneliness, and uncertainty about her future. Her emotional state appeared fragile, and she seemed overwhelmed by the responsibilities of daily life. Notable concerns included her lack of a stable income source, limited social connections, and inadequate access to mental health services.

Assessment:
The assessment revealed that Aino's living situation is precarious due to her inability to afford basic necessities like food and rent. Her emotional state is fragile, and she requires immediate support to address these challenges. The case severity has been elevated due to the potential risks of self-harm or suicidal ideation, which were confirmed during our conversation.

Family dynamics are limited, as Aino's foster family has since moved away, leaving her without a stable support network. Her biological parents are not in contact with her, and she has expressed no interest in seeking out new family connections. The absence of a supportive network exacerbates her emotional vulnerability.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
Based on the assessment, I recommend the following:

1. Immediate referral to local mental health services for crisis intervention and ongoing support.
2. Assistance with accessing basic necessities like food, rent, and utilities through social services.
3. Connection with a trusted adult mentor or peer group to provide emotional support and guidance.
4. Regular home visits to monitor Aino's living conditions and provide ongoing support.

Timeline:

* Within the next 48 hours: Arrange for emergency financial assistance and connect Aino with local mental health services.
* Within the next two weeks: Schedule regular home visits to assess Aino's progress and adjust support services as needed.
* Within the next three months: Re-evaluate case severity and adjust recommendations accordingly.
