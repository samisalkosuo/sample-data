Social Services Visit Report

Date: 10.03.2025
Location: Föglö, Finland
Visit Type: Domestic Relocation Follow-up

Summary of Visit Purpose:
This visit was conducted to follow up on the domestic relocation plan for a woman who has been recovering from domestic abuse in her previous residence. The purpose of this visit is to assess the current living situation, ensure the woman's safety and well-being, and provide support to facilitate a successful transition.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival at the new residence, located at Kustavininkatu 12, Föglö, I observed that the woman, Ms. Sofia Lindström, was visibly anxious but cooperative during our conversation. She reported feeling safe in her new home and appreciated the efforts made by social services to support her relocation.

The living conditions of the residence were satisfactory, with adequate space for personal belongings and basic amenities. However, there were some concerns regarding the cleanliness and organization of the premises, which may require additional attention from Ms. Lindström.

During our conversation, I noted that Ms. Lindström was hesitant to discuss her past experiences with domestic abuse, but she did express gratitude for the support provided by social services during this challenging period. Her emotional state appeared stable, but there were moments of vulnerability and frustration that required empathetic listening.

Assessment:
Given the high case severity, it is essential to continue monitoring Ms. Lindström's situation closely. The relocation plan appears to be in place, but ongoing support and follow-up visits are necessary to ensure her safety and well-being. The current living conditions require some improvement, but with guidance and resources, Ms. Lindström can develop the skills needed to maintain a safe and stable environment.

Family dynamics:
Ms. Lindström's children, aged 8 and 10, were present during our visit and appeared to be adjusting well to their new home. However, it is crucial to continue monitoring their emotional state and providing support as needed, as they may still be experiencing the effects of their mother's past trauma.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Ongoing Support Visits: Schedule regular visits (every 2 weeks) to monitor Ms. Lindström's progress, provide guidance, and address any concerns that arise.
2. Home Safety Assessment: Conduct a thorough home safety assessment to identify potential risks and provide recommendations for improvement.
3. Counseling Services: Arrange for continued counseling sessions to support Ms. Lindström in addressing her emotional trauma and developing coping strategies.
4. Family Support Group: Refer Ms. Lindström and her children to a family support group, which can provide a safe space for them to share their experiences and connect with others who have faced similar challenges.

Timeline:

* Next visit: 24.03.2025 (every 2 weeks)
* Home safety assessment: Scheduled for 17.04.2025
* Counseling services: Ongoing, with regular sessions scheduled every 4 weeks
