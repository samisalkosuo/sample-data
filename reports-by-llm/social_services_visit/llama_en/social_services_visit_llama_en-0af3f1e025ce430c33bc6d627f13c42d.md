Social Services Visit Report

Date: 27 May 2025
Location: Juupajoki, Finland
Visit Type: Unaccompanied Minor Intake Assessment

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct an intake assessment for an unaccompanied minor in temporary accommodation. The family's situation was identified as moderate due to concerns regarding the child's well-being and integration into Finnish society.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival, I met with Mr. Ali, the father, who expressed gratitude for our visit and concern about his daughter, Amira's (12 years old), adjustment to her new environment. The family resides in a two-bedroom apartment at address 123 Koulukatu, Juupajoki. The living conditions are modest, with basic furniture and limited storage space.

During the assessment, I observed that Amira seemed hesitant to engage in conversations, preferring to keep to herself. Her mother, Mrs. Ali, reported difficulties in managing her daughter's behavior due to language barriers and cultural differences. The family has been experiencing stress related to their refugee status and uncertainty about their future in Finland.

Notable concerns included the child's limited access to education and social activities outside of school, as well as her lack of familiarity with Finnish customs and traditions. Mr. Ali expressed his desire to support Amira's integration but felt overwhelmed by the challenges they face.

Assessment:
The family's situation is characterized by moderate case severity due to the child's emotional distress and difficulties in adapting to their new environment. The parents' language proficiency and cultural background pose additional challenges for their daughter's integration into Finnish society.

Family dynamics appear strained, with tensions arising from the parents' differing expectations and responsibilities. However, both Mr. Ali and Mrs. Ali demonstrated a strong desire to support Amira's well-being and provide her with a stable environment.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Referral to language classes for the family: To address Amira's limited Finnish language skills and facilitate her integration into school.
2. Support services for refugee families: To provide guidance on navigating the Finnish social welfare system, accessing education and healthcare services, and addressing cultural differences.
3. Regular home visits: To monitor the family's progress, offer emotional support, and provide additional resources as needed.

Timeline:

* Within the next two weeks: Arrange language classes for the family through local community organizations or government agencies.
* Within the next four weeks: Schedule regular home visits to assess the family's progress and adjust recommendations accordingly.
* Within the next six weeks: Follow up with Amira's school to ensure she is receiving adequate support and accommodations.

Next steps will be taken in consultation with relevant authorities and community organizations to provide the necessary support for this family.
