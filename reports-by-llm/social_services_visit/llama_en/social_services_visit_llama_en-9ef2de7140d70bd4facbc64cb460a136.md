Social Services Visit Report

Date: 23.03.2025
Location: Valkeakoski, Finland
Visit Type: Substance Abuse Support Visit

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to assess the situation of elderly couple, Mr. and Mrs. Taavitsainen, who are living independently in Valkeakoski. The referral indicated that they have been experiencing difficulties with substance abuse, which is affecting their daily life and well-being.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival, I observed that the couple was cooperative and open during our conversation. They reported using alcohol moderately over the past year, but admitted to having a few "bad days" where they would consume more than usual. The living conditions were clean and tidy, with no signs of neglect or abuse.

During our discussion, it became apparent that Mr. Taavitsainen had been experiencing anxiety and depression since his wife's diagnosis with dementia two years ago. He reported feeling isolated and lonely, which he believed contributed to his increased alcohol consumption. Mrs. Taavitsainen acknowledged her husband's struggles but expressed concern about the impact of his drinking on their relationship.

Notable concerns included Mr. Taavitsainen's increasing irritability and short-temperedness when sober, as well as his reported blackouts and memory lapses. Mrs. Taavitsainen also mentioned that she had noticed changes in her husband's behavior, such as becoming more withdrawn and isolated.

Assessment:
The situation appears to be moderate in severity, with both partners acknowledging the issue and expressing a desire for support. However, the presence of underlying mental health concerns, such as anxiety and depression, adds complexity to the situation. The couple's living conditions are satisfactory, but their relationship is strained due to Mr. Taavitsainen's substance abuse.

Family dynamics suggest that the couple is interdependent, with both partners relying on each other for emotional support. However, this also means that they may be more vulnerable to the negative effects of Mr. Taavitsainen's drinking.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Referral to local counseling services for couples dealing with substance abuse and mental health concerns.
2. Invitation to join a support group for individuals struggling with addiction and related mental health issues.
3. Regular home visits to monitor progress, provide emotional support, and address any emerging concerns.
4. Collaboration with the local healthcare system to ensure access to necessary medical care and treatment.

Timeline:

* Next visit: 6 weeks from today's date
* Follow-up phone call: 12 weeks from today's date
