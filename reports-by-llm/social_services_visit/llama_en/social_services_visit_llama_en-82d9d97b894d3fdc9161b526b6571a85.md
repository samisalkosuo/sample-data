Social Services Visit Report

Date: 01.03.2025
Location: Pomarkku, Finland
Visit Type: Household Financial Hardship Review

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct a review of the household financial hardship in light of the case severity, which is classified as high. The visit aimed to assess the current situation, identify potential risks, and evaluate the family dynamics.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival at the address, 12300 Kivimäki, Pomarkku, Finland (Kivimäki 12), I was greeted by the teenage mother, Aino Lehtonen, who appeared visibly stressed. The infant, born in December 2024, was sleeping in a crib while Aino's parents, Juhani and Maria Lehtonen, were engaged in conversation. During our interaction, it became apparent that the family is struggling to make ends meet.

Aino expressed concerns about the increasing pressure of caring for an infant on her own, citing difficulties in accessing affordable childcare options. Her parents, although supportive, seemed overwhelmed by their own financial constraints and the added responsibility of supporting Aino and the child. The living conditions were modest, with a small kitchen and limited storage space.

Notable concerns included:

* Limited access to basic necessities, such as food and healthcare
* High levels of stress and anxiety within the household
* Potential risks associated with inadequate childcare arrangements

Assessment:
The assessment revealed a complex situation where Aino is shouldering significant responsibilities while her parents struggle to provide adequate support. The high case severity rating is justified by the presence of multiple risk factors, including financial hardship, limited access to resources, and potential emotional distress.

Family dynamics appeared strained, with Aino's parents struggling to communicate effectively about their concerns and limitations. However, they demonstrated a willingness to work together as a family unit to address the challenges facing them.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Referral to local childcare services: Arrange for an assessment of affordable childcare options in Pomarkku, ensuring that Aino can access reliable care for her infant.
2. Financial assistance: Explore potential financial support from local social services and government agencies to alleviate some of the family's financial burdens.
3. Family counseling: Schedule a follow-up visit with the family to provide guidance on effective communication strategies and stress management techniques.
4. Home visit schedule: Arrange for regular home visits (every 6 weeks) to monitor the family's progress, provide ongoing support, and address any emerging concerns.

Timeline:

* Referral to childcare services: Within the next 2 weeks
* Financial assistance assessment: Within the next 3 weeks
* Family counseling session: Scheduled for 15.03.2025

Next steps will be taken in accordance with local social services protocols and in collaboration with relevant agencies to ensure the well-being of Aino, her infant, and her parents.
