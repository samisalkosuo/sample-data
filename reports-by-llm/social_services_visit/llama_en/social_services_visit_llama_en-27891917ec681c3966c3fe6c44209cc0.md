Social Services Visit Report

Date: 07.11.2024
Location: Alajärvi, Finland
Visit Type: Elderly care follow-up
Case Severity: Moderate

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct a follow-up assessment on the well-being of Mrs. Maria Lehtonen and her newborn infant at their residence in Alajärvi, Finland. The elderly care follow-up visit aimed to evaluate the current living conditions, assess any changes or concerns since the last visit, and provide support and guidance as needed.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, I was greeted by Mrs. Lehtonen, who appeared slightly anxious but welcoming. She reported that she had been experiencing some difficulties with sleep deprivation due to caring for her newborn infant alone. The living conditions of the residence were generally clean and tidy, although there were signs of disorganization in the kitchen area.

During our conversation, I observed that Mrs. Lehtonen seemed overwhelmed by the responsibilities of caring for a new baby on her own. She expressed concerns about accessing support services and feeling isolated from family and friends. The infant was well-cared for, but I noted that the nursery was not well-ventilated, which may pose health risks.

Assessment:
Based on my observations and assessment, it appears that Mrs. Lehtonen is facing moderate challenges in caring for herself and her newborn infant due to lack of support and social isolation. The current living conditions are generally safe, but there are concerns about the infant's health and well-being. I also noted that Mrs. Lehtonen may benefit from additional emotional support and guidance on accessing local resources.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
Based on my assessment, I recommend the following:

1. Referral to local social services for home visitation and support with childcare.
2. Connection with a local parenting group to provide emotional support and community connections.
3. Assistance in arranging for a home safety audit to address ventilation concerns in the nursery.
4. Follow-up visits every 6 weeks to monitor progress, provide ongoing support, and assess any changes in Mrs. Lehtonen's situation.

Timeline:

* Next follow-up visit: 12.11.2024
* Home visitation and support with childcare: arranged within the next 2 weeks
* Connection with local parenting group: facilitated within the next week

Conclusion:
This visit highlighted the importance of ongoing support for Mrs. Lehtonen as she navigates the challenges of caring for a newborn infant alone. I am confident that with the recommended actions, we can help alleviate some of her concerns and ensure a safe and healthy environment for both herself and her infant.
