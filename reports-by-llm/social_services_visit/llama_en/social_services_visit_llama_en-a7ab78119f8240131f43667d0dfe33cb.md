Social Services Visit Report

Visit Date: 03.07.2025
Location: Pieksämäki, Finland
Visit Type: Immigration Case Monitoring Visit

Summary of Visit Purpose:
This visit was conducted to monitor the well-being of the Kauranen family, who are currently undergoing immigration proceedings in Finland. The purpose of this visit is to assess their living conditions, interactions, and overall situation to determine if any additional support or resources are required.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival at the Kauranen residence, located at Kauppatorinkatu 12, Pieksämäki, I was greeted by Mr. and Mrs. Kauranen, along with their four children (ages 8, 10, 12, and 14). The family welcomed me warmly and provided a brief overview of their daily routines and living arrangements.

During the visit, I observed that the family is adjusting well to life in Finland, despite facing some challenges related to language barriers and cultural differences. The parents are actively seeking support from local community organizations and social services to help them navigate the immigration process.

However, I noted that the children seem to be struggling with their new school environment, particularly the 12-year-old son, who expressed feelings of loneliness and frustration during our conversation. Mrs. Kauranen mentioned that she is concerned about her children's well-being and is seeking additional support from local schools and community organizations.

Assessment:
Based on my observations and discussions with the family, I assess the situation as low-risk at this time. The Kauranens are resourceful and proactive in seeking help, and their living conditions appear to be stable. However, it is essential to continue monitoring their situation to ensure that they receive any necessary support or resources.

Family dynamics seem to be positive, with both parents actively involved in caring for their children and managing the household. The family's cultural background and language proficiency are also being supported through local community organizations and social services.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Referral to local schools: I will refer the Kauranen children to a school counselor to address their concerns about adjusting to the new school environment.
2. Language support: I will arrange for additional language classes for the family, either privately or through local community organizations, to help them improve their Finnish language skills.
3. Community organization support: I will continue to provide the Kauranens with information and referrals to local community organizations that can offer additional support, such as cultural events, social activities, and parenting groups.

Next steps:

* Schedule a follow-up visit in 6 months to assess the family's progress and adjust recommendations as needed.
* Provide the Kauranens with a list of recommended resources and services, including language classes, school counseling, and community organization support.
