Social Services Visit Report

Date: 05.07.2025
Location: Tampere, Finland
Visit Type: Mental Health Monitoring Visit

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct a mental health monitoring visit for the separated couple, Juhani Kärkkäinen and Sari Pyyhtinen, with shared custody arrangements in place. The case has been classified as urgent due to concerns regarding the well-being of both parents and their children.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival at the residence located at Kauppatori 14, Tampere, I observed a tense atmosphere within the household. Juhani and Sari displayed visible signs of stress and anxiety during our interactions. The children, aged 8 and 10, seemed to be struggling with their parents' constant arguing and lack of cohesion.

The living conditions were satisfactory, with adequate space for the family of four. However, I noted that the kitchen was in disarray, and there were signs of recent conflicts on display (e.g., broken dishes, torn curtains). The children's bedrooms showed evidence of neglect, with unmade beds and scattered toys.

During our conversation, Juhani expressed concerns about Sari's increasing isolation and lack of engagement in family activities. Sari countered that Juhani was being overly critical and dismissive of her feelings. Both parents acknowledged the need for counseling but seemed hesitant to seek professional help due to perceived stigma or financial constraints.

Assessment:
Given the urgent nature of this case, it is essential to address the escalating tensions and emotional distress within the household. The lack of cohesion and communication between Juhani and Sari poses a significant risk to the well-being of their children. Furthermore, the absence of effective coping mechanisms and support systems exacerbates the situation.

Family dynamics are complex, with both parents struggling to co-parent effectively. The children's emotional state is precarious, and it is crucial that we provide them with a stable and nurturing environment.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Referral to Family Counseling Services: I recommend that Juhani and Sari be referred to a family counseling service specializing in separation and co-parenting issues. This will enable them to address their conflicts and develop healthier communication patterns.
2. Parenting Classes: To improve co-parenting skills, I suggest enrolling both parents in parenting classes focusing on conflict resolution, emotional regulation, and child-centered approaches.
3. Support for Sari's Mental Health: Given Sari's expressed concerns about her mental health, I recommend that she be referred to a mental health professional specializing in anxiety and depression. This will provide her with the necessary support to manage her symptoms and improve overall well-being.
4. Regular Progress Monitoring: To ensure the effectiveness of these interventions, regular progress monitoring visits will be scheduled every 6 weeks for the next 12 months.
