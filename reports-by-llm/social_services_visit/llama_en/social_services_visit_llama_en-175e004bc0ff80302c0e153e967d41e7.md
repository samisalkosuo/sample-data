Social Services Visit Report

Visit Date: 16 January 2025
Location: Paltamo, Finland
Visit Type: Refugee Integration Support Visit
Case Severity: Low

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to assess the well-being and integration needs of a refugee family residing in Paltamo. The case involves a disabled adult and their live-in caregiver, who require support with daily living tasks due to the individual's disability. This visit aimed to evaluate the current situation, identify potential risks, and provide recommendations for further support.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, I was greeted by the disabled adult, Mr. Kauri Salmi, and his live-in caregiver, Ms. Maria Rodriguez. The living conditions were clean and tidy, with basic furnishings and essential appliances. However, there were signs of fatigue and stress evident in both individuals, particularly during meal times.

During our conversation, I observed that Mr. Salmi was struggling to cope with the demands of daily life due to his disability. Ms. Rodriguez demonstrated exceptional care and support, but expressed concerns about her own well-being and the impact of caregiving on her mental health. The couple's communication was respectful, but there were moments of frustration and tension.

Assessment:
Given the low case severity, the situation appears stable, with both individuals receiving basic necessities and support. However, the caregiver's emotional state and potential burnout require closer monitoring. The disabled adult's needs for assistance with daily tasks and mobility remain a concern, and it is essential to explore options for additional support services.

Family dynamics were observed to be generally positive, with mutual respect and appreciation for each other's efforts. However, there was a noticeable lack of social interaction outside the home, which may contribute to feelings of isolation and loneliness.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Referral to local disability organizations for assistance with daily living tasks and mobility support.
2. Connection with mental health services to address caregiver burnout and stress management.
3. Invitation to participate in community integration programs, such as language classes and social events, to promote social interaction and a sense of belonging.
4. Regular follow-up visits to monitor the situation and provide ongoing support.

Timeline for Further Visits:
- 30 January 2025: Follow-up visit to assess progress and adjust recommendations as needed.
- 15 February 2025: Meeting with local disability organizations to discuss potential services and support.
