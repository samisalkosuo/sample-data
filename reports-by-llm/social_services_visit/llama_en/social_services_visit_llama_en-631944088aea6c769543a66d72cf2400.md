Social Services Visit Report

Date: 11.11.2024
Location: Helsinki, Finland
Visit Type: Child Visitation Supervision Report

Summary of Visit Purpose:
This visit was conducted as part of an ongoing child visitation supervision report to assess the well-being and safety of the child in a transitional housing setting post-rehabilitation. The purpose of this visit is to evaluate the household's ability to provide a stable and nurturing environment for the child, ensuring their physical, emotional, and psychological needs are met.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival at the address 123 Mikonkatu, Helsinki, Finland (residence of Ms. Maria Rodriguez), I observed a calm and peaceful atmosphere within the transitional housing unit. The child, Aino, aged 7, was present during the visit and appeared to be in good spirits. Her parents, Mr. and Mrs. Rodriguez, were also present and engaged in conversation with me.

The living conditions of the residence were satisfactory, with adequate space for the family and basic amenities provided. However, there were some minor concerns regarding cleanliness and organization, which may require attention from the household to maintain a healthy environment.

During our interaction, Aino displayed enthusiasm and affection towards her parents, indicating a strong bond within the family unit. The parents demonstrated patience, understanding, and effective communication skills when interacting with their child, suggesting a positive approach to parenting.

Assessment:
Given the low case severity, it is evident that the household has made significant progress in addressing their challenges since the initial assessment. The presence of a stable and supportive environment, coupled with the parents' ability to provide care and guidance, suggests a promising trajectory for Aino's well-being.

However, it is essential to continue monitoring the situation to ensure that any emerging issues are addressed promptly. Regular follow-up visits will be necessary to assess the household's ongoing progress and provide support as needed.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Schedule bi-weekly home visits to monitor the household's continued progress and address any concerns that may arise.
2. Refer Ms. Rodriguez to a local parenting support group, which can provide additional guidance and resources for managing challenges related to child-rearing.
3. Arrange for Aino to participate in regular school-based activities and extracurricular programs to foster her socialization and development.

Timeline:

* Bi-weekly home visits will commence on 18.11.2024 and continue until further notice.
* Follow-up assessment with Ms. Rodriguez regarding parenting support group participation is scheduled for 25.11.2024.
