Social Services Visit Report

Date: 26 June 2025

Location: Perho, Finland

Visit Type: Safety Plan Monitoring Visit

Case Information:
Client Name: Leena Kauriala
Address: Koulukatu 12, 45600 Lempäälä, Finland
Household Composition: Child (L.) living with non-custodial relative, Mr. Juhani Kauriala

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to monitor the safety plan in place for Leena's child, L., who is currently living with her non-custodial father, Mr. Juhani Kauriala, in Perho, Finland. The visit aimed to assess the current situation, risks, and family dynamics, given the high case severity.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, I observed that Leena had scheduled a meeting with me at her workplace, which was convenient for both parties. Mr. Juhani Kauriala greeted me warmly and provided an overview of their living arrangements. The child, L., seemed hesitant to engage in conversation but appeared generally well-nourished and clean.

During the discussion, I noted that Leena expressed concerns about Mr. Juhani's substance abuse issues and how they affect their daily life. She reported that he often leaves for extended periods without notice, leaving her to manage the household alone. The child also mentioned feeling anxious when Mr. Juhani is absent, as she worries about his well-being.

I observed some signs of neglect, such as dirty dishes piling up in the kitchen and a general lack of organization in the living space. However, I did not witness any overt physical or emotional abuse during my visit.

Assessment:
Given the high case severity, it is clear that Leena's situation requires close monitoring to ensure the child's safety and well-being. The risks associated with Mr. Juhani's substance abuse issues are significant, and his unpredictable behavior poses a threat to the child's emotional stability.

The family dynamics appear strained, with Leena shouldering most of the responsibilities while Mr. Juhani is away. This imbalance can lead to feelings of resentment and frustration among all household members. It is essential to address these underlying tensions to prevent further escalation.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Referral to local substance abuse treatment services for Mr. Juhani Kauriala.
2. Collaboration with the Finnish Social Security Institution (Kela) to explore possible financial assistance for Leena, considering her limited income and increased expenses due to Mr. Juhani's absence.
3. Regular home visits to monitor the living conditions and provide support to Leena in managing the household.
4. Scheduling a follow-up visit within two weeks to reassess the situation and adjust the safety plan as necessary.

Timeline for Further Visits:
- 10 July 2025: Follow-up visit to assess the implementation of the recommended actions
- 24 July 2025: Review of Mr. Juhani's treatment progress and potential adjustments to the safety plan
