Social Services Visit Report

Date: 15.10.2024
Location: Riihimäki, Finland
Visit Type: Domestic Violence Risk Assessment

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct a domestic violence risk assessment for a woman who has recently recovered from abuse in her relationship. The visit aimed to assess the current living situation and identify potential risks or concerns that may require further support.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival, the woman, Ms. Leena Kärkkäinen, welcomed me into her home at 23 Kruununhaka Street, Riihimäki. She appeared nervous but cooperative during our conversation. The living room and kitchen were tidy, with minimal signs of recent conflict or violence. However, I observed some emotional scars on Ms. Kärkkäinen's face and neck, which she attributed to the abuse.

Ms. Kärkkäinen reported that her partner had recently left the household, and she was currently receiving support from a local women's shelter. She expressed concerns about her safety and well-being, particularly regarding potential retaliation by her ex-partner. I noted that she seemed hesitant to discuss specific details of the abuse, but provided some general information about the controlling behavior and emotional manipulation.

During our conversation, Ms. Kärkkäinen displayed signs of anxiety and hypervigilance, frequently glancing over her shoulder as if expecting someone to enter the room. She also mentioned that she had been experiencing sleep disturbances and flashbacks related to the abuse.

Assessment:
Based on my observations and Ms. Kärkkäinen's accounts, I assess the situation as moderate in terms of risk. While there are concerns about potential retaliation by her ex-partner, Ms. Kärkkäinen appears to be taking steps to rebuild her life and seek support. However, it is essential to continue monitoring her situation and providing ongoing support to ensure her safety and well-being.

Family dynamics:
Ms. Kärkkäinen's relationship with her children, aged 7 and 9, seemed strained due to the recent separation from their father. She reported that they were struggling to adjust to the new living arrangements and were experiencing emotional difficulties. I recommended that we explore options for family counseling or therapy to support the children during this challenging time.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Ongoing support: Continue to provide Ms. Kärkkäinen with regular check-ins, support groups, and counseling services to address her emotional trauma and rebuild her life.
2. Safety planning: Develop a comprehensive safety plan with Ms. Kärkkäinen, including emergency contact numbers, safe housing options, and strategies for managing potential retaliation by her ex-partner.
3. Family counseling: Arrange for family counseling sessions to support the children's adjustment to their new living arrangements and address any emotional difficulties they may be experiencing.
4. Referral to local resources: Provide Ms. Kärkkäinen with information about local resources, such as the Riihimäki Women's Shelter, that can offer additional support and assistance.

Timeline for further visits:
I recommend scheduling follow-up visits every 6-8 weeks to monitor Ms. Kärkkäinen's progress, provide ongoing support, and adjust our intervention strategies as needed.
