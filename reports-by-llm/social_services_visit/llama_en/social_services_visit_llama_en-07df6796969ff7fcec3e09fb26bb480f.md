Social Services Visit Report

Date: 05.10.2024
Location: Rauma, Finland
Visit Type: Substance Abuse Support Visit

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to assess the well-being of the family unit in light of recent custody changes and substance abuse concerns. The blended family, consisting of [Client Name] (mother), [Father's Name] (father), and their children, has been experiencing difficulties due to [Client Name]'s struggles with addiction.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, I observed a tense atmosphere within the household, with [Client Name] appearing anxious and on edge. The father reported that [Client Name] had been absent from family gatherings for extended periods, citing work commitments as an excuse. However, he seemed uncertain about her whereabouts during these times. The children (ages 10 and 12) appeared withdrawn and preoccupied, displaying signs of stress and anxiety.

During the conversation, I noted that the household's living conditions were satisfactory, with basic necessities met. However, there was a noticeable lack of emotional support and open communication among family members. [Client Name] seemed hesitant to discuss her substance abuse struggles, citing shame and fear of judgment as barriers to seeking help.

Assessment:
Given the moderate case severity, I observed a complex web of relationships and dynamics within the household. The recent custody changes have likely exacerbated tensions and created uncertainty for all parties involved. [Client Name]'s substance abuse issues pose a significant risk to her own well-being, as well as that of her children, who may be exposed to negative influences or behaviors.

Family dynamics appear strained, with a lack of trust and open communication contributing to the tension. The father's attempts to provide emotional support are commendable, but his uncertainty about [Client Name]'s whereabouts suggests a need for increased transparency and accountability.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Referral to local substance abuse treatment services: I recommend that [Client Name] be connected with a specialized treatment program in Rauma, which can address her addiction issues and provide support for her recovery.
2. Family counseling sessions: Regular family therapy sessions will help the family members communicate more effectively, build trust, and develop coping strategies for managing stress and anxiety.
3. Increased parental involvement: The father's active participation in family life is crucial; I suggest he attend regular parenting classes to enhance his skills and confidence in supporting [Client Name] and their children.
4. Regular check-ins: To monitor progress and provide ongoing support, I recommend bi-weekly visits to the household for a minimum of six months.

Timeline:
- Week 1-2: Establish contact with local treatment services and schedule an initial appointment for [Client Name].
- Week 3-6: Begin family counseling sessions (twice monthly).
- Week 7-12: Schedule regular check-ins (bi-weekly) to monitor progress and provide ongoing support.

By implementing these recommendations, I am confident that the family unit can begin to heal and rebuild their relationships, ultimately improving the overall well-being of all members.
