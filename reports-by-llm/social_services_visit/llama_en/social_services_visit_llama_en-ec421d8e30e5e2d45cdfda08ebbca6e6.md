Date: 09.04.2025
Location: Tervo, Finland
Visit Type: Refugee Integration Support Visit

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to assess the well-being and integration needs of a single adult with intellectual disability residing in Tervo, Finland. The individual, Mr. Juhani Kärkkäinen, has been referred to our services due to concerns about his living conditions and ability to integrate into Finnish society.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival at Mr. Kärkkäinen's residence, I observed a cluttered and disorganized living space, with limited access to natural light and ventilation. The individual was seated in a corner of the room, surrounded by personal belongings and electronic devices. He appeared anxious and agitated, fidgeting with his hands and avoiding eye contact.

During our conversation, Mr. Kärkkäinen expressed difficulties with communication, using a combination of Finnish and his native language. He reported feeling isolated and struggling to connect with local community members due to language barriers. His emotional state was characterized by frustration and sadness, which he attributed to the challenges of adapting to a new country.

Notable concerns included Mr. Kärkkäinen's limited access to healthcare services, as well as his reliance on online resources for information and social interaction. He also reported experiencing bullying at school due to his disability and language differences.

Assessment:
The assessment revealed a high level of vulnerability in Mr. Kärkkäinen's situation, with significant risks to his physical and emotional well-being. The individual's intellectual disability, combined with language barriers and limited access to support services, has resulted in feelings of isolation and disconnection from the community.

Family dynamics were not observed during this visit, as Mr. Kärkkäinen is a single adult. However, it is essential to note that family members or caregivers may be involved in his care and should be considered in future assessments.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
Based on this assessment, I recommend the following:

1. Referral to local healthcare services for evaluation and support.
2. Language classes or cultural orientation programs to enhance Mr. Kärkkäinen's integration into Finnish society.
3. Regular home visits to monitor living conditions and provide emotional support.
4. Connection with local community organizations and social groups to facilitate social interaction and friendships.

Timeline:

* Within the next two weeks, I will schedule a follow-up visit to assess progress and adjust recommendations as needed.
* A referral to local healthcare services will be made within the next week to ensure Mr. Kärkkäinen receives necessary support for his physical and emotional well-being.

Conclusion:
This visit highlighted the need for comprehensive support services to address the complex needs of Mr. Juhani Kärkkäinen, a single adult with intellectual disability residing in Tervo, Finland. By providing targeted interventions and referrals, we can work towards enhancing his integration into Finnish society and improving his overall well-being.
