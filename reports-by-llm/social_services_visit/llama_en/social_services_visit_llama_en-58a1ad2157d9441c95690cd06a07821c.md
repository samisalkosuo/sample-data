Social Services Visit Report

Date: 23 August 2024
Location: Karstula, Finland
Visit Type: Unaccompanied Minor Intake Assessment

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct an intake assessment for an unaccompanied minor, Ms. Sofia Jensen, who recently relocated to Karstula with her immigrant family. The visit aimed to assess the well-being and safety of the child, as well as identify potential risks and areas of concern.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival at the residence located at Kruununhaka 12, 45500 Karstula, Finland, I was greeted by Sofia's mother, Ms. Maria Jensen. The family welcomed me warmly, but appeared slightly anxious about the visit. The living conditions were satisfactory, with clean and well-maintained furniture, although some areas of the apartment could benefit from additional cleaning.

Sofia, a 12-year-old girl, seemed hesitant to engage in conversation at first, but gradually warmed up as our interaction progressed. She reported feeling a bit lonely since her relocation and missing her friends from her previous school. Her mother assured me that Sofia is adjusting well academically and has made new friends at her current school.

Notable concerns included the family's limited access to Finnish language resources and cultural support services, which may exacerbate Sofia's feelings of isolation. Additionally, the parents' lack of familiarity with local healthcare services and emergency procedures raised some concerns about their ability to provide adequate care for Sofia in case of an emergency.

Assessment:
Based on my observations and discussions during the visit, I assessed the situation as low-risk, but with potential areas of concern that require ongoing support. The family's cultural background and language barriers may impact their ability to navigate Finnish social services and institutions. However, with proper guidance and resources, I am confident that they can provide a safe and supportive environment for Sofia.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Referral to local language classes and cultural orientation programs to help the family integrate into Finnish society.
2. Connection with local healthcare services to ensure the family is aware of emergency procedures and has access to necessary medical care.
3. Regular check-ins with Sofia to monitor her adjustment to the new school and provide emotional support as needed.
4. Follow-up visit in six weeks to assess the family's progress and adjust recommendations accordingly.

Timeline for Further Visits:
The next follow-up visit is scheduled for 20 October 2024, at which time I will review the family's progress and make any necessary adjustments to their support plan.
