Social Services Visit Report

Date: 03.05.2025
Location: Pietarsaari, Finland
Visit Type: Child Welfare Check

Summary of Visit Purpose:
This visit was conducted as part of an ongoing child welfare check for a single mother with three children residing in Pietarsaari, Finland. The case severity is high due to concerns about the family's living conditions and the mother's ability to provide adequate care and support for her children.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival at the residence, I observed that the home was cluttered and disorganized, with visible signs of neglect. The single mother, Ms. Aino Luukkainen, appeared visibly stressed and overwhelmed, struggling to manage the daily needs of her three children. The children, aged 6, 8, and 10, seemed anxious and fidgety, displaying signs of emotional distress.

During our conversation, Ms. Luukkainen reported difficulties in accessing basic necessities such as food and healthcare due to financial constraints. She also mentioned experiencing domestic violence from her partner, which has led to increased stress and anxiety within the household. The children's behavior and emotional state suggested that they were struggling to cope with their mother's situation.

Assessment:
The assessment indicates a high risk of child neglect and potential long-term harm to the children due to the family's unstable living conditions and the mother's limited resources. The presence of domestic violence further exacerbates the situation, posing a significant threat to the children's physical and emotional well-being.

Family dynamics appear strained, with Ms. Luukkainen struggling to maintain control and provide stability for her children. The children seem to be taking on more responsibilities than usual, indicating a need for additional support and guidance.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Immediate Referral: Ms. Luukkainen will be referred to the Pietarsaari Social Services Office for ongoing support and assistance with accessing basic necessities.
2. Domestic Violence Intervention: A referral will be made to the local domestic violence support service, Saunavaara, to provide Ms. Luukkainen with safe housing options and counseling services.
3. Child Support Services: The children will be referred to the Pietarsaari Child Support Service for assistance with accessing necessary resources, such as food, clothing, and healthcare.
4. Home Visits: Regular home visits will be scheduled to monitor the family's living conditions and provide ongoing support and guidance.

Timeline:

* Within 48 hours: Ms. Luukkainen will receive a follow-up visit from the social services office to assess her progress and provide additional support.
* Within 2 weeks: A referral will be made to the Saunavaara domestic violence support service for Ms. Luukkainen's immediate assistance.
