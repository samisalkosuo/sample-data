Social Services Visit Report

Date: 20.09.2024
Location: Savitaipale, Finland
Visit Type: Elderly care follow-up
Household Composition: Single adult with intellectual disability
Case Severity: High

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct a follow-up assessment on the well-being and living conditions of single adult, Aino Luukkainen, who resides in Savitaipale, Finland. As per our previous visits, Aino's case severity is high due to her intellectual disability and requires ongoing support.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, I observed that Aino was in a calm state, but seemed slightly anxious when interacting with me. She greeted me warmly and engaged in conversation about her daily activities, including her favorite hobbies and TV shows. Her living conditions were satisfactory, with clean and organized surroundings. However, there were some concerns regarding her nutrition and hydration. Aino reported that she often forgets to eat meals on time, which has led to weight gain.

During our interaction, I noticed that Aino's caregiver, Ms. Maria, was present but seemed overwhelmed by the demands of caring for Aino alone. She expressed difficulties in managing Aino's medication schedule and providing adequate support during daily activities.

Assessment:
The assessment revealed a high level of dependence on caregivers, with limited autonomy and decision-making capacity. Aino's intellectual disability has resulted in significant cognitive and adaptive impairments, making it challenging for her to manage daily tasks independently. The lack of social interaction and stimulation may contribute to her anxiety and agitation.

Furthermore, the caregiver's burnout and stress levels are a concern, as they may impact their ability to provide adequate care and support. The household dynamics suggest a need for additional support and respite services to alleviate caregiver burden.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
Based on the assessment, I recommend the following:

1. Referral to a nutritionist to develop a personalized meal plan that addresses Aino's nutritional needs.
2. Collaboration with the local healthcare provider to optimize Aino's medication schedule and provide additional support for her caregivers.
3. Arrangement of respite services to alleviate caregiver burden and provide Aino with regular social interaction and stimulation.
4. Regular follow-up visits every 6 weeks to monitor Aino's progress, adjust the care plan as needed, and address any emerging concerns.

Timeline:

* Within the next two weeks: Referral to a nutritionist and collaboration with the local healthcare provider to optimize medication schedule.
* Within the next four weeks: Arrangement of respite services and scheduling regular follow-up visits every 6 weeks.

Next Steps:
I will provide Aino's caregiver, Ms. Maria, with information on available resources and support services, including respite care and adult day programs. I will also schedule a meeting with the local healthcare provider to discuss Aino's care plan and develop a comprehensive strategy for her ongoing support.
