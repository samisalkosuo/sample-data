Social Services Visit Report

Date: 30 January 2025
Location: Kouvola, Finland
Visit Type: Parental Capacity Evaluation

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct a parental capacity evaluation for the elderly man living with his adult daughter in Kouvola, Finland. The referral was made due to concerns about the man's ability to care for himself and ensure the well-being of his daughter.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival, we observed that the household is small and cozy, with a warm atmosphere. The elderly man, Mr. Taavitsainen, greeted us warmly and invited us to sit down. His adult daughter, Ms. Leena, was present during the visit but seemed somewhat distant and preoccupied.

During our conversation, it became clear that Mr. Taavitsainen is struggling with mobility issues due to his age-related health problems. He requires assistance with daily tasks such as bathing, dressing, and cooking. Despite these challenges, he remains positive and determined to maintain his independence.

Ms. Leena appeared to be taking on a significant caregiving role, managing the household chores, cooking, and ensuring her father's medical needs are met. However, she seemed overwhelmed at times and expressed frustration with the lack of support services available for elderly individuals in their community.

Assessment:
Based on our observations, it appears that Mr. Taavitsainen is capable of caring for himself to a certain extent but requires assistance with daily tasks. Ms. Leena's efforts to care for her father are commendable, but she may benefit from additional support and respite services to alleviate her burden.

The household dynamics seem harmonious, with both family members showing respect and affection towards each other. However, there were moments of tension when discussing the lack of support services available in their community.

Case Severity:
Given the low severity of this case, it is unlikely that immediate intervention is required. However, regular follow-up visits will be necessary to monitor the situation and provide ongoing support to both Mr. Taavitsainen and Ms. Leena.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Schedule a follow-up visit in 6 months to assess the household's dynamics and provide additional support as needed.
2. Refer Ms. Leena to local support services for caregivers, such as respite care and counseling, to help her manage her caregiving responsibilities.
3. Explore options for home care services or adult day care programs to provide Mr. Taavitsainen with social interaction and stimulation.
