Social Services Visit Report

Date: 11 February 2025
Location: Veteli, Finland
Case Number: VET-001

Summary of Visit Purpose:
This visit was conducted as a review meeting for the support plan of single father, Juhani Kärkkäinen, and his child, Aino (8 years old). The purpose of this visit was to assess the current situation, evaluate the effectiveness of the implemented measures, and identify any areas requiring further support or intervention.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival at the residence, located at Kaarina Street 12, Veteli, Finland, I observed a generally tidy living environment. Juhani Kärkkäinen, the single father, greeted me warmly and provided an overview of their current situation. He reported that Aino has been doing well in school and has shown improvement in her behavior since the implementation of the support plan.

During our conversation, I noted that Juhani Kärkkäinen seemed to be managing his daily responsibilities effectively, but expressed concerns about maintaining a stable income due to recent job losses. He also mentioned that Aino's emotional well-being had been affected by the loss of her mother, and that he was struggling to provide adequate support.

Notable concerns included Juhani Kärkkäinen's limited access to social services and his reliance on online resources for information and guidance. Additionally, I observed that Aino seemed hesitant to discuss her feelings about her mother's passing, indicating a need for further emotional support.

Assessment:
Based on the observations during this visit, it is clear that Juhani Kärkkäinen and Aino are facing moderate challenges in their daily lives. The implemented measures have shown some positive results, but there is still a need for ongoing support to address the emotional and financial aspects of their situation.

The assessment also highlights the importance of providing Juhani Kärkkäinen with access to social services and resources that can help him navigate his current circumstances. Furthermore, it is essential to continue supporting Aino's emotional well-being through targeted interventions and counseling.
