Social Services Visit Report

Date: 03.10.2024
Location: Puumala, Finland
Visit Type: Foster family evaluation

Summary of Visit Purpose:
This visit was conducted to evaluate the foster family's living situation in light of a reported neglect case. The two-parent household has been under our supervision due to concerns about their ability to provide a safe and nurturing environment for their children.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival, I observed that the family was cooperative and welcoming. The parents, Antti and Leena, provided me with information about their daily routines, including meal times, homework assistance, and bedtime schedules. They also shared concerns about their child's behavior, stating that they have noticed an increase in tantrums and aggression towards siblings.

During the home visit, I noted that the living conditions were generally clean and tidy, but there were some areas of concern. The backyard was overgrown with weeds, and the fence surrounding the property appeared to be in need of repair. Additionally, I observed that the children's bedrooms were not well-organized, with toys and clothes scattered about.

The family reported that they have been struggling financially due to job losses and reduced hours at work. They expressed concerns about their ability to provide for their children's basic needs, including food and clothing. However, they also mentioned that they are receiving support from local social services and are working towards finding new employment opportunities.

Assessment:
Based on the observations during the visit, I assess the situation as moderate in terms of case severity. While there are some concerns about living conditions and financial stability, the family's cooperation and willingness to address these issues suggest a positive trajectory. However, it is essential to continue monitoring their progress and providing support to ensure the children's well-being.

Notable Concerns:

* The family's ability to provide for their children's basic needs, including food and clothing
* The living conditions in the backyard and fence surrounding the property
* The children's behavior and aggression towards siblings

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Schedule a follow-up visit within six weeks to assess the family's progress in addressing the concerns mentioned above.
2. Refer the family to local financial assistance programs to support their job search efforts.
3. Provide guidance on improving living conditions, including suggestions for yard maintenance and fence repair.
4. Offer counseling services to address any underlying issues contributing to the children's behavior.

Timeline:
