Social Services Visit Report

Date: 28 May 2025
Location: Kemi, Finland
Visit Type: Post-abuse recovery support visit

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to assess the well-being of the family following a reported neglect case in a two-parent household. The social services team aimed to evaluate the current living conditions, interactions within the family, and provide support for post-abuse recovery.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival at the address, 12300 Kemi, Finland (Korvenkyl√§nkatu 15), I was greeted by both parents, Juhani and Sari. They appeared anxious but cooperative during the initial conversation. The living conditions were satisfactory, with a clean and organized home environment. However, there were signs of recent stress, such as unopened mail and unwashed dishes.

During our interaction, Juhani and Sari expressed gratitude for the support services provided by social services. They reported that they had been attending counseling sessions together to address their feelings about the neglect case. The children, aged 8 and 10, seemed comfortable with their parents' presence and participated in a family game night during the visit.

Notable concerns included Juhani's occasional outbursts of anger, which Sari attributed to his stress from work. However, these incidents were not severe enough to pose an immediate risk to the children or themselves. The family reported that they had been following the recommended self-care activities and attending support groups for families affected by neglect.

Assessment:
Given the low severity of the case, it appears that Juhani and Sari are making efforts to address their feelings and provide a stable environment for their children. However, ongoing support is necessary to ensure that the family can continue to manage stress and maintain healthy relationships.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Schedule bi-weekly check-ins with Juhani and Sari to monitor their progress and provide additional support as needed.
2. Arrange for continued counseling sessions to address any emerging issues and promote long-term healing.
3. Refer the family to a local parenting class, focusing on healthy communication and conflict resolution techniques.
4. Maintain regular contact with the children's school to ensure they are receiving adequate support and monitoring their well-being.

Timeline:

* Bi-weekly check-ins: 10 June 2025
* Follow-up counseling sessions: 15 June 2025
* Parenting class enrollment: 17 June 2025

This report concludes that Juhani and Sari are making progress in their recovery, but ongoing support is necessary to ensure the family's continued well-being.
