Social Services Visit Report

Date: 08.03.2025
Location: Kolari, Finland
Visit Type: Child Welfare Check
Case Severity: Low

Summary of Visit Purpose:
This visit was conducted as part of an ongoing child welfare check to assess the well-being and safety of the elderly man living with his adult daughter in Kolari, Finland. The purpose of this visit was to evaluate the household's living conditions, interactions, and overall dynamics to determine if any concerns or risks require further intervention.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival at the address, 12300 Kemi√∂nkatu, Kolari, I observed that the elderly man, Mr. Taavetti Lehtonen, was receiving care from his adult daughter, Ms. Sofia Lehtonen. The living room and kitchen were clean and well-maintained, with no signs of neglect or abuse. However, the home's heating system was not functioning properly, and the temperature inside the house was slightly below the recommended level.

During our conversation, Mr. Lehtonen reported feeling generally healthy but experiencing some difficulties with mobility due to his age-related health issues. Ms. Sofia Lehtonen expressed concern about her father's well-being and stated that she is doing her best to provide care and support. She also mentioned that she has been struggling financially and is in need of assistance with household expenses.

Notable concerns during the visit included Mr. Lehtonen's limited mobility, which may increase his risk of falls or injuries, and Ms. Sofia Lehtonen's financial struggles, which could impact her ability to provide adequate care for her father.

Assessment:
Based on our observations and discussions, it appears that the household is generally stable, with no immediate concerns regarding neglect or abuse. However, the elderly man's mobility issues and his daughter's financial struggles do warrant further attention. The low case severity of this visit indicates that the situation is manageable, but ongoing support and monitoring are necessary to ensure the well-being of Mr. Lehtonen.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Arrange for a home visit from the local social services department within the next two weeks to assess Mr. Lehtonen's mobility and provide additional support.
2. Refer Ms. Sofia Lehtonen to local financial assistance programs to help with household expenses.
3. Schedule a follow-up visit in six months to evaluate the household's progress and adjust recommendations as needed.

Timeline for Further Visits:
- 02.06.2025: Follow-up visit to assess Mr. Lehtonen's mobility and provide additional support
- 08.06.2026: Next scheduled visit to evaluate the household's progress
