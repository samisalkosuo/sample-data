Social Services Visit Report

Date: 17 August 2024

Location: Muonio, Finland

Visit Type: Disability Support Assessment

Case Reference Number: MS-001234

Client Information:

* Name: Leevi Kauriala
* Address: Päästöntie 12, 99800 Muonio, Finland

Summary of Visit Purpose:
This visit was conducted to assess the needs of Leevi Kauriala, a transitional housing resident post-rehabilitation, in light of his moderate disability severity. The purpose of this assessment is to evaluate Leevi's living conditions, behaviors, and emotional state to determine the level of support required.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, I observed Leevi engaging in leisure activities, such as reading and watching TV, in a quiet corner of the transitional housing unit. He was accompanied by his caregiver, Ms. Maria, who provided assistance with daily tasks. The living conditions were generally clean and tidy, but there were signs of clutter and disorganization in some areas.

During our conversation, Leevi reported feeling anxious about returning to work after his rehabilitation program. He expressed concerns about his ability to perform tasks independently and required support from Ms. Maria during the visit. Leevi also mentioned that he was struggling with sleep patterns and experienced frequent nightmares.

Notable Concerns:
Leevi's emotional state appeared to be fragile, and he became tearful when discussing his return to work. His anxiety levels were elevated, and it was clear that he required additional support to manage these feelings.

Assessment:
Based on the observations during the visit, Leevi's case severity is confirmed as moderate. The transitional housing unit provides a safe and supportive environment, but Leevi requires ongoing support to address his disability-related needs. His anxiety levels and sleep patterns are significant concerns that require attention from healthcare professionals.

Family Dynamics:
Ms. Maria has been providing care and support for Leevi since his rehabilitation program ended. While she is an essential part of his daily life, it is clear that Leevi requires additional support to manage his disability independently.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Referral to Occupational Therapy: Leevi would benefit from occupational therapy sessions to develop strategies for managing anxiety and improving sleep patterns.
2. Employment Support Services: Leevi will require ongoing support to find employment that suits his abilities and provides a sense of purpose.
3. Home Care Services: Regular home care visits will be necessary to ensure Leevi's daily needs are met, including assistance with personal care and household tasks.
4. Follow-up Visits: Scheduled follow-up visits will be conducted every 6 weeks to monitor Leevi's progress and adjust support services as needed.

Timeline for Further Visits:

* Next visit: 24 August 2024
* Follow-up visits: Every 6 weeks until further notice
