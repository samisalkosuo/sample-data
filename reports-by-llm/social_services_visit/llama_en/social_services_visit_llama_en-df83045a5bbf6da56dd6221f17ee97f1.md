Social Services Visit Report

Date: 29 November 2024
Location: Ylitornio, Finland
Visit Type: Routine family wellbeing visit
Case Severity: Low

Summary of Visit Purpose:
This routine family wellbeing visit was conducted to assess the living conditions and overall wellbeing of a young adult resident in Ylitornio. The purpose of the visit was to provide support and guidance to ensure the individual's safety and happiness.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival, I met with 22-year-old Emma Lappi at her residence located at Koulukatu 12, 96100 Ylitornio. Emma greeted me warmly and invited me in. The living conditions were clean and tidy, with minimal clutter. Emma reported that she had been enjoying her solo life, focusing on her studies and hobbies.

During our conversation, I observed Emma to be in a positive emotional state, expressing enthusiasm for her interests and goals. She seemed confident and self-sufficient, taking care of her daily needs without assistance. However, I noted that Emma occasionally expressed feelings of loneliness during the evenings, which she attributed to her busy schedule.

Emma reported having regular contact with family members, including her parents, who live in a nearby town. She also mentioned using social media and online platforms to stay connected with friends. Overall, the interactions I observed suggested a stable and supportive network of relationships.

Assessment:
Based on my observations and Emma's self-reported information, I assessed that the situation is low-risk. Emma appears to be managing her daily life effectively, taking care of her physical and emotional needs. The living conditions are satisfactory, and she has a reliable support system in place.

However, I noted that occasional feelings of loneliness may require attention and support. It would be beneficial for Emma to explore ways to maintain social connections outside of online platforms, such as joining local clubs or groups aligned with her interests.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Schedule a follow-up visit within 6 months to assess Emma's continued wellbeing and provide ongoing support.
2. Encourage Emma to explore local community resources, such as clubs or organizations that align with her interests, to help maintain social connections.
3. Offer guidance on developing strategies to manage feelings of loneliness, such as regular phone calls or video chats with family members.

No referrals were necessary at this time, as the situation is deemed low-risk. However, I will continue to monitor Emma's situation and provide support as needed.
