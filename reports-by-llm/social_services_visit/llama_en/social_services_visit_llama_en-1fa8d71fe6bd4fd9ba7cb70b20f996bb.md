Social Services Visit Report

Date: 27 June 2025
Location: Iisalmi, Finland
Visit Type: Elderly care follow-up
Household Composition: Grandparents caring for grandchildren
Case Severity: Urgent

Summary of Visit Purpose:
This visit was conducted to assess the well-being and living conditions of the elderly couple, Mr. and Mrs. Taavitsainen, who are caring for their two grandchildren (ages 6 and 8) in Iisalmi, Finland. The purpose of this follow-up visit is to evaluate the current situation and provide support to ensure the family's safety and well-being.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, we observed that Mr. Taavitsainen was struggling with his mobility due to a recent fall, which has left him with a noticeable limp. Mrs. Taavitsainen appeared concerned about her husband's condition and the added responsibility of caring for their grandchildren. The children were seen playing in the living room, but they seemed subdued and restless.

During our conversation, it became clear that the family is facing significant challenges due to Mr. Taavitsainen's declining health. Mrs. Taavitsainen expressed feelings of isolation and frustration, stating that she feels overwhelmed by the caregiving responsibilities. The children were also open about their struggles in school, citing difficulties with social interactions and academic demands.

Assessment:
The assessment reveals a high-risk situation due to Mr. Taavitsainen's mobility issues and Mrs. Taavitsainen's emotional state. The family's isolation and lack of support networks are exacerbating the situation. The children's well-being is also at risk due to their struggles in school and social interactions.

Family dynamics appear strained, with tensions rising between the grandparents and grandchildren. The grandparents' own health issues and caregiving responsibilities are taking a toll on their mental and physical well-being. It is essential to address these concerns promptly to prevent further deterioration of the family's situation.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Immediate Referral: Arrange for home care services to assist with Mr. Taavitsainen's daily needs, including mobility support and medication management.
2. Counseling Services: Refer Mrs. Taavitsainen to counseling sessions to address her feelings of isolation and frustration.
3. Support Groups: Organize a support group for the family, focusing on caregiving, mental health, and social connections.
4. Educational Resources: Provide educational materials and workshops on child development, social skills, and academic support to help the children cope with their challenges.
5. Regular Follow-up Visits: Schedule bi-weekly visits to monitor the family's progress, provide ongoing support, and address any emerging concerns.
