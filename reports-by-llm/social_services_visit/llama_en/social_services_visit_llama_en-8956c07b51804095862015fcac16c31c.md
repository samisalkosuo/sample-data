Social Services Visit Report

Date: 20 May 2025
Location: Hyrynsalmi, Finland
Visit Type: Household Financial Hardship Review

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct a review of the financial hardship faced by the family residing at the address provided. The case severity is high, indicating a significant level of distress and vulnerability among the household members.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival, I met with Mr. and Mrs. Kauriala, accompanied by their four children (ages 8, 10, 12, and 14). The family was visibly stressed, with signs of fatigue and anxiety evident in their demeanor. The living conditions were modest, with some clutter and disorganization apparent.

During the conversation, it became clear that the family has been struggling to make ends meet due to reduced income and increased expenses. Mr. Kauriala reported difficulties in finding employment, while Mrs. Kauriala has had to take on additional work to support the household. The children's behavior was subdued, with some displaying signs of anxiety and stress.

Notable concerns included the family's reliance on food banks and the limited availability of basic necessities such as toiletries and cleaning supplies. The parents expressed feelings of shame and guilt regarding their inability to provide for their children.

Assessment:
The assessment indicates a high level of risk to the well-being and safety of the family members, particularly the children. The prolonged period of financial hardship has resulted in significant emotional distress, with signs of depression and anxiety evident among both parents and children.

Family dynamics appear strained, with tensions between Mr. and Mrs. Kauriala visible during our conversation. The parents' relationship appears to be under strain, with some indication that they may be considering separation. The children's behavior suggests a need for additional support and guidance to mitigate the effects of their parents' stress.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Immediate Referral: The family will be referred to local food banks and social services organizations to provide access to basic necessities and emotional support.
2. Employment Support: Mr. Kauriala will be connected with local employment agencies and job training programs to assist in securing stable employment.
3. Family Counseling: A referral will be made for the family to attend counseling sessions, focusing on relationship dynamics, stress management, and parenting strategies.
4. Regular Follow-up Visits: The social services team will schedule regular follow-up visits (every 6 weeks) to monitor the family's progress, provide ongoing support, and address any emerging concerns.

Timeline:

* Immediate referral to local food banks and social services organizations
* Employment support referrals within the next 2 weeks
* Family counseling sessions scheduled for the following week
* Regular follow-up visits every 6 weeks for the next 12 months
