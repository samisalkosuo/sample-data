Social Services Visit Report

Date: 23 January 2025
Location: Soini, Finland
Visit Type: At-risk youth intervention visit

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to assess the well-being of a young couple, Antti and Aino, expecting their first child in Soini, Finland. The visit was conducted as part of an at-risk youth intervention program due to concerns about the couple's living situation and potential risks to their unborn child.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, I observed that Antti and Aino were welcoming and cooperative during the initial meeting. They provided information about their current living arrangements, which consisted of a small apartment in Soini. The apartment was clean and well-maintained, with basic furniture and household items. However, there were signs of recent financial strain, including unpaid bills and limited food storage.

During our conversation, Antti expressed concerns about the upcoming arrival of their child, citing worries about providing for their future needs. Aino seemed more optimistic, but also acknowledged the challenges they would face as new parents. The couple's interactions with each other were affectionate and supportive, suggesting a strong foundation for their relationship.

Notable Concerns:
While the living conditions were generally satisfactory, there were concerns about the couple's financial stability and potential impact on their child's well-being. Antti's worries about providing for their future needs highlighted the need for support and guidance in managing finances and planning for parenthood.

Assessment:
Based on our conversation and observations, I assessed the situation as low-risk, with some minor concerns that could be addressed through support and guidance. The couple's relationship appears strong, and they are both committed to providing a stable environment for their child. However, it is essential to monitor their financial situation and offer resources to help them manage expenses and plan for the future.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Referral to local financial counseling services to assist Antti and Aino in managing their finances and creating a budget.
2. Connection with parenting classes or workshops to support the couple's preparation for parenthood.
3. Regular follow-up visits to monitor the couple's progress, provide ongoing support, and address any emerging concerns.

Timeline:
The next visit is scheduled for 15 March 2025, six weeks after this report. During this visit, I will assess the couple's progress in managing their finances and preparing for parenthood, and provide additional support as needed.
