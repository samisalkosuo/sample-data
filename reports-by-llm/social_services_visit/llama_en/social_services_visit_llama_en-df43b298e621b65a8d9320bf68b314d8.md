Social Services Visit Report

Date: 03.10.2024
Location: Pihtipudas, Finland
Visit Type: Follow-up on school truancy report

Summary of Visit Purpose:
This visit was conducted to follow up on a recent school truancy report for the family of five residing in subsidized apartment at address 123 Koulukatu, Pihtipudas. The purpose of this visit is to assess the situation and provide support to ensure the child's education and well-being.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, I was greeted by Mrs. Lehti, the mother, who appeared concerned about her child's absence from school. She reported that her son, Juhani (age 10), has been missing school for several days due to lack of motivation and interest in his studies. The family's living conditions were found to be satisfactory, with a clean and organized home environment.

During the conversation, I observed Mrs. Lehti's emotional state as anxious and worried about her child's future. She expressed frustration with Juhani's behavior and lack of engagement in school activities. The father, Mr. Kärkkäinen, was present but seemed distant and uninvolved in the discussion. The other children, aged 7, 9, and 12, appeared to be adjusting well to their sibling's absence.

Notable concerns included Juhani's lack of motivation and interest in school, which may indicate underlying issues such as learning difficulties or social challenges. Additionally, Mrs. Lehti reported that Juhani has been spending more time playing video games and watching TV, rather than engaging in outdoor activities or hobbies.

Assessment:
Given the low severity of this case, I assessed that the family is facing a temporary challenge with Juhani's truancy. However, it is essential to monitor the situation closely to ensure the child's education and well-being. The family's living conditions and overall dynamics appear stable, but further support may be necessary to address Juhani's behavioral issues.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Schedule a meeting with Juhani's teacher to discuss his absence and develop a plan for his return to school.
2. Refer Mrs. Lehti to the Pihtipudas Parenting Support Group for guidance on managing her child's behavior and encouraging engagement in school activities.
3. Offer support services, such as counseling or behavioral therapy, to address Juhani's underlying issues contributing to his truancy.
4. Schedule a follow-up visit in six weeks to assess Juhani's progress and adjust the support plan as needed.
