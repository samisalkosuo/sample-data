Social Services Visit Report

Date: 12.09.2024
Location: Muhos, Finland
Visit Type: Post-abuse recovery support visit

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to assess the well-being of the family of five residing in a subsidized apartment in Muhos, Finland, following reports of post-abuse recovery support needs. The visit aimed to evaluate the current living conditions, interactions within the household, and emotional state of the family members.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, I was greeted by Mrs. Leena Kärkkäinen, the mother, who appeared visibly stressed but cooperative during the interview. She reported that her husband, Mr. Pekka Kärkkäinen, had been physically abusive towards her and their children in the past year. The family has been receiving post-abuse recovery support services from our organization for several months.

During the visit, I observed a generally chaotic living environment, with cluttered rooms and disorganized storage areas. The children (ages 8, 10, and 12) seemed anxious and withdrawn, while Mrs. Kärkkäinen appeared to be managing the household responsibilities alone. Mr. Kärkkäinen was not present during my visit.

Assessment:
Given the moderate case severity, I assessed that the family is in need of continued support to address the emotional trauma caused by the abuse. The living conditions and interactions within the household suggest a high level of stress and anxiety, which may impact the children's well-being and development.

Notable concerns include:

* Mrs. Kärkkäinen's reported feelings of isolation and lack of social support
* The children's reluctance to discuss their experiences with me
* Mr. Kärkkäinen's absence during my visit, which may indicate a lack of engagement in the recovery process

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
Based on my assessment, I recommend the following:

1. Continued post-abuse recovery support services for Mrs. Kärkkäinen and her children.
2. Referral to a local counseling service specializing in family dynamics and trauma-informed care.
3. Assistance with household organization and cleaning to reduce stress and improve living conditions.
4. Regular check-ins with the family to monitor progress, provide emotional support, and address any emerging concerns.

Timeline for further visits:

* Next visit: 6 weeks from today's date
* Follow-up assessments: every 2 months for the next year
