Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this post-hospital discharge visit was to assess the well-being and safety of Eeva-Liisa Kukkiaho following her recent hospitalization. The visit aimed to evaluate her living conditions, provide support, and identify any potential risks or concerns.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival, I met with Eeva-Liisa in her home, where she was receiving assistance from a family member. She appeared calm and cooperative during our conversation. Her living space was clean and organized, with minimal clutter. The household had access to basic necessities, including food, clothing, and personal care items.

Eeva-Liisa reported feeling anxious about returning to her daily routine after hospitalization but expressed gratitude for the support provided by her family member. She also mentioned difficulties with managing her medication regimen, which she attributed to her intellectual disability. The family member reported that Eeva-Liisa had been experiencing some mood swings and irritability since discharge.

Assessment:
The overall assessment indicates a low-severity case, with minimal risks identified. However, the client's anxiety and difficulties with medication management warrant close monitoring and support. The presence of a supportive family member is a positive factor in her well-being.

Family dynamics were observed to be stable, with the family member providing emotional support and assistance with daily tasks. Eeva-Liisa's intellectual disability was not a significant concern during the visit, as she demonstrated basic self-care skills and was able to communicate effectively.

Notable concerns included Eeva-Liisa's potential for overmedication or undermedication due to her cognitive limitations. It is essential to monitor her medication regimen closely and provide education on proper dosing and administration.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Schedule regular follow-up visits (every 2-3 months) to assess Eeva-Liisa's progress, adjust medication regimens as needed, and provide ongoing support.
2. Refer Eeva-Liisa to a local support group for individuals with intellectual disabilities, which may help her connect with peers and develop social skills.
3. Provide education on proper medication management, including dosing instructions and administration techniques, to ensure Eeva-Liisa's safety and well-being.
