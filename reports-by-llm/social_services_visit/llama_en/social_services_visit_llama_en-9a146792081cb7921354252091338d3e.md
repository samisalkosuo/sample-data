Social Services Visit Report

Date: 28 April 2025
Location: Nurmijärvi, Finland
Visit Type: Parenting Education Follow-up
Case Severity: Low

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct a follow-up assessment on the parenting education program for single father, Juhani Rantanen, and his one-year-old child, Aino. The previous visit in January 2025 highlighted Juhani's efforts to improve his parenting skills and provide a stable environment for his child. This visit aimed to evaluate the progress made since then and identify any areas requiring further support.

Observations During the Visit:
During the visit, I observed that Juhani had successfully implemented some of the strategies discussed during the previous sessions, such as establishing a daily routine and creating a safe play area for Aino. However, I noted that Juhani still struggles with managing his own stress levels, which can impact his ability to respond to Aino's needs. The living conditions in their small apartment were satisfactory, with adequate space for both Juhani and Aino.

Notable concerns included Aino's occasional tantrums, which seemed to be triggered by Juhani's busy schedule or lack of attention. I also observed that Juhani tends to rely heavily on his phone for entertainment and social interaction, potentially affecting his ability to engage with Aino in a meaningful way.

Assessment:
Based on the observations during this visit, it appears that Juhani has made progress in implementing some parenting strategies, but still requires support in managing stress and developing healthy coping mechanisms. The low case severity indicates that the situation is stable, and with continued support, Juhani can maintain a positive environment for Aino.

Family dynamics were observed to be generally harmonious, with Juhani demonstrating a strong desire to provide for his child's well-being. However, it is essential to continue monitoring the situation to ensure that Aino's needs are being met and that Juhani receives adequate support to manage stress and maintain a healthy work-life balance.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
Based on this assessment, I recommend:

1. Continued parenting education sessions to focus on stress management and emotional regulation techniques.
2. Referral to local counseling services for Juhani to address his own mental health and develop healthier coping mechanisms.
3. Regular check-ins with Aino's pediatrician to monitor her development and address any concerns that may arise.

Timeline:

* Next follow-up visit: 30 June 2025
* Parenting education sessions: bi-weekly, starting from 15 May 2025
* Counseling services: scheduled for 10 May 2025

Conclusion:
This visit demonstrated that Juhani Rantanen is committed to providing a stable and nurturing environment for his child. With continued support and guidance, he can build on the progress made during this follow-up visit and maintain a positive trajectory for Aino's development.
