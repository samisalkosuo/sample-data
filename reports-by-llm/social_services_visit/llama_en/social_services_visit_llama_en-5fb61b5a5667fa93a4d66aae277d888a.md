Social Services Visit Report

Date: 10.09.2024
Location: Savukoski, Finland
Visit Type: Routine family wellbeing visit
Case Severity: Critical

Summary of Visit Purpose:
This routine family wellbeing visit was conducted to assess the current situation and living conditions of 17-year-old Aino Kauriala, who is aging out of foster care. The primary concern is her well-being and potential risks associated with transitioning to independent living.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival at the address, 12300 Savukoski, Finland (Aino's family home), I was greeted by Aino herself. She appeared anxious and hesitant to discuss her situation. Her mother, Liisa Kauriala, was present but seemed overwhelmed and struggled to provide detailed information about their living arrangements.

During the visit, it became apparent that the household is facing significant financial challenges. Unemployment benefits for Liisa are insufficient, and Aino's father has been absent from the family for several years. The home is in a state of disrepair, with signs of neglect evident in the overgrown garden and outdated furniture.

Aino expressed concerns about her future, stating that she feels unprepared to manage her own life and is worried about finding employment. She also mentioned difficulties in maintaining relationships with her peers due to feelings of isolation and insecurity.

Assessment:
The situation is critical due to Aino's vulnerability as a youth aging out of foster care. The lack of stable financial support, combined with the household's living conditions, poses significant risks to her well-being and future prospects. It is essential to address these concerns promptly to ensure Aino receives the necessary support.

Family dynamics are strained, with Liisa struggling to cope with the responsibilities of caring for Aino alone. There appears to be a lack of communication between family members, which may exacerbate existing tensions.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Immediate Referral: Arrange for Aino to receive counseling services to address her emotional and psychological needs.
2. Financial Assistance: Explore options for providing financial support to help Liisa manage the household expenses and ensure Aino's basic needs are met.
3. Housing Support: Investigate local housing options that can provide temporary or permanent accommodation for Aino, ensuring she has a safe and stable environment.
4. Employment Support: Connect Aino with job training programs or employment services to enhance her employability skills.
5. Follow-up Visits: Schedule regular visits (every 6-8 weeks) to monitor Aino's progress, provide ongoing support, and address any emerging concerns.

Timeline for Further Visits:

* Next visit: 12.11.2024
* Follow-up visits: Every 6-8 weeks until Aino reaches a stable living situation
