Social Services Visit Report

Date: 26 February 2025
Location: Inkoo, Finland
Visit Type: Post-hospital discharge visit

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to assess the well-being of Mrs. Maria Lehtonen, an elderly individual with dementia, following her recent hospitalization in Helsinki. The single caregiver, Mr. Juhani Lehtonen, was identified as the primary support person for Mrs. Lehtonen.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, I observed that the living conditions were modest but clean and well-maintained. However, there were signs of clutter and disorganization in the home, which may contribute to Mrs. Lehtonen's confusion and agitation. The caregiver reported that Mrs. Lehtonen had become increasingly agitated and restless since her hospitalization, requiring more frequent reassurance and support.

During our conversation, I noted that Mr. Juhani seemed overwhelmed by his caregiving responsibilities, often feeling isolated and unsupported. He expressed concerns about Mrs. Lehtonen's increasing dependence on him for basic needs, such as bathing and dressing. The caregiver also reported difficulties in managing Mrs. Lehtonen's medication regimen, which may be contributing to her agitation.

Notable Concerns:
The most pressing concern during this visit was the risk of falls and injuries associated with Mrs. Lehtonen's mobility issues. The caregiver reported that she had recently witnessed Mrs. Lehtonen attempting to walk without assistance, which increased the risk of accidents. Additionally, I observed signs of malnutrition and dehydration, which may be related to Mrs. Lehtonen's decreased appetite and difficulty swallowing.

Assessment:
Given the urgent case severity, it is clear that Mrs. Lehtonen requires immediate support to prevent further decline in her physical and emotional well-being. The caregiver's isolation and lack of respite care are significant concerns, as they exacerbate his own stress levels and ability to provide adequate care.

Family Dynamics:
The relationship between Mr. Juhani and Mrs. Lehtonen appears strained, with the caregiver feeling overwhelmed and resentful towards his role. This dynamic may contribute to Mrs. Lehtonen's agitation and confusion, as she becomes increasingly dependent on her son for emotional support.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Immediate Referral: I will refer Mr. Juhani and Mrs. Lehtonen to the local Home Care Services, which can provide respite care and support with daily living activities.
2. Medical Review: A review of Mrs. Lehtonen's medication regimen is necessary to ensure that her medications are being managed effectively and safely.
3. Fall Prevention Measures: I will work with the caregiver to implement fall prevention measures, such as installing handrails and non-slip mats in the bathroom, and providing assistance with mobility exercises.
4. Nutrition and Hydration Support: A nutritionist will be referred to assess Mrs. Lehtonen's dietary needs and provide guidance on meal planning and preparation.
5. Follow-up Visits: Regular follow-up visits will be scheduled to monitor Mrs. Lehtonen's progress, provide ongoing support, and address any emerging concerns.

Timeline for Further Visits:
The next visit is scheduled for 10 March 2025, at which time I will assess the effectiveness of the implemented interventions and make any necessary adjustments to the care plan.
