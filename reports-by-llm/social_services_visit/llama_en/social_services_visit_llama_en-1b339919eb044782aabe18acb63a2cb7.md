Social Services Visit Report

Date: 18 April 2025
Location: Tohmajärvi, Finland
Visit Type: Youth Mentoring Program Assessment

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to assess the suitability of a youth mentoring program for an elderly man living with his adult daughter in Tohmajärvi. The referral was made due to concerns about the potential benefits of social interaction and emotional support for the elderly individual, who is reported to be experiencing moderate levels of loneliness and isolation.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival at the residence, I observed a warm and welcoming environment, with the elderly man and his daughter engaging in conversation while preparing lunch. The living conditions were clean and tidy, indicating a sense of stability and routine. However, during our conversation, it became apparent that the elderly man's social interactions are limited to occasional phone calls with family members and friends, suggesting a need for more frequent and meaningful connections.

The adult daughter appeared to be caring and supportive, but also seemed overwhelmed by her responsibilities as a primary caregiver. She expressed concerns about her father's mental health and reported feeling isolated herself due to the demands of caregiving. Notable concerns included the elderly man's potential for depression and anxiety, as well as his limited access to community resources and social activities.

Assessment:
Based on my observations and discussions with the family, I assess the situation as moderate in severity. The elderly man's isolation and loneliness are significant concerns, particularly given his age and potential vulnerability to mental health issues. However, the adult daughter's caring nature and willingness to support her father suggest that she is a positive influence in his life.

The youth mentoring program could provide an opportunity for the elderly man to engage with younger individuals, share experiences, and develop new skills. This could help alleviate feelings of loneliness and isolation, while also promoting social interaction and emotional well-being.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
In light of my assessment, I recommend that the following actions be taken:

1. Referral to local community resources: The elderly man should be referred to local organizations providing support services for older adults, including mental health counseling and social activities.
2. Youth mentoring program enrollment: The elderly man should be enrolled in a youth mentoring program, which would provide him with regular opportunities for social interaction and emotional support.
3. Support for the adult daughter: The adult daughter should receive support and guidance on managing her caregiving responsibilities, including respite care services and counseling to address her own feelings of isolation.

Timeline:
* Within the next two weeks, I will follow up with the family to assess their progress in accessing community resources and enrolling in the youth mentoring program.
* In six months, I will conduct a follow-up visit to evaluate the effectiveness of the interventions and make any necessary adjustments.
