Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct a follow-up assessment on the well-being of [Child's Name], a minor residing with their non-custodial parent, [Parent's Name], in Taivassalo. The visit aimed to evaluate the living conditions, interactions between the child and the caregiver, and overall situation to ensure that the child's needs are being met.

Upon arrival, I observed that the household was tidy and well-maintained. The child, [Child's Name], appeared happy and engaged during our interaction, sharing stories about their daily activities and interests. The non-custodial parent, [Parent's Name], seemed to be providing adequate care and support, although there were moments of tension when discussing the child's needs.

During the conversation, it became apparent that [Parent's Name] is facing some financial difficulties, which may impact their ability to provide for the child's basic needs. However, they expressed a willingness to seek assistance from local social services and community resources.

Assessment:
Given the low case severity, the overall situation appears stable, with no immediate concerns regarding the child's safety or well-being. The non-custodial parent's intentions to seek support and resources indicate a positive attitude towards addressing potential challenges. However, it is essential to monitor the situation closely to ensure that [Parent's Name] receives necessary assistance and that the child's needs are being met.

Family dynamics seemed to be stable, with both parties showing respect for each other's boundaries and needs. The child appeared comfortable in their living arrangement, and there were no reports of neglect or abuse.
