Social Services Visit Report

Date: 08.12.2024
Location: Tornio, Finland
Visit Type: Emergency housing verification
Case Severity: Low

Summary of Visit Purpose:
This emergency housing verification visit was conducted to assess the living conditions and well-being of a teenager in foster care residing at the address provided. The purpose of this visit is to verify the suitability of the current accommodation and ensure that the child's basic needs are being met.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival, I observed that the teenager, 16-year-old Emma, was present and cooperative during the visit. She reported feeling comfortable in her current living arrangement with foster parents, Mr. and Mrs. Kauriala, who reside at the address. The home environment appeared clean and well-maintained, with adequate space for Emma's personal belongings.

During our conversation, Emma expressed some concerns about her school performance and social interactions with peers. However, she also mentioned that her foster parents have been supportive and encouraging, helping her to stay on top of her studies. I observed a positive relationship between Emma and the Kauriala family members, who demonstrated empathy and understanding towards her needs.

Notable Concerns:

* Emma reported occasional conflicts with her foster siblings, but these were resolved through open communication and mediation by the foster parents.
* The home's internet connection was limited, which may impact Emma's access to online resources for schoolwork and social activities.

Assessment:
Based on my observations during this visit, I assess that the current living situation is suitable for Emma's needs. The Kauriala family has demonstrated a commitment to providing a stable and supportive environment, which aligns with the low case severity level. However, it is essential to monitor Emma's progress in her school performance and social interactions.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

* Schedule a follow-up visit within 6 weeks to assess Emma's continued well-being and academic progress.
* Arrange for internet access support through local authorities or organizations that provide digital literacy training and equipment for foster care families.
* Consider referring Emma to counseling services to address her concerns about school performance and social interactions.

Timeline for Further Visits:

* Follow-up visit: 08.03.2025
* Re-evaluation of case severity: 15.03.2025
