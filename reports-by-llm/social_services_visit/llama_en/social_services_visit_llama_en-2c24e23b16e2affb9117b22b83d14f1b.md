Social Services Visit Report

Visit Date: 23.12.2024
Location: Pieksämäki, Finland
Visit Type: Routine family wellbeing visit
Household Composition: Young adult living alone
Case Severity: Moderate

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this routine family wellbeing visit was to assess the current situation and provide support to a young adult living alone in Pieksämäki. The visit was conducted based on previous case notes indicating moderate concerns regarding the individual's wellbeing.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival, the young adult, Ms. Aino Lehtonen (born 1998), greeted me warmly and invited me into her apartment. The living conditions were generally clean and tidy, with some signs of disorganization in the kitchen area. Ms. Lehtonen reported that she had been struggling to manage her daily routine and was experiencing feelings of loneliness and isolation.

During our conversation, I observed that Ms. Lehtonen seemed anxious and fidgety at times, but also open and willing to discuss her concerns. She mentioned that she had recently lost her part-time job due to company restructuring and was currently receiving unemployment benefits. Despite this, she expressed difficulties in finding motivation and purpose.

Notable concerns included Ms. Lehtonen's limited social connections and lack of engagement in local community activities. She reported feeling disconnected from her family, who live several hours away, and struggling to maintain relationships with friends due to her busy work schedule.

Assessment:
Based on the observations during the visit, it appears that Ms. Lehtonen is facing challenges related to her employment status, social isolation, and emotional wellbeing. The moderate case severity suggests that while there are concerns, they do not yet indicate a high level of risk or crisis situation.

The assessment also highlights the importance of addressing Ms. Lehtonen's feelings of loneliness and disconnection. Providing support for her to engage in local community activities and reconnect with friends and family could help alleviate these concerns.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Referral to local employment services: I will refer Ms. Lehtonen to the Pieksämäki Employment Office to explore options for vocational training or education.
2. Social connections support group: I recommend enrolling Ms. Lehtonen in a social connections support group, which would provide her with opportunities to meet new people and build relationships in the local community.
3. Regular check-ins: I will schedule regular check-in visits with Ms. Lehtonen (every 6-8 weeks) to monitor her progress, address any concerns, and provide ongoing support.

Timeline for Follow-up Visits:

* Next visit: 15.01.2025
* Subsequent visits: every 6-8 weeks until case severity is re-evaluated
