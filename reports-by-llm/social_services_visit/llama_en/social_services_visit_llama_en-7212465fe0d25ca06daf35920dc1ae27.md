Social Services Visit Report

Date: 23 February 2025
Location: Lieto, Finland
Visit Type: Child Visitation Supervision Report

Summary of Visit Purpose:
This visit was conducted as part of an ongoing child visitation supervision report to assess the well-being and safety of the child in a cohabiting couple household with mental health challenges. The purpose of this visit is to evaluate the current living conditions, interactions between the parents, and the overall dynamics within the family.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival at the residence, I observed that the household was tidy, but there were signs of disorganization in the kitchen and living areas. The couple, Juhani and Leena, greeted me warmly and provided a brief overview of their daily routines. However, during our conversation, it became apparent that they struggled to manage stress and anxiety, which occasionally led to raised voices and intense discussions.

The child, 7-year-old Aino, was present during the visit and appeared generally happy and well-adjusted. She engaged in play with me and demonstrated a good understanding of social skills. However, I noticed that Juhani and Leena often interrupted each other or spoke over Aino when discussing her, which may have been perceived as dismissive or unresponsive.

Assessment:
Based on the observations during this visit, it is clear that the couple's mental health challenges are impacting their ability to provide a stable and supportive environment for Aino. The household dynamics appear strained at times, but both parents seem committed to providing a loving home for their child. However, I am concerned about the potential risks of escalating conflicts or neglecting Aino's emotional needs.

Case Severity: Moderate

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
In light of this visit, I recommend that Juhani and Leena continue attending counseling sessions to manage their mental health challenges. It is essential for them to develop effective communication skills and learn to prioritize Aino's emotional well-being.

I also suggest that the couple consider seeking additional support from a family therapist or counselor who can provide guidance on managing stress, conflict resolution, and parenting strategies. Furthermore, I recommend that Juhani and Leena establish a regular routine for self-care activities, such as exercise, meditation, or hobbies, to help manage their mental health.

In terms of follow-up, I propose scheduling the next visit in six weeks to assess the couple's progress and evaluate any changes in household dynamics. Additionally, I will contact the local healthcare provider to inquire about potential resources for family therapy services.
