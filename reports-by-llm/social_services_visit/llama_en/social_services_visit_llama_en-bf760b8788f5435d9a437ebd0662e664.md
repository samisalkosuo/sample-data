Social Services Visit Report

Date: 06.01.2025
Location: Raasepori, Finland
Visit Type: Immigration Case Monitoring Visit

Summary of Visit Purpose:
This visit was conducted to monitor the well-being of the family in question, who are currently undergoing immigration proceedings. The primary concern is the reported neglect case, which necessitates regular check-ins to ensure the safety and care of the children.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival at the residence located at Kruununhaka 12, Raasepori, I was greeted by the parents, Mr. and Mrs. Antti Laaksonen. They appeared anxious but cooperative during the initial conversation. The living conditions were generally satisfactory, with a clean and organized home environment. However, there were signs of minor disorganization in the kitchen area.

During the interaction, both parents expressed concern about their children's behavior and academic performance. They reported that their 8-year-old son, Juhani, has been having difficulty adjusting to his new school due to language barriers. The mother also mentioned that her 5-year-old daughter, Aino, has been experiencing nightmares related to the recent move.

Notable concerns included the parents' apparent lack of clear boundaries and discipline, which may be contributing to the children's behavioral issues. Additionally, there were some signs of emotional distress among both parents, particularly during discussions about their immigration status.

Assessment:
Given the low severity of the neglect case, it is essential to continue monitoring the family's situation while providing support and guidance. The parents' cooperation and willingness to address their concerns are positive indicators. However, further intervention may be necessary to establish clear boundaries and discipline, as well as provide additional emotional support for both parents.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Schedule a follow-up visit in 6 weeks to assess the family's progress and adjust the support plan accordingly.
2. Refer the family to local counseling services to address their emotional distress and develop strategies for managing stress related to their immigration status.
3. Arrange for additional support from the school to help Juhani adjust to his new environment, including language classes or tutoring if necessary.
4. Provide the parents with information on local resources for parenting classes and workshops to enhance their skills in setting clear boundaries and discipline.

Sign-off:

I recommend that further action be taken to support this family in addressing their concerns and ensuring a safe and nurturing environment for their children.
