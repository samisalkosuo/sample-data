Social Services Visit Report

Date: 07.02.2025
Location: Savonlinna, Finland
Visit Type: Parenting Education Follow-up

Summary of Visit Purpose:
This visit was conducted as a follow-up to the initial parenting education session with the family, which was referred due to concerns about neglect. The purpose of this visit is to assess the family's progress in addressing these concerns and to identify any additional support needs.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival at the residence located at Kauppienkatu 12, Savonlinna, I observed a two-parent household with two children aged 6 and 8. The parents, Mr. and Mrs. Lehtonen, greeted me warmly and provided an overview of their current situation. They reported that they have been attending parenting education sessions regularly and have made efforts to improve their communication and conflict resolution skills.

During the visit, I observed a generally clean and organized living environment, with adequate food and clothing for the family. However, there were some signs of clutter and disorganization in certain areas, which may indicate ongoing challenges with household management. The children seemed happy and engaged during our interactions, but I noted that they appeared to be avoiding discussing their feelings or concerns about their home life.

Notable concerns included Mr. Lehtonen's tendency to dominate conversations and dismiss his wife's opinions, as well as Mrs. Lehtonen's reported feelings of frustration and isolation. The parents acknowledged these dynamics and expressed a desire to work on improving their communication and teamwork.

Assessment:
Based on the observations during this visit, I assess the situation as moderate in terms of severity. While there are some signs of neglect, such as disorganization and lack of open communication, the family appears to be making efforts to address these concerns through parenting education. However, ongoing support and guidance will be necessary to ensure that they can sustain these improvements.

Recommendations:

1. Continue regular parenting education sessions to reinforce skills and provide additional support.
2. Refer Mr. and Mrs. Lehtonen to a couples therapy session to address communication and conflict resolution issues.
3. Provide the family with resources and referrals for local support services, such as counseling or household management workshops.
4. Schedule follow-up visits every 6-8 weeks to monitor progress and provide ongoing support.

Timeline:

* Next visit: 03.04.2025
* Follow-up sessions: Every 6-8 weeks until the case is closed

Conclusion:
This visit provided an opportunity to assess the family's progress in addressing concerns about neglect and to identify areas for further support. With continued parenting education, couples therapy, and access to local resources, I am confident that Mr. and Mrs. Lehtonen can work towards creating a more positive and supportive home environment for their children.
