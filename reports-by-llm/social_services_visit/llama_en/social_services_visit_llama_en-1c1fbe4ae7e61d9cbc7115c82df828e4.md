Date: 30 March 2025

Location: 123 Kuningatarinkatu, Maarianhamina, Finland

Visit Type: Safety Plan Monitoring Visit

Summary of Visit Purpose:
This visit was conducted to monitor the safety plan for Mrs. Sofia Lehtonen, an elderly woman with early dementia symptoms residing at her home in Maarianhamina. The purpose of this visit is to assess the current situation, ensure the implementation of the safety plan, and identify any potential risks or concerns that may require further support.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, I observed Mrs. Lehtonen engaging in activities such as watching TV and listening to music, which brought her joy and comfort. The living conditions were generally clean and tidy, with some areas requiring minor attention. Notable observations included:

* Mrs. Lehtonen's early dementia symptoms were evident, causing occasional confusion and disorientation.
* She required assistance with daily tasks, such as bathing and dressing, due to cognitive decline.
* Family members reported that Mrs. Lehtonen was experiencing anxiety and agitation when left alone for extended periods.

Assessment:
Based on the observations during this visit, it is clear that Mrs. Lehtonen's early dementia symptoms are progressing, posing a risk to her safety and well-being. The family dynamics appear to be supportive, with family members actively involved in caring for Mrs. Lehtonen. However, the need for increased support and supervision is evident.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
To ensure Mrs. Lehtonen's continued safety and well-being, I recommend:

* Regular home visits every two weeks to monitor her condition and provide additional support as needed.
* Referral to a local dementia support group to connect with others who share similar experiences.
* Collaboration with the family to develop a comprehensive care plan that addresses Mrs. Lehtonen's specific needs.

Timeline for Further Visits:
The next scheduled visit will be on 15 April 2025, at which time I will assess the implementation of the safety plan and provide additional support as needed.

Conclusion:
This visit has highlighted the importance of ongoing monitoring and support for individuals with early dementia symptoms. By working together with Mrs. Lehtonen's family and providing necessary resources, we can ensure her continued safety and well-being in the Maarianhamina community.
