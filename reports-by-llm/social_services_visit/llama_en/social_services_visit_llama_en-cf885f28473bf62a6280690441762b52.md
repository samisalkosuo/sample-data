Date: 14.04.2025
Location: Mikkeli, Finland
Visit Type: Disability support assessment
Case Severity: High

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct a disability support assessment for the single father, Mr. Antti Lehtonen, and his child, 8-year-old Aino Lehtonen, residing at the address below. The assessment aimed to evaluate their living situation, assess the child's needs, and identify potential risks or concerns that may require further intervention.

Address:
Korvenkatu 12, 52100 Mikkeli, Finland

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival, Mr. Lehtonen greeted me warmly and provided an overview of his daily routine. He reported struggling to manage the household due to his own disability, which affects his mobility and ability to perform tasks requiring physical effort. Aino, who has been diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), exhibited signs of anxiety and restlessness during our interaction.

The living conditions were generally satisfactory, with a well-maintained home environment. However, the father's reliance on assistive technology and limited access to healthcare services raised concerns about his ability to provide adequate care for Aino in the future.

Assessment:
Given the high case severity, it is evident that Mr. Lehtonen and Aino face significant challenges in their daily lives. The father's disability and limited resources compromise his capacity to provide a stable and supportive environment for his child. Aino's ADHD diagnosis and associated behavioral issues require specialized support, which may not be readily available in the local community.

The assessment also highlighted potential risks, including:

1. Increased risk of neglect or abandonment due to Mr. Lehtonen's disability.
2. Limited access to healthcare services, exacerbating Aino's ADHD symptoms.
3. Potential impact on Aino's educational and social development if support is not provided.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Referral to local disability organizations for assistance with daily living tasks and household management.
2. Collaboration with the Finnish National Health Service (HELSINKI) to access specialized healthcare services for Aino, including ADHD treatment and behavioral therapy.
3. Arrangement of regular home visits by a social worker to monitor the situation and provide ongoing support.
4. Consideration of respite care options to alleviate Mr. Lehtonen's caregiving burden.

Timeline:

* Within 2 weeks: Follow-up meeting with Mr. Lehtonen and Aino to assess progress and adjust recommendations as needed.
* Within 6 weeks: Re-evaluation of the situation to determine the effectiveness of implemented support services.

Conclusion:
This visit highlighted the need for comprehensive support services to address the complex needs of Mr. Lehtonen and Aino. The proposed actions and follow-up will aim to mitigate risks, improve their living conditions, and enhance their overall well-being.
