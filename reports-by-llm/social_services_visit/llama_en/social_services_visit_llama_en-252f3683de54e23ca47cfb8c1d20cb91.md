Social Services Visit Report

Date: 26 April 2025
Location: Toivakka, Finland
Visit Type: Juvenile Probation Compliance Visit

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to assess the juvenile's compliance with the probation conditions and evaluate the living situation in light of their severe mental health condition. The visit aimed to identify any concerns or risks that may impact the juvenile's well-being and provide recommendations for support services.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival, I met with 17-year-old Juha Lappi at his family's residence on Kyl√§nkatu 12, Toivakka. Juha appeared anxious and fidgety during our initial conversation. He reported that he had been struggling to manage his medication regimen and was experiencing increased symptoms of depression.

The living conditions were modest but clean, with some signs of disorganization. The adult caregiver, Mr. Lappi's mother, seemed overwhelmed by the demands of caring for Juha due to her own severe mental health condition. She reported feeling isolated and struggling to access local support services.

During our conversation, I observed that Juha was hesitant to discuss his daily activities and social interactions. He mentioned that he had been avoiding school due to anxiety and was having trouble connecting with peers. His mother expressed concern about Juha's increasing isolation and the potential impact on his mental health.

Assessment:
The situation appears moderate in terms of case severity, with some concerns regarding Juha's mental health, social isolation, and compliance with probation conditions. The adult caregiver's severe mental health condition is exacerbating the family dynamics, creating a challenging environment for Juha.

Notable concerns include:

* Juha's increasing symptoms of depression and anxiety
* His avoidance of school and social interactions
* The adult caregiver's limited access to support services and her own mental health struggles

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Referral to local mental health services: I will arrange for a meeting with a mental health professional to assess Juha's condition and develop a treatment plan.
2. Support for the adult caregiver: I will connect Mr. Lappi's mother with local support groups and resources to help her manage her own mental health condition.
3. School attendance monitoring: I will work with Juha's school to monitor his attendance and provide additional support if needed.
4. Regular follow-up visits: I recommend scheduling regular visits (every 6 weeks) to assess Juha's progress, address any concerns, and adjust the support plan as necessary.

Timeline for Follow-up Visits:

* Next visit: 10 June 2025
* Subsequent visits: every 6 weeks until 31 December 2025
