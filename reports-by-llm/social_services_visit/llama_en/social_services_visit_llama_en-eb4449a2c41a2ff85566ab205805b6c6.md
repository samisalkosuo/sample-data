Social Services Visit Report

Date: 27 August 2024
Location: Sauvo, Finland
Visit Type: Homeless Outreach Visit

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct a homeless outreach assessment for a woman who has been identified as being at risk due to her recent history of domestic abuse. The visit aimed to assess her current living situation and provide support services to ensure her safety and well-being.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival, I met with Ms. Maria Lehtonen (case name) at her temporary accommodation in Sauvo. She appeared nervous but cooperative during our conversation. Her living conditions were basic, with limited access to basic amenities such as a kitchenette and bathroom facilities. The flat was clean, but there were signs of recent stress, including unopened mail and unwashed dishes.

During the interview, Maria shared her experiences of domestic abuse and how it has affected her mental health and daily life. She reported feeling isolated and struggling to access support services due to language barriers and lack of familiarity with local resources. Despite these challenges, she expressed a desire to rebuild her life and regain independence.

Assessment:
The situation appears low-risk at this time, but ongoing support is necessary to ensure Maria's safety and well-being. Her emotional state is fragile, and it is essential to provide her with access to counseling services and practical assistance to address her basic needs.

Family Dynamics:
Maria reported that she has no family members in Finland and is not in contact with her abuser. However, she expressed concerns about her ability to navigate the Finnish social system and access necessary resources without support.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Referral to local counseling services: Arrange for Maria to receive individual counseling sessions to address her emotional trauma and develop coping strategies.
2. Language support: Provide Maria with language classes or interpretation services to facilitate her interaction with local authorities and access to social services.
3. Basic needs assistance: Offer practical help with accessing basic amenities, such as a kitchenette and bathroom facilities, to improve her living conditions.
4. Ongoing monitoring: Schedule regular follow-up visits to assess Maria's progress, provide ongoing support, and address any emerging concerns.

Timeline for Further Visits:
The next visit is scheduled for 10 September 2024, with the possibility of additional visits as needed.
