Social Services Visit Report

Date: 21 August 2024
Location: Parainen, Finland
Visit Type: Support plan review meeting

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct a support plan review meeting for the rehabilitated ex-offender, Mr. Juhani Laaksonen, residing at his address in Parainen. The review aimed to assess the progress made since the last visit and identify any concerns or areas requiring further support.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, I met with Mr. Laaksonen at his residence, located at Kauppatorinkatu 12, 05900 Parainen. He appeared anxious and hesitant during our initial conversation, but gradually opened up about his daily life and struggles. Notable observations include:

* Mr. Laaksonen reported difficulty in maintaining employment due to lack of relevant skills and experience.
* He expressed concerns about his ability to reintegrate into society, citing feelings of isolation and loneliness.
* The living conditions at the residence were satisfactory, with basic amenities available.

Assessment:
Given the critical case severity, it is evident that Mr. Laaksonen requires ongoing support to address his rehabilitation goals. The assessment highlights several risks:

* Lack of employment opportunities may exacerbate feelings of isolation and frustration.
* Limited social connections and community involvement increase the risk of relapse or reoffending.
* The individual's emotional state appears fragile, with anxiety and depression symptoms evident.

Family dynamics:
No family members were present during the visit. However, Mr. Laaksonen reported occasional contact with his estranged family members, which he described as strained and unsupportive.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Referral to employment training programs: Arrange for Mr. Laaksonen to participate in vocational training sessions to enhance his employability skills.
2. Social connections and community involvement: Encourage Mr. Laaksonen to join local community groups or clubs that align with his interests, aiming to increase social connections and a sense of belonging.
3. Mental health support: Schedule regular counseling sessions to address anxiety and depression symptoms, ensuring access to necessary resources and support services.
4. Follow-up visits: Schedule bi-weekly visits for the next six weeks to monitor progress, provide ongoing support, and adjust the support plan as needed.

Timeline:

* Next visit: 04 September 2024
* Employment training program: To be arranged within the next two weeks
* Mental health counseling sessions: Scheduled for bi-weekly sessions starting from 12 September 2024
