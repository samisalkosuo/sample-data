Social Services Visit Report

Date: 01.03.2025
Location: Nurmijärvi, Finland
Visit Type: Substance Abuse Support Visit

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to assess the situation of the separated couple, Juhani Lehtonen and Sari Tuomisto, with shared custody of their two children in Nurmijärvi. The visit aimed to evaluate the current state of substance abuse support services for both individuals and their family dynamics.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival at the Lehtonen residence, I observed a generally calm atmosphere, but noticeable tension between Juhani and Sari. They had agreed to meet separately with me to discuss their individual struggles with substance abuse. Both reported feeling overwhelmed and struggling to cope with daily life. Juhani mentioned that he has been using substances to manage stress related to his job as a fisherman, while Sari expressed concerns about her own use of prescription medication for anxiety.

During the separate interviews, I noted that both individuals seemed hesitant to discuss their substance abuse issues openly, but were willing to share information with me. The living conditions at the residence appeared satisfactory, with basic necessities and household chores being managed by Juhani. However, there were signs of disorganization and clutter in certain areas, which may indicate ongoing stress.

Assessment:
The situation appears moderate in terms of substance abuse severity, but there are concerns about the impact on family dynamics and daily life. Both Juhani and Sari seem willing to seek support, but require guidance and resources to overcome their struggles. The shared custody arrangement poses additional challenges, as both parents must work together to ensure the well-being of their children.

Notable Concerns:
- The couple's communication appears strained, with a lack of open discussion about substance abuse and its effects on their relationship.
- Juhani's job as a fisherman may exacerbate his stress levels, potentially leading to increased substance use.
- Sari's anxiety and prescription medication use require closer monitoring to ensure safe and effective management.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Referral to local substance abuse support groups for both Juhani and Sari, with a focus on individualized support and family counseling.
2. Collaboration with the Finnish Social Security Institution (Kela) to explore potential financial assistance for Juhani's job-related stress management and Sari's medication costs.
3. Regular follow-up visits every 6-8 weeks to monitor progress, address emerging concerns, and provide ongoing support.

Timeline:
- Next visit: 15.04.2025
- Follow-up phone call: 10.03.2025 (to discuss initial findings and assess Juhani's job-related stress management)
