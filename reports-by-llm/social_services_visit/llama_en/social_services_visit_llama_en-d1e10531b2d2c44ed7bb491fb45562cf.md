Social Services Visit Report

Date: 30.12.2024
Location: Polvijärvi, Finland
Visit Type: Unaccompanied Minor Intake Assessment

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The visit was conducted to assess the well-being and safety of an unaccompanied minor living with an adult in Polvijärvi, Finland. The case is classified as urgent due to concerns about the adult's severe mental health condition and its potential impact on the child.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival at the address, 12300 Polvijärvi, Finland (Kirkonkylänkatu 10), I observed a cluttered living environment with signs of disorganization. The adult, Mr. Juhani Kukkiaho, was seated on the couch, appearing lethargic and withdrawn. He seemed hesitant to engage in conversation, providing limited information about his mental health condition.

The child, 12-year-old Emma Kukkiaho, was present but appeared anxious and fidgety. She reported feeling isolated and lonely due to her father's increasing reclusiveness. The living conditions were deemed unsanitary, with visible signs of mold and mildew in the kitchen area.

Assessment:
The adult's severe mental health condition poses a significant risk to the child's emotional and physical well-being. Mr. Kukkiaho's lack of engagement and limited communication skills suggest a need for professional support. The child's feelings of isolation and loneliness are concerning, as they may be vulnerable to exploitation or neglect.

Family dynamics appear strained, with the adult's behavior potentially contributing to the child's emotional distress. The living environment is unsanitary and disorganized, which could exacerbate health issues.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Immediate Referral: Arrange for an emergency psychiatric evaluation for Mr. Kukkiaho to address his severe mental health condition.
2. Child Support Services: Provide Emma with temporary foster care arrangements until a more permanent solution can be found.
3. Home Safety Assessment: Conduct a thorough assessment of the living environment to identify potential hazards and provide recommendations for improvement.
4. Follow-up Visits: Schedule regular visits (every 2 weeks) to monitor the child's well-being, provide emotional support, and assess the adult's progress in treatment.

Timeline:

* Immediate: Arrange emergency psychiatric evaluation for Mr. Kukkiaho
* Within 1 week: Provide Emma with temporary foster care arrangements
* Within 2 weeks: Conduct home safety assessment and provide recommendations for improvement

Next Steps:
The social services team will work closely with the local healthcare authorities, child support services, and other relevant agencies to ensure the child's immediate needs are met. A follow-up report will be submitted in two weeks to assess progress and adjust the plan as necessary.
