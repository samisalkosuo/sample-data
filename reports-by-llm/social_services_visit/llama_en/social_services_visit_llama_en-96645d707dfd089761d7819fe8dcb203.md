Social Services Visit Report

Date: 15 July 2025
Location: Salla, Finland
Visit Type: Immigration case monitoring visit

Summary of Visit Purpose:
This visit was conducted to monitor the well-being of the young couple, Antti and Aino Laaksonen, who are expecting their first child. As part of our immigration case monitoring program, we aimed to assess the couple's living conditions, family dynamics, and overall situation to ensure that they have a stable environment for their growing family.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival at the Laaksonen residence, located at Koulukatu 12, Salla, Finland, I was greeted by Antti and Aino. They appeared welcoming and cooperative during the visit. The couple's home is modest but clean and well-maintained. The living room and kitchen are furnished with basic furniture, while the bedroom areas are decorated with personal touches. The couple has been actively preparing for the arrival of their child, with a nursery set up in one of the spare rooms.

During our conversation, Antti and Aino expressed their excitement about becoming parents and their desire to build a stable life in Finland. They discussed their plans for education, employment, and integration into Finnish society. The couple's communication was positive, and they demonstrated mutual respect and support for each other.

Notable concerns were not identified during the visit. However, it is essential to note that the couple has been experiencing some financial strain due to Antti's recent job loss. They have been relying on social services support to help with basic expenses.

Assessment:
Based on our observations and conversation, I assess the situation as low-severity. The Laaksonens appear to be a stable and supportive couple who are actively preparing for their new role as parents. While they face some financial challenges, they have demonstrated resilience and resourcefulness in managing their situation.

Family dynamics were positive, with Antti and Aino displaying mutual respect and trust. Their communication was open, and they seemed to be on the same page regarding their goals and aspirations. The couple's emotional state appeared stable, with a sense of excitement and anticipation about becoming parents.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
Based on our findings, I recommend that we continue to monitor the Laaksonen family's situation through regular visits. We will also provide ongoing support with financial assistance and guidance on accessing local resources.

In the coming months, it is essential to:

1. Schedule a follow-up visit in 6-8 weeks to assess the couple's progress in addressing their financial challenges.
2. Provide referrals for employment services and job training programs to help Antti regain employment.
3. Offer support with integrating into Finnish society, including language classes and cultural orientation.

Timeline:
The next scheduled visit will be on 20 October 2025. We will also schedule a meeting with the Laaksonens to discuss their progress and provide ongoing support.
