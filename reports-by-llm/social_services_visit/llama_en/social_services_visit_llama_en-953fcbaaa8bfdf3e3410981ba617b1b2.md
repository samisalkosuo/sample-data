Social Services Visit Report

Date: 16 February 2025
Location: Sipoo, Finland
Visit Type: Refugee Integration Support Visit

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to assess the well-being and integration needs of Mrs. Maria Rodriguez, a refugee from Venezuela, who has been residing in Sipoo for several months. Given her reported early dementia symptoms and elderly status, it was essential to evaluate her living conditions, social interactions, and access to support services.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival at Mrs. Rodriguez's residence ( address: Kivikatu 12, 02520 Sipoo), I observed a generally calm and cooperative demeanor from the client. She greeted me warmly and provided information about her daily routine, which includes assistance with household chores and limited social interactions due to her condition.

The living conditions were found to be satisfactory, with basic amenities and access to necessary services within walking distance. However, there were concerns regarding the lack of stimulation and engagement activities for Mrs. Rodriguez, which could exacerbate her dementia symptoms.

During our conversation, I noted that Mrs. Rodriguez reported feeling isolated and struggling to connect with local Finnish-speaking community members due to language barriers. She expressed a desire to learn more about Finnish culture and participate in social events but felt uncertain about how to access these opportunities.

Assessment:
Given the low case severity, it was evident that Mrs. Rodriguez requires support to address her isolation and improve her integration into Finnish society. The elderly woman's dementia symptoms pose a moderate risk of exacerbation if left unaddressed. It is essential to prioritize her social engagement and provide access to language training and cultural activities.

Family Dynamics:
During the visit, I did not observe any immediate family members present at the residence. Mrs. Rodriguez reported that she lives alone with occasional visits from her adult children who reside in Venezuela. She expressed a desire for more frequent contact with her children but acknowledged the challenges of maintaining relationships across international borders.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Arrange language training sessions (minimum 2 hours, twice a week) to enhance Mrs. Rodriguez's Finnish language skills and facilitate social interactions.
2. Refer Mrs. Rodriguez to local dementia support groups and organizations offering cognitive stimulation activities tailored for individuals with early dementia symptoms.
3. Schedule regular home visits (every 4-6 weeks) to monitor her condition, provide emotional support, and address any emerging concerns.
4. Facilitate connections between Mrs. Rodriguez and local community centers or cultural organizations offering Finnish language classes, social events, and cultural activities.

Timeline for Follow-up Visits:
The next scheduled visit will take place on 20 March 2025, with a follow-up assessment to be conducted every 6 weeks thereafter until further notice.
