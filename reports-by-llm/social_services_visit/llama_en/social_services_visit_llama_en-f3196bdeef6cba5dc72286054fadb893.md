Social Services Visit Report

Date: 20 August 2024
Location: Parikkala, Finland
Visit Type: Social reintegration assessment

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct a social reintegration assessment for the family at address 12300 Kymenpuisto, Parikkala, Finland. The visit aimed to evaluate the current situation and provide support to ensure a smooth transition following recent custody changes within the blended family.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival, I met with the mother, Ms. Leena Rissanen, who reported that the children, Aino (12) and Eero (9), were adjusting well to their new living arrangements. The father, Mr. Juhani Rissanen, was present for part of the visit but seemed somewhat distant during our conversation. The family's living conditions appeared satisfactory, with adequate space and basic necessities available.

During the interaction, I observed a sense of unease among the children, who occasionally expressed concerns about their father's absence. Ms. Leena reported that she had been working hard to maintain stability and provide emotional support to her children during this challenging time. The family's dynamics seemed strained at times, but overall, they appeared to be managing.

Assessment:
Given the recent custody changes and blended family context, I assessed the situation as low-risk. However, it is essential to continue monitoring the family's progress and providing support to ensure a smooth reintegration process. The children's emotional well-being and adjustment to their new living arrangements will be crucial in determining the long-term success of this arrangement.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Schedule regular check-ins with Ms. Leena Rissanen to monitor the family's situation and provide ongoing support.
2. Arrange a meeting between Mr. Juhani Rissanen and his children, Aino and Eero, to facilitate communication and bonding.
3. Refer the family to local counseling services to address any emotional or psychological concerns that may arise during this transition period.
4. Schedule a follow-up visit in six weeks to assess the family's progress and provide additional support as needed.

Timeline for Further Visits:

* 20 October 2024: Follow-up visit to assess the family's progress
* 15 December 2024: Review of case files and preparation for potential future interventions
