Social Services Visit Report

Date: 22.10.2024
Location: Pihtipudas, Finland
Visit Type: Substance Abuse Support Visit

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to assess the well-being of an unaccompanied minor residing in temporary housing in Pihtipudas, Finland. The minor's substance abuse issues were identified as a high-priority concern due to their potential impact on their physical and emotional health, as well as their ability to thrive in a care environment.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, I met with the unaccompanied minor, who was 16 years old, at the temporary housing facility. The minor appeared anxious and withdrawn, displaying signs of stress and fatigue. They reported using cannabis and amphetamines on a regular basis, citing feelings of loneliness and isolation as contributing factors to their substance abuse.

During our conversation, I observed that the minor's living conditions were satisfactory, with access to basic necessities such as food, clothing, and hygiene facilities. However, the minor expressed concerns about their lack of social connections and limited opportunities for recreational activities in the area.

The minor's emotional state was characterized by feelings of hopelessness and despair, which they attributed to their substance abuse issues. They reported experiencing sleep disturbances, mood swings, and decreased motivation, all of which were exacerbated by their use of substances.

Assessment:
Given the high severity of this case, I assessed that the unaccompanied minor is at significant risk of harm due to their substance abuse issues. The minor's emotional state and behaviors suggest a need for intensive support and guidance to address their underlying issues.

Furthermore, I observed that the temporary housing facility may not be equipped to provide adequate support services for minors with substance abuse concerns. Therefore, I recommended that the facility consider partnering with local social services organizations to provide additional support and resources for residents in similar situations.

Family Dynamics:
Unfortunately, the minor reported having limited contact with their family members, citing conflicts and disagreements as reasons for their separation. This lack of family support may exacerbate the minor's emotional state and substance abuse issues.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Referral to local substance abuse treatment services: I recommended that the minor be referred to a specialized substance abuse treatment program in Pihtipudas, which can provide intensive therapy and support.
2. Family reunification efforts: I suggested that social services organizations consider initiating family reunification efforts to reconnect the minor with their family members, provided that it is deemed safe and suitable for both parties.
3. Temporary housing facility partnership: I recommended that the temporary housing facility partner with local social services organizations to provide additional support services for residents in similar situations.
4. Regular follow-up visits: I suggested scheduling regular follow-up visits to monitor the minor's progress, adjust treatment plans as needed, and ensure that their needs are being met.

Timeline:
The next scheduled visit will be on 29.10.2024, at which time I will assess the minor's progress, provide additional support, and make any necessary adjustments to their treatment plan.
