Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this routine family wellbeing visit was to assess the current situation and dynamics within the transitional housing residence in Lemi, Finland. The visit aimed to identify any potential concerns or risks that may impact the well-being of the household members.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival, I observed a calm and cooperative atmosphere among the residents. The living area was tidy, with minimal clutter, indicating a sense of organization and responsibility. However, during conversations, it became apparent that some residents were struggling to maintain their daily routines due to lingering effects of rehabilitation. One resident, Juhani Laaksonen (age 35), expressed frustration with his lack of job prospects and felt isolated from the community.

Notable concerns included:

* Limited access to recreational activities and social events outside of the residence
* Insufficient support for residents with ongoing mental health needs

Assessment:
The situation appears moderate in terms of risk, with some potential concerns that require attention. The household's ability to maintain a stable environment is compromised by limited resources and inadequate support services. However, the cooperative attitude among residents suggests a willingness to engage with social services and address these issues.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Referral for recreational activities: Arrange for regular outings and events outside of the residence to promote socialization and stress relief.
2. Mental health support: Collaborate with local mental health services to provide additional support for residents with ongoing needs.
3. Storage solutions: Explore options for improving storage space, such as installing shelving units or providing storage containers.
4. Follow-up visit: Schedule a follow-up visit in 6 weeks to assess progress and address any emerging concerns.

Timeline:

* Referral for recreational activities: Within the next 2 weeks
* Mental health support: To be arranged through local mental health services within the next month
