Date: 20 October 2024
Location: Kalajoki, Finland
Visit Type: Homeless Outreach Visit

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct a homeless outreach assessment for a family residing in Kalajoki, Finland. The family, consisting of [Client Name: Leena Kauriala] and her two children (ages 8 and 10), has been experiencing chronic domestic violence within the household. Following previous reports from local authorities and social services, this visit aimed to assess their current living situation, provide support, and facilitate necessary referrals for further assistance.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival at the designated address (Korvenkyl√§nkatu 12, Kalajoki), I observed Leena Kauriala and her children in a state of distress. The family's living conditions were substandard, with limited access to basic necessities such as clean water, electricity, and adequate heating. The home was cluttered with belongings, indicating a lack of organization and stability.

During our conversation, Leena expressed feelings of fear, anxiety, and hopelessness regarding her situation. She reported that the violence had escalated in recent weeks, leading to physical injuries and emotional trauma for both herself and her children. I observed signs of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms in the children, including difficulty sleeping and increased irritability.

Assessment:
Given the urgent nature of this case, it is clear that Leena Kauriala and her family require immediate support to ensure their safety and well-being. The chronic domestic violence has created a toxic environment, exacerbating the family's vulnerability. It is essential to address the root causes of this situation and provide Leena with access to specialized services, including counseling, legal assistance, and safe housing options.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. **Emergency Housing Referral**: Arrange for temporary accommodation through local social services to ensure the family's immediate safety and stability.
2. **Counseling Services**: Refer Leena Kauriala and her children to a trauma-informed counseling program to address PTSD symptoms, emotional distress, and coping strategies.
3. **Legal Assistance**: Provide Leena with information about local legal resources and support services to aid in her pursuit of a restraining order or other protective measures against the perpetrator.
4. **Follow-up Visits**: Schedule regular follow-up visits (every 2 weeks) to monitor the family's progress, provide ongoing support, and adjust recommendations as necessary.

Timeline for Further Visits:
- Next visit: 10 November 2024
- Follow-up visits will be scheduled bi-weekly until a stable living situation is established.

This report concludes with the understanding that Leena Kauriala and her children require comprehensive support to overcome their current challenges. By providing timely assistance, we can help mitigate the risks associated with chronic domestic violence and foster a safer, more stable environment for this family.
