Social Services Visit Report

Date: 12.07.2025
Location: Kirkkonummi, Finland
Visit Type: Domestic Violence Risk Assessment

Summary of Visit Purpose:
This visit was conducted to assess the risk of domestic violence in a multi-generational household with financial difficulties, as reported by the client, Ms. Maria Lehtonen (born 1980), residing at address 123 Kruununhakaentie, Kirkkonummi.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, I observed a tense atmosphere within the household, with family members avoiding direct eye contact and displaying subdued body language. The living room was cluttered with unpaid bills, empty food packets, and worn-out furniture. Ms. Lehtonen appeared visibly stressed, with dark circles under her eyes and a faint bruise on her left cheek.

During our conversation, I noted that the household's financial struggles were exacerbated by Mr. Lehtonen's (born 1975) unemployment and lack of job prospects in his age group. The couple's children, aged 12 and 15, seemed anxious about their parents' situation and worried about their own future. The elderly grandmother, Mrs. Sofia Jensen (born 1942), appeared to be the most vulnerable member of the household, relying heavily on her grandchildren for emotional support.

Assessment:
Given the low severity of this case, I observed a general sense of unease and tension within the household, but no immediate signs of physical or emotional abuse. However, the family's financial difficulties and Mr. Lehtonen's unemployment pose potential risks to their well-being. The children's anxiety and Mrs. Jensen's vulnerability highlight the need for targeted support.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Referral to local job training programs to assist Mr. Lehtonen in finding employment.
2. Connection with a social worker specializing in family dynamics to provide guidance on managing household finances and improving communication among family members.
3. Invitation to a domestic violence support group, focusing on emotional well-being and stress management techniques.
4. Regular follow-up visits (every 6 months) to monitor the household's situation and adjust recommendations as needed.

- Follow-up assessments: 06.07.2026, 12.01.2027
