Social Services Visit Report

Date: 03.12.2024
Location: Lapinlahti, Finland
Visit Type: Emergency housing verification

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct an emergency housing verification for the family of five residing in subsidized apartment at address 123 Koulukatu, Lapinlahti, Finland. The referral indicated concerns regarding the family's living conditions and potential risks to their well-being.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival, I met with Mrs. Maria Lehtonen, the mother, who appeared visibly stressed and anxious. She reported that her husband had been absent for several days due to unemployment and was struggling to find work. The children (ages 8, 10, 12, and 14) seemed withdrawn and quiet, while their youngest child (2 years old) was energetic but fidgety.

The living conditions were satisfactory, with clean and well-maintained apartment. However, I observed signs of financial strain, including unpaid bills and limited food storage. The family's furniture and appliances appeared worn out, suggesting a need for replacement or repair.

During the conversation, Mrs. Lehtonen expressed concerns about her husband's absence and its impact on their household income. She also mentioned difficulties in accessing local employment services due to language barriers. The children seemed to be coping with the situation, but their emotional state was evident during our interaction.

Assessment:
The family's situation is characterized as moderate risk, with potential for exacerbation if left unaddressed. The absence of a primary breadwinner and limited financial resources pose significant challenges to their well-being. However, the children's resilience and Mrs. Lehtonen's proactive approach to seeking support demonstrate a capacity for coping.

Notable concerns include:

* Unemployment and lack of income
* Limited access to employment services due to language barriers
* Potential strain on family relationships

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Referral to local employment services, with a focus on language support and job placement assistance.
2. Coordination with the Finnish Social Security Administration to explore potential financial assistance for the family.
3. Scheduling of future visits to monitor progress and provide ongoing support.
