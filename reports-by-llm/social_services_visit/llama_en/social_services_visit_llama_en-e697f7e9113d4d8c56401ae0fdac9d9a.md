Social Services Visit Report

Date: 24.03.2025
Location: Kökar, Finland
Visit Type: Post-abuse recovery support visit

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to assess the well-being and safety of a teenager in foster care following allegations of post-abuse trauma. The visit aimed to evaluate the current living situation, interactions with caregivers, and overall emotional state of the child.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival at the residence, I observed that the teenager, Aino Luukkainen (age 16), was initially hesitant to engage in conversation. However, as the visit progressed, she began to open up about her experiences and feelings. The foster caregivers, Ms. Maria Lehtinen and Mr. Juhani Kärkkäinen, appeared concerned but supportive.

The living conditions were generally satisfactory, with a clean and organized home environment. However, I noted that Aino's belongings were scattered throughout the room, suggesting potential emotional regulation challenges. During our conversation, Aino expressed feelings of anxiety and sadness, which seemed to be related to her recent experiences.

Assessment:
Given the case severity of urgent, it is clear that Aino requires immediate support and intervention to address her post-abuse trauma. The foster caregivers have demonstrated a willingness to provide care, but their ability to effectively manage Aino's emotional state and provide trauma-informed support needs to be further assessed and developed.

Notable concerns include:

* Aino's reluctance to discuss specific details of the abuse
* Her difficulty in regulating her emotions, leading to increased anxiety and sadness
* The need for additional support services to address Aino's trauma and promote healing

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Immediate Referral: Arrange for a multidisciplinary team meeting to discuss Aino's case and develop a comprehensive plan for her recovery.
2. Trauma-Informed Care Training: Provide the foster caregivers with training on trauma-informed care, focusing on emotional regulation, safety planning, and crisis intervention.
3. Counseling Services: Arrange for regular counseling sessions with a trained therapist specializing in trauma and adolescent support.
4. Family Meetings: Schedule bi-weekly family meetings to ensure open communication and collaboration between Aino, the foster caregivers, and other relevant professionals.
5. Follow-up Visits: Schedule regular follow-up visits (every 2 weeks) to monitor Aino's progress, adjust the care plan as needed, and provide ongoing support.

Timeline:

* Within the next 48 hours: Arrange for a multidisciplinary team meeting to discuss Aino's case
* Within the next 2 weeks: Provide trauma-informed care training to the foster caregivers
* Within the next 4 weeks: Establish regular counseling sessions with a trained therapist

By implementing these recommendations, we can ensure that Aino receives the necessary support and resources to recover from her post-abuse trauma and thrive in her new environment.
