Social Services Visit Report

Date: 14 August 2024
Location: Föglö, Finland
Visit Type: Support Plan Review Meeting

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to review the support plan for an unaccompanied minor residing in temporary housing in Föglö, Finland. The visit aimed to assess the current situation, identify any changes or concerns, and provide guidance on how to address them.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival at the temporary housing facility, I met with the minor, whose name is Aino Salmi (age 16). Aino appeared anxious but cooperative during our conversation. She reported feeling overwhelmed by her current living situation and struggling to cope with the transition from foster care to independent living.

The living conditions were satisfactory, with clean and well-maintained facilities. However, I noted that Aino's personal belongings were limited, and she was in need of additional support with organization and time management skills.

During our conversation, it became apparent that Aino is struggling to connect with her peers at school due to social anxiety. She also expressed concerns about her future plans and aspirations, feeling uncertain about her options for education and employment.

Assessment:
Given the low case severity, I observed a generally stable situation with minimal risks. However, Aino's emotional state and struggles with social connections indicate a need for ongoing support and guidance. The temporary housing facility has been providing basic care, but additional resources are required to address Aino's specific needs.

Family Dynamics:
Aino reported that she had limited contact with her biological family due to parental conflict and separation. She expressed a desire to reconnect with them in the future, but requires support and guidance on how to navigate these relationships safely.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Referral to local youth organizations: I recommended that Aino be connected with local youth organizations in Föglö, which can provide additional support with social connections, education, and employment.
2. Time management and organization skills training: Aino will benefit from training on time management and organization skills to help her cope with daily responsibilities and academic pressures.
3. Regular check-ins and progress monitoring: I suggested regular check-ins with Aino to monitor her progress, provide ongoing support, and make adjustments to the support plan as needed.
4. Follow-up visit within 6 weeks: A follow-up visit will be scheduled in 6 weeks to assess Aino's progress and adjust the support plan accordingly.

Timeline for Further Visits:

* 6 weeks from today: Follow-up visit to review Aino's progress and adjust the support plan
* 12 weeks from today: Review of Aino's education and employment plans, with a focus on connecting her with local resources and opportunities
