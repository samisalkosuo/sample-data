Social Services Visit Report

Date: 13 June 2025
Location: Salla, Finland
Visit Type: Support plan review meeting

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct a support plan review meeting for the multi-generational household in Salla, Finland. The family had been referred to social services due to financial difficulties and concerns about their well-being. This visit aimed to assess the current situation, evaluate risks, and discuss potential solutions with the family.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, I was greeted by Mrs. Leena Kärkkäinen, a 55-year-old mother of two, who welcomed me warmly. The household consists of Mrs. Kärkkäinen, her husband, Mr. Pekka Kärkkäinen (60), and their adult children, Emma (25) and Juhani (22). During the meeting, I observed that the family was struggling to make ends meet, with limited financial resources and a high reliance on government assistance.

The living conditions were modest, with some signs of wear and tear. The kitchen and dining area were clean, but the furniture was old and in need of replacement. The bedrooms were tidy, but the children's rooms showed signs of clutter and disorganization. I noted that the family had recently experienced a power outage due to a faulty electrical connection.

The emotional state of the family members was generally calm, although there were moments of tension during discussions about financial matters. Mrs. Kärkkäinen expressed concern about her husband's health, as he has been experiencing chronic pain and mobility issues. The children seemed supportive but also frustrated with their parents' financial situation.

Assessment:
Based on my observations and discussions, I assessed the situation as low-severity, with some concerns about the family's financial stability and living conditions. However, I noted that the family is resilient and resourceful, with a strong support network within the community. The power outage highlighted the need for basic maintenance and repairs to ensure the household's safety and well-being.

Family dynamics were generally positive, with a strong sense of unity and cooperation among the family members. However, there were moments of conflict, particularly around financial decisions. I recommended that the family consider seeking additional support from local community organizations or government agencies to address their financial difficulties.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
Based on my assessment, I recommend the following:

1. Referral to local community organizations for financial assistance and counseling.
2. Assistance with basic maintenance and repairs to ensure the household's safety and well-being.
3. Regular check-ins with the family to monitor progress and provide ongoing support.
4. Consideration of alternative housing options if the current living conditions become unsustainable.

Timeline:

* Within the next two weeks, I will follow up with Mrs. Kärkkäinen to discuss the referral process and provide additional information about available resources.
* In three months, I will conduct a follow-up visit to assess the family's progress and adjust recommendations as needed.
