Social Services Visit Report

Date: 13 June 2025
Location: Lieto, Finland
Visit Type: Family Reunification Progress Check

Summary of Visit Purpose:
This visit was conducted to assess the progress of the family reunification process in a blended family with recent custody changes. The high case severity indicates concerns about the well-being and safety of the children involved.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival, I met with Mrs. Leena Kärkkäinen (mother) at her residence on Kruununhaka 12, Lieto. She reported that the father, Mr. Antti Kärkkäinen, has been struggling to maintain a stable relationship with the children due to his work schedule and personal issues.

During our conversation, I observed Mrs. Kärkkäinen's emotional state as anxious and worried about the children's well-being. She expressed concerns about the father's ability to provide for their needs and ensure their safety. The children, aged 8 and 10, seemed hesitant to discuss their feelings about the recent custody changes.

Upon inspecting the living conditions, I noted that the residence is clean and tidy, but there are signs of stress and tension in the home. The father's absence was evident, with no indication of his whereabouts or activities during the day.

Assessment:
The assessment reveals a complex family dynamic with high levels of stress, anxiety, and uncertainty. The recent custody changes have caused significant emotional distress for all parties involved. The mother's concerns about the father's ability to provide for the children's needs are valid, given his inconsistent work schedule and personal issues.

However, it is essential to acknowledge that Mr. Kärkkäinen has made efforts to maintain a relationship with the children, despite the challenges he faces. A more in-depth assessment of his situation is necessary to determine the best course of action for the family's reunification.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Referral to counseling services: I recommend that Mrs. Kärkkäinen and Mr. Kärkkäinen attend joint counseling sessions to address their relationship issues and develop a plan for co-parenting.
2. Support services for children: The Social Services department will provide support services for the children, including individual counseling and activities to help them cope with the recent custody changes.
3. Regular progress checks: I propose regular visits (every 6 months) to monitor the family's progress, assess the father's involvement in the children's lives, and make adjustments to the reunification plan as needed.

Timeline for Further Visits:

* Next visit: 13 December 2025
* Follow-up assessments: Every 6 months until the case is closed
