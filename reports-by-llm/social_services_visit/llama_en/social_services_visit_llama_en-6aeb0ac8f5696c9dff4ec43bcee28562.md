Social Services Visit Report

Date: 28 October 2024
Location: Vimpeli, Finland
Visit Type: Follow-up on school truancy report

Summary of Visit Purpose:
This visit was conducted to follow up on a recent school truancy report concerning Mr. Juhani Kärkkäinen, an elderly man living with his adult daughter, Ms. Maria Kärkkäinen, in Vimpeli, Finland. The purpose of the visit is to assess the situation, identify potential risks, and provide support to ensure the well-being of both Mr. Kärkkäinen and Ms. Kärkkäinen.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, I met with Ms. Maria Kärkkäinen in the living room. She appeared anxious and concerned about her father's recent absences from school. She reported that Mr. Kärkkäinen has been experiencing memory loss and difficulty with daily tasks due to his age-related health issues. The household was tidy, but there were signs of clutter and disorganization in some areas.

During the conversation, I observed a strained relationship between Ms. Kärkkäinen and her father. They seemed to be struggling with communication, and their interactions were often tense. Mr. Kärkkäinen appeared disengaged and withdrawn, while Ms. Kärkkäinen expressed frustration and worry about his behavior.

Assessment:
The situation is considered high-risk due to the potential impact of Mr. Kärkkäinen's truancy on his health and well-being. The elderly man's memory loss and difficulty with daily tasks may be exacerbated by his lack of engagement in educational activities, which could lead to further decline in his physical and mental health.

Furthermore, the strained relationship between Ms. Kärkkäinen and her father raises concerns about their emotional support system. As the primary caregiver, Ms. Kärkkäinen is shouldering a significant burden, which may be affecting her own well-being.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
Based on my assessment, I recommend the following:

1. Referral to local healthcare services: Arrange for Mr. Kärkkäinen to receive regular medical check-ups and cognitive assessments to address his memory loss and health issues.
2. Support for Ms. Kärkkäinen: Provide her with counseling services to cope with the emotional demands of caring for her father, as well as assistance with household chores and daily tasks.
3. Educational support for Mr. Kärkkäinen: Arrange for him to participate in educational programs or activities that cater to his interests and abilities, such as cognitive stimulation classes or online courses.
4. Regular follow-up visits: Schedule bi-weekly visits to monitor the situation, provide ongoing support, and adjust recommendations as needed.

Timeline:
The next visit is scheduled for 11 November 2024, one week after this report. I will also maintain regular contact with Ms. Kärkkäinen via phone calls and emails to ensure her well-being and address any concerns she may have.
