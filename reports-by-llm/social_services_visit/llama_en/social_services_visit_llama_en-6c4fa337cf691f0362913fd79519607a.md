**Social Services Visit Report**

**Visit Date:** 26.12.2024
**Location:** Siikajoki, Finland
**Visit Type:** At-risk youth intervention visit
**Household Composition:** Multi-generational household with financial difficulties
**Case Severity:** Urgent

**Summary of Visit Purpose:**
The purpose of this visit was to assess the well-being and safety of a multi-generational household in Siikajoki, Finland, who are facing financial difficulties. The at-risk youth intervention visit aimed to identify potential risks and provide support to prevent further deterioration.

**Observations During the Visit:**

Upon arrival, I observed a tense atmosphere within the household. The family members were visibly stressed, with signs of fatigue and anxiety evident on their faces. The living conditions were modest, with limited access to basic amenities such as clean water and adequate heating. The kitchen was cluttered, and trash was scattered throughout the room.

During our conversation, I learned that the family has been struggling financially for several months. The father, Juhani, is unemployed, while his wife, Leena, works part-time to make ends meet. Their children, 16-year-old Mikael and 13-year-old Aino, are at risk of dropping out of school due to lack of resources.

Mikael expressed feelings of frustration and hopelessness about his future, while Aino seemed withdrawn and anxious. The family's emotional state was further exacerbated by the recent loss of their mother, who passed away six months ago. Leena reported feeling overwhelmed with childcare responsibilities and managing the household on her own.

**Assessment:**
The situation is urgent due to the risk of neglect and abandonment of the children. The family's financial difficulties have created a stressful environment that may lead to further deterioration if not addressed promptly. The lack of access to basic amenities, combined with the emotional toll of recent losses, poses significant risks to the well-being of all household members.

The multi-generational dynamics within the household are complex and require careful consideration. Juhani's unemployment and Leena's part-time work create a precarious financial situation, while Mikael and Aino's school attendance is at risk due to lack of resources. The family's emotional state is fragile, with feelings of anxiety, frustration, and hopelessness prevalent.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up:**

1. **Immediate Referral:** Refer the family to local social services for emergency assistance with basic needs such as food, clothing, and heating.
2. **Counseling Services:** Arrange for individual counseling sessions for Mikael and Aino to address their emotional distress and school attendance concerns.
3. **Job Training and Placement:** Assist Juhani in finding employment through local job training programs or placement services.
4. **Financial Assistance:** Explore options for financial assistance, such as government subsidies or non-profit organizations providing support to low-income families.
5. **Follow-up Visits:** Schedule regular follow-up visits (every 2 weeks) to monitor the family's progress and adjust recommendations as needed.

**Timeline:**

* Immediate referral and emergency assistance: within 24 hours
* Counseling sessions for Mikael and Aino: scheduled for January 8, 2025
* Job training and placement support for Juhani: arranged for January 15, 2025

**Conclusion:**
This visit highlights the urgent need for support to prevent further deterioration of this multi-generational household. The recommended actions and follow-up plan aim to address immediate needs while providing long-term solutions to mitigate risks and promote stability.
