Social Services Visit Report

Date: 21 January 2025
Location: Kauhava, Finland
Visit Type: Follow-up on school truancy report

Summary of Visit Purpose:
This visit was conducted to follow up on a school truancy report received for the client, Ms. Leena Rissanen, residing in transitional housing post-rehabilitation in Kauhava. The purpose of this visit is to assess the situation, evaluate the risks, and provide support to ensure Ms. Rissanen's reintegration into society.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival at the transitional housing facility, I was greeted by the resident manager, who provided an overview of the household dynamics. Ms. Rissanen was present during my visit and appeared cooperative but slightly anxious. She reported that she had been struggling to find employment due to her limited Finnish language skills acquired during rehabilitation.

During our conversation, it became apparent that Ms. Rissanen is making efforts to improve her language proficiency through local classes. However, she expressed concerns about balancing work and education responsibilities. The household environment was generally clean and organized, with a focus on supporting residents' independence.

Notable Concerns:
While the overall situation appears stable, there were some observations suggesting potential risks:

1. Limited access to employment opportunities due to language barriers.
2. Ms. Rissanen's anxiety about balancing work and education responsibilities.
3. The need for continued support in reintegration into society.

Assessment:
Given the low case severity, it is evident that Ms. Rissanen is actively engaged in her rehabilitation process and making efforts to improve her situation. However, ongoing support and guidance are necessary to ensure successful reintegration.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Referral to local employment services for language training and job placement assistance.
2. Regular follow-up appointments with the client to monitor progress and address any emerging concerns.
3. Collaboration with the transitional housing facility to provide additional support and resources, such as counseling or life skills training.

Timeline:
The next scheduled visit will be in 6 weeks to assess Ms. Rissanen's progress and adjust recommendations accordingly.
