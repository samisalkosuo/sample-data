Social Services Visit Report

Date: 09.07.2025
Location: Siikalatva, Finland
Case Reference Number: SS-2023-0012

Summary of Visit Purpose:
This follow-up visit was conducted to assess the situation of Mr. Juhani Lehtonen (born 1950) and his adult daughter, Ms. Maria Lehtonen (born 1985), in their residence at Koulukatu 12, Siikalatva, Finland. The purpose of this visit is to evaluate the progress made since our initial report on school truancy concerns, which prompted a referral from the local school authorities.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, I was greeted by Ms. Maria Lehtonen, who provided an update on her father's well-being and daily routine. Mr. Juhani Lehtonen appeared to be in moderate discomfort due to his chronic back pain, which he manages with medication and occasional physical therapy sessions. The living conditions were generally satisfactory, with a clean and organized home environment.

During our conversation, I observed that Ms. Maria Lehtonen has been actively involved in supporting her father's daily needs, including managing his medication schedule and accompanying him to medical appointments. However, she expressed concerns about the impact of Mr. Juhani's truancy on their social life and relationships with family members.

Assessment:
The situation remains moderate in severity, with ongoing risks related to Mr. Juhani's chronic health conditions and potential exacerbation of his mental health due to social isolation. The close relationship between Ms. Maria Lehtonen and her father appears to be a stabilizing factor, but the lack of engagement in educational activities may have long-term consequences for Mr. Juhani's cognitive development.

Family dynamics are generally positive, with Ms. Maria Lehtonen taking on a caregiving role that has helped maintain their living situation. However, there is a need for continued support and resources to address Mr. Juhani's mental health and social isolation.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Referral to local healthcare services: Arrange for regular follow-up appointments with the primary care physician and physical therapist to monitor Mr. Juhani's condition.
2. Support group attendance: Encourage Ms. Maria Lehtonen to participate in a support group for caregivers of elderly individuals, which will provide her with emotional support and practical advice on managing her father's needs.
3. Educational activities: Explore options for Mr. Juhani to engage in educational activities, such as online courses or local adult education programs, to address his truancy concerns.
4. Regular home visits: Schedule bi-weekly home visits to monitor the living situation and provide ongoing support.

Timeline:
- Bi-weekly home visits will be scheduled until further notice.
- Follow-up appointment with the primary care physician will be arranged within the next two weeks.
- Support group attendance is encouraged, with a goal of attending at least one session per month.
