Social Services Visit Report

Date: 24 January 2025
Location: Kitee, Finland
Visit Type: Elderly care follow-up
Household Composition: Refugee family in temporary accommodation
Case Severity: Moderate

Summary of Visit Purpose:
This visit was conducted as part of an ongoing elderly care follow-up for the refugee family residing at 123 Mikonkatu, Kitee. The purpose of this visit was to assess the well-being and living conditions of the elderly member of the household, Mr. Ali Hassan, who is a 65-year-old Syrian refugee.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, I met with Mrs. Amira Hassan, the mother of Mr. Ali, who reported that her husband's health had deteriorated since our last visit in November 2024. She expressed concern about his increasing fatigue and difficulty performing daily activities. The living conditions were found to be satisfactory, with adequate heating and lighting throughout the apartment.

During my interaction with Mrs. Hassan, I observed a sense of anxiety and worry regarding her husband's health and their future in Finland. She mentioned that Mr. Ali had been experiencing depression since his arrival in Kitee and was struggling to adapt to the new environment. The children, aged 12 and 15, were found to be doing well in school and were supportive of their parents.

Notable concerns included the lack of access to specialized medical care for Mr. Ali's chronic conditions and the limited availability of Arabic-language healthcare services in Kitee. Mrs. Hassan expressed her desire to receive guidance on navigating the Finnish healthcare system and accessing support services for her husband.

Assessment:
The assessment revealed a moderate level of risk, primarily due to Mr. Ali's deteriorating health and the family's limited access to specialized care. The emotional state of the family members was found to be tense, with Mrs. Hassan expressing feelings of worry and anxiety about their future in Finland.

Family dynamics were observed to be strained, particularly between Mr. Ali and his children, who were struggling to balance their own needs with their responsibilities towards their parents. However, the children's support for their parents was evident, and they expressed a desire to help their father with daily activities.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
Based on my assessment, I recommend that the family receives guidance on accessing specialized medical care for Mr. Ali's chronic conditions. I also suggest that Mrs. Hassan be connected with Arabic-language healthcare services in Kitee and provided with information on support services available to refugee families.

Furthermore, I propose that a home visit be scheduled within the next six weeks to assess Mr. Ali's progress and provide additional support to the family. Additionally, I recommend that the children receive counseling sessions to address any emotional or psychological challenges they may be facing as a result of their parents' health issues.

Timeline for Follow-up Visits:
* 24 March 2025: Home visit to assess Mr. Ali's progress
* 30 June 2025: Review of family's access to specialized medical care and support services
