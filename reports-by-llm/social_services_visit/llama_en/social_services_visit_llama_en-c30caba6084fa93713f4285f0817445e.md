Social Services Visit Report

Date: 29 January 2025
Location: Kangasniemi, Finland
Visit Type: Veteran support service check-in

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct a check-in on the veteran support services for Mrs. Aino Lehtonen, an elderly woman residing at her home in Kangasniemi. The visit aimed to assess her current situation, provide emotional support, and identify any potential risks or concerns that may require further intervention.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, I was greeted by Mrs. Lehtonen's caregiver, who provided a brief overview of her daily routine and any notable changes in her condition since our last visit. Upon entering the residence, I observed that the living conditions were generally clean and tidy, with some minor clutter accumulation in certain areas.

Mrs. Lehtonen herself appeared disoriented and confused at times, often requiring assistance with simple tasks such as dressing or using the bathroom. Her early dementia symptoms have worsened over the past few months, causing her to become increasingly agitated and withdrawn. I observed instances of verbal aggression towards her caregiver, which has led to a significant decrease in their interaction.

The emotional state of Mrs. Lehtonen was characterized by anxiety, frustration, and feelings of isolation. She expressed a strong desire for social interaction and connection with family members, but unfortunately, they are unable to visit regularly due to distance and caregiving responsibilities.

Assessment:
Given the high case severity, I assessed that Mrs. Lehtonen's situation requires immediate attention and support. The risk of falls, malnutrition, and social isolation is significant, and her caregiver is struggling to cope with the increasing demands of caring for a person with advanced dementia.

Family dynamics are strained due to the caregiving responsibilities, which has led to feelings of burnout and resentment among family members. It is essential that we provide support not only to Mrs. Lehtonen but also to her caregivers and family members to ensure their well-being and ability to care for her effectively.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
Based on my assessment, I recommend the following:

1. Immediate referral to a dementia support group in Kangasniemi to provide Mrs. Lehtonen with social interaction and emotional support.
2. Coordination of home care services to address her nutritional needs and prevent malnutrition.
3. Assistance in arranging regular visits from family members, either through video conferencing or in-person visits, to help alleviate feelings of isolation.
4. Support for the caregiver, including respite care and counseling, to mitigate burnout and improve their ability to cope with caregiving responsibilities.
5. Regular follow-up visits every two weeks to monitor Mrs. Lehtonen's condition and adjust our support services as needed.

Timeline:

* Within the next 48 hours: Arrange a dementia support group meeting for Mrs. Lehtonen
* Within the next week: Coordinate home care services and arrange regular family visits
* Every two weeks: Schedule follow-up visits to monitor progress and adjust support services
