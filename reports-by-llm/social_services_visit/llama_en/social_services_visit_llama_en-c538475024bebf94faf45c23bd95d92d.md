Social Services Visit Report

Date: 26 November 2024
Location: Vaasa, Finland
Visit Type: Youth Mentoring Program Assessment

Summary of Visit Purpose:
This visit was conducted as part of an assessment for the youth mentoring program in a refugee family residing in temporary accommodation in Vaasa. The purpose of this visit was to evaluate the family's suitability for the program and identify any potential needs or concerns that may impact their participation.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival, I met with Mr. Ali, the father, and his wife, Mrs. Amira, who are both refugees from Somalia. They were accompanied by their 12-year-old son, Mohamed. The family was warmly welcoming, but appeared slightly anxious about the visit. The living conditions in the temporary accommodation were satisfactory, with clean and well-maintained facilities.

During our conversation, Mr. Ali expressed concerns about his son's behavior, stating that he had become increasingly withdrawn and isolated since arriving in Finland. Mrs. Amira reported that Mohamed had difficulty adjusting to the Finnish education system and was struggling to make friends. The family also mentioned that they were experiencing some cultural and language barriers, which made it challenging for them to navigate everyday tasks.

Mohamed's behavior during the visit was observed to be generally calm and cooperative, but he seemed hesitant to engage in activities or discuss his interests. His emotional state appeared stable, but there were moments of frustration and anxiety when discussing school-related issues.

Assessment:
Given the low case severity, the family appears to be coping with their current situation, despite facing challenges related to cultural adaptation and social integration. The youth mentoring program could provide a valuable support system for Mohamed, helping him to build confidence, develop social skills, and navigate the Finnish education system.

However, it is essential to acknowledge that the family's language proficiency and cultural background may impact their ability to fully engage with the program. Additional support services, such as language classes or cultural orientation programs, might be beneficial in addressing these challenges.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Referral to a local community organization providing cultural orientation and language support for refugees.
2. Invitation to participate in a trial mentoring session to assess Mohamed's suitability for the program.
3. Regular follow-up visits (every 6 weeks) to monitor the family's progress, address any concerns, and provide ongoing support.

Timeline:

* Next visit: 15 December 2024
* Follow-up sessions: every 6 weeks until the end of the mentoring program (approximately 12 months)

Conclusion:
This assessment visit provided valuable insights into the needs and challenges faced by this refugee family. The youth mentoring program has the potential to make a positive impact on Mohamed's life, but it is essential to address the family's specific cultural and language barriers through additional support services. Regular follow-up visits will ensure that the family receives ongoing support and guidance throughout their participation in the program.
