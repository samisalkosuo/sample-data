Social Services Visit Report

Visit Date: 27 November 2024
Location: Enontekiö, Finland
Visit Type: Child Visitation Supervision Report

Summary of Visit Purpose:
This visit was conducted as part of an ongoing child visitation supervision report to assess the well-being and safety of the child in a single-parent household with a physical disability. The case severity is high due to concerns about the adult's ability to provide adequate care and support for the child.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival, I met with Ms. Aino Kauriala, a 35-year-old single mother with a physical disability, at her residence in Enontekiö. The living conditions were generally clean and tidy, but there were signs of disorganization and clutter in some areas. The child, a 7-year-old boy named Eero, was present during the visit and appeared to be well-nourished and healthy.

During our conversation, Ms. Kauriala reported that she has been struggling with her disability and mobility issues, which have made it challenging for her to perform daily tasks and care for Eero. She also mentioned that she has been experiencing anxiety and depression due to the added stress of caring for a child alone.

Notable concerns during the visit included:

* Ms. Kauriala's lack of access to assistive technology and adaptive equipment, which could exacerbate her mobility issues.
* The presence of unsecured sharp objects and hazardous materials in the living area, posing a risk to Eero's safety.
* Ms. Kauriala's limited social support network, which may contribute to feelings of isolation and loneliness.

Assessment:
Based on my observations and conversations with Ms. Kauriala, I assess that the situation is indeed high-risk due to the adult's physical disability and emotional state. The child's safety and well-being are compromised by the lack of adequate care and support provided by the single parent. It is essential to ensure that Eero receives the necessary care and attention to thrive in this environment.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Referral to local disability services: I will refer Ms. Kauriala to Enontekiö's Disability Services, which can provide her with access to assistive technology, adaptive equipment, and home modifications to improve her mobility.
2. Home safety assessment: A home safety assessment will be conducted to identify potential hazards and implement measures to mitigate risks to Eero's safety.
3. Social support network development: I will encourage Ms. Kauriala to participate in local social groups and support networks to help alleviate feelings of isolation and loneliness.
4. Regular follow-up visits: To ensure the child's continued well-being, regular follow-up visits will be scheduled every 6 months to assess progress and provide ongoing support.

Timeline for Further Visits:

* Next visit: 27 May 2025
* Follow-up visits: Every 6 months until further notice
