Social Services Visit Report

Date: 10.05.2025
Location: Kokkola, Finland
Visit Type: Substance Abuse Support Visit

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to assess the well-being of a cohabiting couple, Juhani and Leena Rissanen (address: Kruununhaka 14, 46100 Kokkola), who are experiencing moderate substance abuse challenges. The couple has been referred to our services due to concerns about their mental health and potential impact on their children.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, I observed Juhani and Leena in a state of distress, with visible signs of fatigue and anxiety. They reported having consumed excessive amounts of alcohol over the past week, leading to increased irritability and mood swings. The living conditions were generally tidy, but there were indications of disorganization and clutter.

During our conversation, I noted that Juhani and Leena have been struggling to manage their mental health symptoms, including depression and anxiety, in conjunction with their substance abuse issues. They expressed feelings of isolation and lack of support from family and friends. The couple's communication was strained, with frequent arguments and raised voices.

Assessment:
The assessment revealed a complex situation where Juhani and Leena are facing significant challenges in managing their mental health and substance abuse. Their cohabiting relationship is under strain, and there are concerns about the potential impact on their children. The moderate case severity indicates that while the situation is not critical, it requires ongoing support and intervention to prevent further deterioration.

Family dynamics were observed to be strained, with a lack of effective communication and conflict resolution skills. Juhani and Leena reported feeling overwhelmed and unsupported, which has exacerbated their substance abuse issues. There are concerns about the couple's ability to provide a stable and nurturing environment for their children.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
Based on this assessment, I recommend the following:

1. Referral to local mental health services: Juhani and Leena will be referred to Kokkola Mental Health Services (Kokkolan terveydenhuolto) for individual counseling sessions to address their mental health challenges.
2. Substance abuse support group: The couple will participate in a substance abuse support group at the Kokkola Community Center (Kokkolan yhteiskunnan keskus).
3. Family therapy: Regular family therapy sessions will be arranged to address communication issues and conflict resolution skills, focusing on improving the cohabiting relationship.
4. Home visit schedule: Bi-weekly home visits will be scheduled to monitor progress, provide support, and offer guidance on managing their mental health and substance abuse challenges.

Timeline for further visits:

* Follow-up assessment: 07.06.2025
