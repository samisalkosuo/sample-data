Social Services Visit Report

Date: 29 January 2025
Location: Siikalatva, Finland
Visit Type: Family Reunification Progress Check

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct a family reunification progress check on the unaccompanied minor residing in temporary housing in Siikalatva. The visit aimed to assess the current situation, risks, and family dynamics in light of the case severity.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival at the temporary housing facility, I met with the minor, Aino Salmi (age 16), who has been living there since her parents' separation last year. Aino reported feeling anxious about returning to her grandparents' home in Helsinki for a family reunification meeting scheduled for next week. She expressed concerns about adjusting to their household rules and being away from her friends.

During the visit, I observed that the temporary housing facility provided basic necessities, but the living conditions were somewhat cramped, with limited space for Aino's personal belongings. The staff reported that Aino had been struggling academically and was in need of additional support.

Aino's grandparents, who live in Helsinki, were contacted during the visit to discuss their ability to provide a stable and supportive environment for Aino upon her return. They expressed willingness to help but also mentioned concerns about managing Aino's behavior and academic performance.

Assessment:
The situation appears moderate, with some risks associated with Aino's transition back to her grandparents' home. The family dynamics seem complex, with both parents and grandparents having different expectations and rules for Aino's care. However, the grandparents' willingness to provide support and their ability to manage Aino's behavior suggest that a successful reunification is possible.

Notable concerns include Aino's anxiety about adjusting to her grandparents' household and potential difficulties in managing her academic performance. It is essential to monitor Aino's progress closely and provide additional support if needed.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Schedule regular phone calls with Aino to monitor her adjustment to the grandparents' home and address any concerns she may have.
2. Arrange for a follow-up visit within two weeks to assess Aino's progress and adjust the reunification plan as necessary.
3. Provide additional support services, such as counseling or academic tutoring, if needed to help Aino manage her behavior and academic performance.
4. Consider referring Aino to a local youth organization that can provide additional social activities and support during her stay with her grandparents.

Timeline for Further Visits:

* 26 March 2025: Reunification meeting with Aino's parents and grandparents
