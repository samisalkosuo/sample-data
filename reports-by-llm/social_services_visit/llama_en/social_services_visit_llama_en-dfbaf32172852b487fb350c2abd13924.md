Date: 19 August 2024
Location: Padasjoki, Finland
Visit Type: Domestic Violence Risk Assessment

Summary of Visit Purpose:
This visit was conducted to assess the risk of domestic violence in a two-parent household with reported neglect case in Padasjoki, Finland. The primary goal was to evaluate the family dynamics and living conditions to determine the level of risk and provide recommendations for support services.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival at the address, 12300 Padasj√§rvi, Padasjoki, the social worker observed a calm and peaceful environment. The parents, Antti and Sofia, were present during the visit and provided information about their living situation. They reported that they had been experiencing some marital tension but stated that it was not severe enough to warrant intervention.

During the conversation, Antti mentioned that he had been working long hours as an engineer and was feeling stressed, which led to some conflicts with Sofia. However, Sofia assured that she understood his stress levels and was willing to work together to find solutions. The social worker also observed that the children, Emma (10) and Lucas (7), seemed to be adjusting well to their parents' relationship dynamics.

The living conditions were found to be satisfactory, with a clean and organized home environment. However, there were some concerns regarding the availability of healthy food options and the frequency of family activities together.

Assessment:
Based on the observations during the visit, it appears that the level of risk for domestic violence is low. The parents' ability to communicate effectively and work together to resolve conflicts suggests a relatively stable relationship. However, the social worker noted that Antti's stress levels could potentially escalate if not managed properly.

The neglect case reported by the family was also assessed during the visit. Sofia mentioned that she had been struggling to balance her work as a nurse with caring for the children, leading to some instances of missed meals and activities. The social worker recommended that Sofia seek support from local parenting groups or counseling services to improve her coping mechanisms.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Referral to local parenting groups: Sofia will be referred to local parenting groups in Padasjoki to access support and guidance on managing stress and balancing work and family responsibilities.
2. Counseling for Antti: Antti may benefit from counseling sessions to address his stress levels and develop healthier coping mechanisms.
3. Regular follow-up visits: The social worker will schedule regular follow-up visits (every 6 months) to monitor the family's dynamics, living conditions, and any changes in the reported neglect case.
4. Home safety assessment: A home safety assessment will be conducted to ensure that the children are not exposed to hazardous situations or environments.
