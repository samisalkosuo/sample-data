Date: 08.06.2025
Location: Kärkölä, Finland
Visit Type: Elderly care follow-up
Household Composition: Woman recovering from domestic abuse
Case Severity: Low

Summary of Visit Purpose:
This visit was conducted as part of an ongoing elderly care follow-up for Mrs. Maria Lindström (born 1952), a 73-year-old woman who has been receiving support services following her recovery from domestic abuse in Kärkölä, Finland. The purpose of this visit was to assess the current living situation and provide guidance on maintaining her safety and well-being.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival at Mrs. Lindström's residence ( address: Salmisaari 12, 06100 Kärkölä), I observed a calm and composed individual who seemed comfortable with my presence. She provided an update on her daily routine, which included regular visits from family members and friends. The living conditions were clean and tidy, with minimal signs of distress or disorganization.

During our conversation, Mrs. Lindström expressed gratitude for the support services she has received so far, citing the emotional stability and practical assistance as invaluable resources during this challenging period. However, she also mentioned feeling isolated at times, particularly when her children are away on work or study commitments. I offered to connect her with local social groups and community organizations that cater to seniors, which she found encouraging.

Notable concerns included Mrs. Lindström's occasional anxiety attacks triggered by loud noises or unexpected visitors, for which she has been prescribed medication. She also mentioned the need for assistance with household chores, such as grocery shopping and light cleaning, due to her physical limitations.

Assessment:
Based on our conversation and observations, it appears that Mrs. Lindström is making progress in her recovery from domestic abuse. The current living situation is stable, and she has access to necessary support services. However, ongoing monitoring of her emotional state and well-being is crucial to prevent potential relapse or escalation.

Family dynamics were not a primary concern during this visit, as the family members involved are supportive and cooperative. Nevertheless, it would be beneficial to schedule future visits with family members to ensure they are aware of their roles in supporting Mrs. Lindström's recovery.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Schedule regular follow-up visits (every 6-8 weeks) to monitor Mrs. Lindström's emotional state and adjust support services as needed.
2. Arrange for occasional home visits from a social worker to provide companionship, emotional support, and practical assistance with household chores.
3. Connect Mrs. Lindström with local senior centers and community organizations that offer social activities, exercise classes, and other resources tailored to seniors.
4. Provide ongoing support and guidance on managing anxiety attacks and accessing necessary medical services.

Timeline for Further Visits:
- Next follow-up visit: 22.08.2025
- Review of progress and adjustment of support services as needed
