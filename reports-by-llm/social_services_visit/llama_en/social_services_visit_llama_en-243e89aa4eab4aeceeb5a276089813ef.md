**Social Services Visit Report**

**Visit Date:** 22.04.2025
**Location:** Espoo, Finland
**Visit Type:** Child visitation supervision report

**Summary of Visit Purpose:**
This visit was conducted as part of an ongoing child visitation supervision report for a rehabilitated ex-offender family reintegrating into society in Espoo, Finland. The primary purpose of this visit was to assess the current living conditions and interactions within the household, with a focus on ensuring the safety and well-being of the children.

**Observations During the Visit:**

Upon arrival at the address, 12300 LÃ¤nsimiehlinen, Espoo, I observed that the family was present in the living room. The rehabilitated ex-offender, Mr. Antti Kauriala, was engaged in conversation with his children, aged 8 and 10. The atmosphere appeared relaxed, but there were moments of tension when discussing past experiences related to his incarceration.

The home environment was tidy, with minimal signs of disorganization or neglect. However, I noted that the kitchen area required attention, with dirty dishes and utensils scattered about. This suggests a need for ongoing support in maintaining household cleanliness and organization.

During our conversation, Mr. Kauriala expressed concerns about his ability to provide a stable environment for his children due to past mistakes. He acknowledged the importance of seeking help and working towards rehabilitation. The children seemed receptive to their father's efforts, but occasionally displayed frustration or anxiety when discussing sensitive topics.

**Assessment:**
Given the high case severity, I assessed that this family is at risk of destabilization if not provided with adequate support and resources. While Mr. Kauriala has made progress in his rehabilitation journey, ongoing challenges related to household management and emotional regulation pose a threat to the well-being of all family members.

The children's emotional state appears stable, but their ability to cope with stressors is being tested by their father's past experiences. It is essential that Mr. Kauriala continues to engage in therapy sessions and support groups to address his emotional needs and develop effective coping strategies.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up:**

1. **Referral to Household Management Services:** Arrange for a home visit from Espoo City Council's household management team to provide guidance on maintaining a clean and organized living environment.
2. **Therapy Sessions:** Schedule regular therapy sessions for Mr. Kauriala to continue addressing his emotional needs and develop effective coping strategies.
3. **Parenting Classes:** Enroll Mr. Kauriala in parenting classes to enhance his skills in managing stressors and promoting positive family dynamics.
4. **Follow-up Visits:** Schedule bi-weekly visits to monitor the household's progress, provide ongoing support, and address any emerging concerns.

**Timeline for Further Visits:**

* 06.05.2025: Bi-weekly visit to assess household management and emotional state
* 20.05.2025: Follow-up visit to evaluate Mr. Kauriala's participation in therapy sessions and parenting classes

By providing ongoing support and resources, we can help this family overcome the challenges they face and create a more stable environment for their children to thrive.
