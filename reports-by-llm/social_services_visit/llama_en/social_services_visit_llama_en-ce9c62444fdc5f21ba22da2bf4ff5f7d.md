Social Services Visit Report

Date: 31 May 2025
Location: Eura, Finland
Visit Type: Child Welfare Check
Case Severity: Moderate

Summary of Visit Purpose:
This visit was conducted as part of an ongoing child welfare check to assess the well-being and safety of a child living with their non-custodial relative in Eura, Finland. The purpose of this visit is to evaluate the current situation, identify any potential risks or concerns, and provide support to ensure the child's needs are met.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, I observed that the child, 8-year-old Emma, was playing with her non-custodial relative, Auntia, in the living room. The atmosphere appeared relaxed, and both parties were engaged in a conversation. However, during our interaction, I noticed that Auntia seemed preoccupied and distracted, frequently checking her phone.

The living conditions of the household were satisfactory, with clean and well-maintained furniture and basic amenities. Emma's belongings were neatly arranged, indicating a sense of stability. The kitchen was tidy, but there were signs of recent meal preparation, suggesting that Auntia may be struggling to manage daily responsibilities.

Emma displayed typical childhood behaviors during our interaction, such as excitement when discussing her favorite activities and occasional frustration when unable to complete tasks. Her emotional state appeared stable, with no visible signs of distress or anxiety.

Notable Concerns:
Auntia's frequent phone checks raised concerns about potential distractions or disruptions to the child's care. Additionally, I observed that Auntia seemed hesitant to discuss Emma's daily routine, including her school schedule and extracurricular activities. This lack of transparency may indicate difficulties in managing the child's needs.

Assessment:
Based on this visit, it appears that Emma is currently living in a relatively stable environment with her non-custodial relative. However, concerns about Auntia's ability to provide consistent care and support for Emma's daily needs remain. The moderate case severity suggests that while there are some risks or challenges, they do not pose an immediate threat to the child's well-being.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Schedule a follow-up visit within 6 weeks to reassess the situation and monitor Auntia's ability to provide consistent care.
2. Refer Emma for regular counseling sessions to address any potential emotional or psychological impacts of living with a non-custodial relative.
3. Provide Auntia with resources and support to help her manage daily responsibilities, including meal planning and organization.

Timeline:
- 6 weeks: Follow-up visit to assess the situation and monitor Auntia's ability to provide consistent care.
- 12 weeks: Schedule a meeting with Emma's school to discuss her academic progress and any potential adjustments needed for her care plan.
