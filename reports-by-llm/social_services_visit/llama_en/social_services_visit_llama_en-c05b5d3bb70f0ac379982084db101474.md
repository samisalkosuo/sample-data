Social Services Visit Report

Date: 08.09.2024
Location: Ähtäri, Finland
Visit Type: Post-abuse recovery support visit

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to assess the well-being of elderly couple, Maria and Juhani Rissanen, who have been referred for post-abuse recovery support following a recent incident of domestic violence. The visit aimed to evaluate their living conditions, interactions, and emotional state to identify potential risks and provide necessary support.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, I observed that Maria and Juhani were both visibly shaken but cooperative during the interview. They reported experiencing verbal abuse by Juhani in the past few weeks, which has led to increased anxiety and sleep disturbances for Maria. The couple's living conditions are generally good, with a clean and organized home. However, there were signs of emotional distress, including unexplained bruises on Maria's arms and a noticeable decrease in her mobility.

During our conversation, Juhani appeared defensive and dismissive when questioned about the abuse, while Maria expressed feelings of isolation and helplessness. The couple's interactions were strained, with frequent arguments and raised voices. Notable concerns included Juhani's history of substance abuse and his increasing dependence on alcohol, which may be exacerbating the situation.

Assessment:
Given the high case severity, it is clear that Maria and Juhani require immediate support to ensure their safety and well-being. The couple's dynamics are complex, with a power imbalance that contributes to the abuse. Juhani's substance abuse issues further complicate the situation, as they may be enabling his behavior.

The assessment also highlights the need for emotional support and counseling for both Maria and Juhani. A safe and supportive environment is essential to facilitate their recovery and rebuild trust in each other. The risk of re-abuse is high if not addressed promptly.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
Based on my observations, I recommend the following:

1. Immediate referral to a local domestic violence support service for Maria and Juhani.
2. Counseling sessions for both partners to address underlying issues and develop healthy communication skills.
3. Assistance with accessing community resources, including transportation and household help, to alleviate stress and promote independence.
4. Regular follow-up visits to monitor progress, provide ongoing support, and adjust the intervention plan as needed.

Timeline:

* Next visit: 02 weeks from today's date
* Follow-up phone calls: bi-weekly for the next 6 months

Sign-off:
This report is based on my professional assessment of the situation. I recommend that all relevant parties take immediate action to ensure Maria and Juhani's safety and well-being.
