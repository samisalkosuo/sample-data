Social Services Visit Report

Date: 29 August 2024
Location: Paimio, Finland
Visit Type: Mental Health Monitoring Visit

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct a mental health monitoring visit for the child living with non-custodial relative, Ms. Maria Lehtonen, at her address in Paimio. The visit aimed to assess the current well-being and safety of the child, as well as evaluate the effectiveness of the support measures put in place.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, I observed that Ms. Lehtonen was welcoming and cooperative during our conversation. She reported that she had been struggling with her own mental health issues since the child's father passed away six months ago. The child, 8-year-old Emma, seemed to be adjusting well to living with Ms. Lehtonen, but occasionally expressed feelings of sadness and loneliness.

During the visit, I noticed that the living conditions were generally clean and tidy, with adequate food and basic necessities available. However, there were some signs of disorganization in the household, which may indicate a need for additional support with daily routines and organization.

Emma's behavior during the visit was generally good, but she did exhibit some anxiety when discussing her father's passing. Ms. Lehtonen reported that she had been trying to reassure Emma about her father's love and legacy, but acknowledged that it was an ongoing process.

Assessment:
Based on my observations and discussions with Ms. Lehtonen, I assess the situation as moderate in terms of risk. While there are some concerns regarding the child's emotional well-being and household organization, the overall living conditions and support measures seem adequate. However, regular monitoring and follow-up visits will be necessary to ensure that Emma continues to thrive.

Family dynamics:
Ms. Lehtonen reported that she had been trying to maintain a positive relationship with Emma's father's family, but acknowledged that it was challenging at times. She expressed a desire to involve them in Emma's life more regularly, which may require additional support and guidance from social services.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Schedule regular follow-up visits every 6-8 weeks to monitor Emma's well-being and adjust support measures as needed.
2. Refer Ms. Lehtonen to local mental health services for ongoing support with her own mental health issues.
3. Consider involving a family therapist in future visits to facilitate communication and cooperation between Ms. Lehtonen, Emma, and Emma's father's family.
4. Provide additional guidance on daily routines and organization to help the household function more smoothly.

Timeline:

* Next follow-up visit: 12 September 2024
* Referral to local mental health services: within the next two weeks
