Social Services Visit Report

Date: 15 February 2025
Location: Lappaj√§rvi, Finland
Visit Type: Newborn and Infant Safety Visit

Summary of Visit Purpose:
This visit was conducted to assess the safety and well-being of a newborn infant living with a teenage mother and her parents in their home. The visit aimed to identify potential risks and provide support to ensure a safe environment for the child.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival, I observed that the household was tidy, but there were signs of disorganization in the kitchen and living areas. The teenage mother, Ms. Aino Lehtonen, appeared anxious and overwhelmed, while her parents, Mr. and Mrs. Pekka Lehto, seemed supportive but also somewhat controlling.

During our conversation, I noted that Ms. Lehtonen was struggling to balance childcare responsibilities with school and social life. She expressed concerns about the infant's safety and her own ability to care for the child. Her parents offered assistance, but their involvement in decision-making processes raised some concerns.

The infant, a 2-month-old boy named Elias, appeared healthy and content during our interactions. However, I observed that he was often left unattended while Ms. Lehtonen attended to other tasks or socialized with her family members.

Assessment:
Based on the visit, I assessed the situation as moderate risk. While the household presented some challenges, there were also signs of support and cooperation among family members. However, the teenage mother's anxiety and lack of resources raised concerns about her ability to provide a safe environment for the child.

I noted that the parents' involvement in decision-making processes could be both beneficial and problematic, as it may undermine Ms. Lehtonen's autonomy and agency. Additionally, the household's disorganization and cluttered living areas suggested potential hazards for the infant.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Referral to local parenting support groups: I recommended that Ms. Lehtonen participate in a parenting support group to connect with other young mothers and access resources and guidance.
2. Home safety assessment: A home safety assessment will be conducted to identify potential hazards and provide recommendations for improving the infant's environment.
3. Parenting classes: I suggested that Mr. and Mrs. Lehto attend parenting classes to learn about child development, discipline, and boundary setting.
4. Follow-up visits: Regular follow-up visits will be scheduled to monitor the household's progress, address any concerns, and provide ongoing support.
