Social Services Visit Report

Date: 27 May 2025
Location: Säkylä, Finland
Visit Type: Foster family evaluation

Summary of Visit Purpose:
This visit was conducted as part of an ongoing foster family evaluation to assess the well-being and safety of the household, particularly in light of their financial difficulties. The primary goal of this visit was to evaluate the current living conditions, interactions within the household, and any potential risks or concerns that may impact the children's care.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, I observed a multi-generational household consisting of Mr. and Mrs. Kauriala (parents), their adult son, Juhani, and his two children, Aino (10) and Eero (7). The living conditions were modest, with some signs of wear and tear on the furniture and appliances. However, the overall cleanliness was satisfactory.

During the interaction, I noticed that the family members seemed to be managing their daily routines effectively, despite the financial strain. Mr. and Mrs. Kauriala appeared to be doing their best to provide for their children's needs, while Juhani showed a positive attitude towards his responsibilities as an older sibling. Aino and Eero displayed typical childhood behaviors, with Aino exhibiting some signs of anxiety related to her schoolwork.

Notable concerns included the limited availability of healthy food options, which may impact the family's nutritional well-being. Additionally, I observed that Juhani was often tasked with managing household chores, which could potentially lead to burnout or neglect of his own needs.

Assessment:
Given the low severity of this case, it is clear that the Kauriala family is doing their best to provide a stable and loving environment for their children. However, the financial difficulties pose some risks to the well-being of all household members. It is essential to continue monitoring the situation and providing support to ensure the family's needs are met.

Recommendations:
1. Regular home visits will be scheduled every 6 weeks to monitor the family's progress and provide ongoing support.
2. A referral has been made to a local food bank, which will provide assistance with purchasing healthy groceries.
3. Juhani will benefit from additional guidance on managing his household responsibilities, which may involve enlisting the help of a youth mentor or peer group.
4. The Social Services department will maintain regular contact with Mr. and Mrs. Kauriala to ensure they are receiving necessary support and resources.

Follow-up:
A follow-up visit is scheduled for 10 June 2025 to assess the family's progress in addressing their financial difficulties and implementing any recommended actions.
