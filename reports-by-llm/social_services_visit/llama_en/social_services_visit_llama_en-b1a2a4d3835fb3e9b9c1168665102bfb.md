Social Services Visit Report

Date: 08.12.2024
Location: Hirvensalmi, Finland
Visit Type: Newborn and Infant Safety Visit

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to assess the safety and well-being of a newborn infant living with their teenage mother and parents in Hirvensalmi, Finland. The visit was conducted as part of a routine new parent check-up, following concerns raised by local healthcare providers regarding potential risks to the child's safety.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, I met with the family at their residence on address 123 Koulukatu, Hirvensalmi. The teenage mother, Ms. Aino Lehtonen (20 years old), was visibly anxious and overwhelmed, while her parents, Mr. and Mrs. Pekka Lehtonen (45 and 42 years old respectively), appeared concerned but supportive. During the visit, I observed that the infant, a 2-month-old boy named Elias, was well-cared for and receiving regular feeding and diaper changes.

However, I noted some areas of concern: the living room was cluttered with toys and clothes, which posed a tripping hazard, and the kitchen lacked adequate storage for baby supplies. The mother reported feeling isolated and struggling to balance childcare responsibilities with school and social life. Her parents expressed concerns about her emotional well-being and offered support but seemed uncertain about how to provide guidance.

Assessment:
Given the case severity of moderate, I assessed that the family is facing significant challenges in managing their new responsibilities as a young parent. While the mother appears capable and caring, she requires additional support to ensure her own emotional well-being and develop effective parenting strategies. The parents' involvement is crucial, but they may benefit from guidance on how to provide emotional support and practical assistance.

Notable concerns include:

* The mother's isolation and potential for social withdrawal
* Insufficient storage and organization in the kitchen, which could lead to accidents or neglect
* The need for additional parenting education and support

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
Based on my assessment, I recommend the following next steps:

1. Referral to local parenting classes and support groups for the mother.
2. Home safety assessments and provision of storage solutions to mitigate tripping hazards.
3. Regular check-ins with the family to monitor progress and provide emotional support.
4. Collaboration with local healthcare providers to ensure comprehensive care for the infant.

Timeline:
* Follow-up visit: 6 weeks from today's date
* Additional home visits as needed
