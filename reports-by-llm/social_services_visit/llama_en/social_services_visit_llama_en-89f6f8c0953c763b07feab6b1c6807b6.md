Social Services Visit Report

Visit Date: 03.01.2025
Location: Siikalatva, Finland
Visit Type: Family Reunification Progress Check
Case Severity: Moderate

Summary of Visit Purpose:
This visit was conducted to assess the progress of the family reunification case involving siblings, Aino Laaksonen and Leena K채rkk채inen, who are sharing housing in Siikalatva. The purpose of this check is to evaluate their living situation, interactions, and overall well-being, with a focus on addressing any concerns or risks that may have arisen since the last visit.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, I observed Aino and Leena engaging in conversation while preparing breakfast together. Their interaction was generally positive, with both sisters expressing appreciation for each other's company. However, there were moments of tension when discussing household chores and financial responsibilities. The sisters seemed to be managing their differences effectively, but I noted some signs of stress and frustration.

The living conditions at the shared housing unit were satisfactory, with clean and well-maintained premises. However, I observed some clutter and disorganization in certain areas, which may indicate a need for additional support with household management.

During our conversation, Aino reported feeling overwhelmed by Leena's dominant personality and lack of consideration for her needs. Leena acknowledged these concerns but stated that she was doing her best to accommodate Aino's requirements. I also observed some signs of emotional distress in both sisters, particularly during discussions about their financial situation and future plans.

Assessment:
Based on the observations during this visit, it appears that the sisters are managing their living situation effectively, despite some challenges related to household dynamics and emotional well-being. The moderate case severity suggests that while there are concerns, they do not pose an immediate risk to the sisters' safety or well-being.

However, I believe it is essential to continue monitoring the situation and providing support to address these issues. The sisters would benefit from additional guidance on effective communication, conflict resolution, and stress management techniques. Furthermore, exploring local resources for financial assistance and counseling services could help alleviate some of the emotional distress and tension in their relationship.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Schedule a follow-up visit within 6 weeks to assess the implementation of any agreed-upon strategies and provide additional support as needed.
2. Refer Aino and Leena to local counseling services specializing in conflict resolution and stress management, with a focus on improving their communication skills.
3. Explore local resources for financial assistance, such as government subsidies or non-profit organizations providing aid to low-income families.
4. Consider conducting a home visit to assess the sisters' ability to manage household chores and responsibilities effectively.

Timeline:
- Follow-up visit: 03.15.2025
- Referral to counseling services: within the next 2 weeks
- Exploration of local financial assistance resources: ongoing

Conclusion:
This visit provided valuable insights into the living situation and dynamics of Aino Laaksonen and Leena K채rkk채inen. While there are concerns related to household management, emotional well-being, and communication, I am confident that with continued support and guidance, they can work towards a more stable and fulfilling relationship.
