Social Services Visit Report

Date: 26 December 2024
Location: Utajärvi, Finland
Visit Type: Domestic Violence Risk Assessment

Summary of Visit Purpose:
This visit was conducted to assess the risk of domestic violence in a transitional housing setting for residents post-rehabilitation. The purpose of this assessment is to identify potential risks and provide support to ensure a safe living environment.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival, I met with Ms. Aino Kärkkäinen, a 35-year-old resident of the transitional housing facility. She reported that she had been experiencing some tension with her partner, Mr. Eero Lappi, but stated that it was not severe and they were working on their issues. However, during our conversation, I observed that Ms. Kärkkäinen seemed anxious and hesitant to discuss her feelings further.

The living conditions of the facility were satisfactory, with clean and well-maintained common areas and private rooms. However, there were some concerns regarding the lack of storage space for residents' personal belongings, which could potentially lead to clutter and stress.

Ms. Kärkkäinen's partner, Mr. Lappi, was not present during our visit, but I observed that he seemed distant and uninterested in engaging with Ms. Kärkkäinen. This behavior raised concerns about his level of involvement in the relationship and potential red flags for domestic violence.

Assessment:
Based on my observations and discussions with Ms. Kärkkäinen, I assess the situation as low-risk at this time. However, it is essential to continue monitoring the situation and providing support to ensure that both parties are working towards a healthy and safe coexistence. The lack of storage space and clutter in the common areas may exacerbate stress levels, which could potentially impact the relationship.

Family dynamics:
Ms. Kärkkäinen reported that she and Mr. Lappi have been together for five years and have two children together. They seem to be working on their issues, but there is still a sense of tension between them. I observed that Ms. Kärkkäinen's children were present during our visit and seemed to be adjusting well to the situation.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Continue regular check-ins with Ms. Kärkkäinen to monitor her well-being and provide support.
2. Refer Mr. Lappi for counseling sessions to address his behavior and improve communication skills.
3. Provide additional resources and support for managing stress and clutter in the common areas.
4. Schedule a follow-up visit within six weeks to reassess the situation and provide further guidance.
