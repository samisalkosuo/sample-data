Social Services Visit Report

Date: 25.12.2024
Location: Taivassalo, Finland
Visit Type: Safety Plan Monitoring Visit

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to monitor the safety plan implemented following recent custody changes in a blended family with multiple children. The social services team aimed to assess the current living situation, interactions among family members, and any potential risks or concerns that may have arisen since the last visit.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival at the residence located at Kirjaportti 12, Taivassalo, I observed a tense atmosphere within the household. The parents, Juhani and Leena, were present, along with their three children (ages 10, 7, and 4). The children appeared to be on edge, with visible signs of anxiety and stress. During our conversation, Juhani expressed concerns about the recent custody changes and how they have affected his relationship with his children.

Leena seemed overwhelmed, struggling to manage her emotions and maintain a sense of control in the household. The children's behavior was erratic, with frequent outbursts and difficulty adhering to the agreed-upon safety plan. I noted that the children were having trouble sleeping due to nightmares related to the custody changes.

Assessment:
Given the moderate case severity, it is clear that the family is facing significant challenges in adapting to the recent custody changes. The tension within the household is palpable, and the parents' ability to manage their emotions and provide a stable environment for their children is compromised. The safety plan implemented by social services appears to be struggling to address these issues.

Notable concerns include:

* Leena's emotional state: Her struggles with anxiety and stress are affecting her ability to care for herself and her children.
* Juhani's behavior: His frustration and anger towards the custody changes may lead to further conflict and undermine his role as a parent.
* Children's well-being: The children's nightmares and erratic behavior indicate that they require additional support to cope with the recent changes.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Referral for Family Therapy: I recommend that Juhani, Leena, and their children attend family therapy sessions to address the emotional challenges and develop strategies for managing stress and conflict.
2. Parenting Support Services: Leena would benefit from individual parenting support services to help her cope with anxiety and improve her ability to care for herself and her children.
3. Child-Centered Therapy: The children require child-centered therapy to address their nightmares and develop coping mechanisms for dealing with the recent custody changes.
4. Follow-up Visits: I propose scheduling regular follow-up visits (every 6 weeks) to monitor progress, provide additional support as needed, and adjust the safety plan accordingly.

Timeline:

* Family Therapy Sessions: Schedule bi-weekly sessions starting from January 15th, 2025
* Parenting Support Services: Arrange for Leena's individual therapy sessions starting from January 20th, 2025
* Child-Centered Therapy: Schedule regular sessions with a child psychologist starting from January 22nd, 2025

By implementing these recommendations and providing ongoing support, we can help this family navigate the challenges posed by recent custody changes and work towards creating a safer and more stable environment for all members.
