Social Services Visit Report

Date: 16 February 2025
Location: Haapavesi, Finland
Visit Type: Foster family evaluation

Summary of Visit Purpose:
This visit was conducted as part of an ongoing foster family evaluation to assess the well-being and safety of the child living with their non-custodial relative in Haapavesi. The purpose of this visit was to evaluate the current situation, identify any concerns or risks, and provide recommendations for support and services to ensure the best possible outcomes for the child.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival at the residence, I observed a calm and peaceful environment. The non-custodial relative, Ms. Leena Kärkkäinen, welcomed me warmly and provided information about the child's daily routine and activities. The child, 8-year-old Aino Kärkkäinen, was present during the visit and appeared to be generally happy and engaged.

During our conversation, I noted that Ms. Kärkkäinen reported difficulties in managing Aino's behavior, particularly with regards to screen time and homework completion. She also expressed concerns about Aino's social interactions with other children at school, citing difficulties in making friends. However, it was clear that Ms. Kärkkäinen is committed to providing a stable and loving environment for Aino.

I observed that the residence is well-maintained, with clean living areas and adequate storage space. The kitchen is equipped with basic cooking utensils, and there are sufficient provisions of food and household essentials. However, I noted that the child's bedroom could benefit from some organization and decluttering to promote a sense of calm and focus.

Assessment:
Based on my observations during this visit, I assess the situation as moderate in terms of risk. While Ms. Kärkkäinen is doing her best to provide for Aino's needs, there are some concerns that require attention. The child's behavior management and social interactions with peers are areas that require additional support.

I also noted that Ms. Kärkkäinen could benefit from some respite care or adult supervision during the afternoons, as she reported feeling overwhelmed by the demands of caring for Aino alone. Additionally, I recommended that Ms. Kärkkäinen consider seeking professional guidance on managing Aino's behavior and developing strategies to promote social interactions.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
Based on my assessment, I recommend the following:

1. Referral to a child psychologist for individual therapy sessions with Aino to address behavioral challenges and develop coping strategies.
2. Collaboration with the school to identify potential support services for Aino, such as counseling or peer mentoring programs.
3. Regular respite care arrangements to provide Ms. Kärkkäinen with adult supervision during afternoons.
4. Ongoing home visits to monitor progress, provide guidance, and offer support.

Timeline:
I propose a follow-up visit in six weeks to assess the effectiveness of these recommendations and make any necessary adjustments.

Conclusion:
This visit provided valuable insights into the current situation and identified areas that require attention. I am confident that with the right support and services, Aino can thrive in her current environment.
