Social Services Visit Report

Date: 24.10.2024
Location: Enonkoski, Finland
Visit Type: Safety Plan Monitoring Visit

Summary of Visit Purpose:
This visit was conducted to monitor the safety plan implemented for Ms. Maria Lehtonen, a woman recovering from domestic abuse, in accordance with her urgent case severity. The purpose of this visit is to assess the effectiveness of the safety plan, identify any potential risks or concerns, and provide support to ensure her continued well-being.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival at Ms. Lehtonen's residence, I observed that she was visibly anxious and on edge. She reported feeling increasingly isolated and dependent on her partner for basic needs, despite having a safety plan in place. The living conditions were satisfactory, with minimal signs of domestic violence or abuse. However, I noted some inconsistencies in the household chores and responsibilities, which may indicate ongoing power imbalance.

During our conversation, Ms. Lehtonen expressed concerns about her partner's behavior, stating that he had become increasingly controlling and dismissive of her feelings. She reported feeling trapped and unsure of how to escape the situation. Her emotional state was characterized by anxiety, fear, and a sense of hopelessness.

Notable Concerns:
The primary concern during this visit was Ms. Lehtonen's continued vulnerability to abuse and exploitation. Despite having a safety plan in place, she seemed uncertain about her ability to leave the relationship or access support services. The power imbalance within the household remained a significant risk factor, and I expressed concerns that her partner may be attempting to undermine her efforts to escape.

Assessment:
The assessment of Ms. Lehtonen's situation suggests that she requires ongoing support and monitoring to ensure her safety and well-being. The safety plan implemented during our previous visits appears to be effective in providing a basic level of protection, but it is essential to continue assessing the risks and dynamics within the household. I recommend increasing the frequency of visits to provide more timely support and intervention.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Increase visit frequency: Schedule bi-weekly visits for the next three months to monitor Ms. Lehtonen's situation and provide ongoing support.
2. Referral to counseling services: Arrange for Ms. Lehtonen to receive individual counseling sessions to address her emotional trauma and develop coping strategies.
3. Support group participation: Enroll Ms. Lehtonen in a local support group for survivors of domestic abuse, which will provide her with a safe space to share her experiences and connect with others who have faced similar challenges.
4. Safety plan revision: Collaborate with Ms. Lehtonen to revise and update her safety plan, incorporating new strategies and resources to enhance her protection and empowerment.

Timeline:
- Bi-weekly visits for the next three months
- Individual counseling sessions (start within two weeks)
- Support group participation (schedule within four weeks)

Next Steps:
I will schedule a follow-up visit in two weeks to assess Ms. Lehtonen's progress, provide ongoing support, and address any emerging concerns or challenges.
