Date: 01.04.2025
Location: Leppävirta, Finland
Visit Type: Elderly care follow-up
Household Composition: Disabled adult (Mr. Juhani Kärkkäinen) and live-in caregiver (Ms. Maria Lindström)
Case Severity: Low

Summary of Visit Purpose:
This visit was conducted as a follow-up to the initial elderly care assessment, aimed at evaluating the current living situation and well-being of Mr. Kärkkäinen and Ms. Lindström. The purpose of this visit was to assess the effectiveness of the support services provided and identify any potential concerns or areas for improvement.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, I observed that the household was clean and tidy, with a warm and welcoming atmosphere. Mr. Kärkkäinen was seated in his favorite armchair, watching TV, while Ms. Lindström was preparing lunch in the kitchen. They both greeted me warmly and were eager to discuss their current situation.

During our conversation, I noted that Mr. Kärkkäinen's disability had not significantly impacted his daily activities, thanks to Ms. Lindström's dedicated care. However, he expressed occasional feelings of loneliness and isolation, which they attributed to limited social interactions outside the household. Ms. Lindström reported that she was doing her best to maintain a balanced routine, but sometimes struggled with managing Mr. Kärkkäinen's medication schedule.

Notable concerns included Mr. Kärkkäinen's tendency to forget appointments and events, which could lead to feelings of anxiety and frustration. Additionally, Ms. Lindström mentioned that she was experiencing physical strain due to the demands of caregiving, particularly in terms of lifting and transferring Mr. Kärkkäinen.

Assessment:
Based on our conversation and observations, I assessed the situation as low-risk, with no immediate concerns for the safety or well-being of either household member. However, it is essential to continue monitoring their situation and providing support to address potential long-term effects of caregiving strain and social isolation.

Family dynamics were observed to be positive, with a strong bond between Mr. Kärkkäinen and Ms. Lindström. They expressed gratitude for the support services provided by our agency and acknowledged the importance of ongoing care and attention.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
1. Schedule regular check-ins (every 3 months) to monitor Mr. Kärkkäinen's medication schedule and provide guidance on managing his disability.
2. Arrange for occasional social visits from local senior centers or community groups to help alleviate feelings of loneliness and isolation.
3. Provide Ms. Lindström with resources and support for managing her physical strain, including referrals to local healthcare services and home care assistance programs.
4. Offer ongoing counseling sessions (every 6 months) to address Mr. Kärkkäinen's anxiety and frustration related to his disability.
