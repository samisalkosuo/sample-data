Date: 26 June 2025

Location: Polvij채rvi, Finland

Visit Type: Routine family wellbeing visit

Case Information:
Client Name: Leena Kauriala
Address: Kyl채ntie 12, 75500 Polvij채rvi, Finland
Case Severity: Moderate

Summary of Visit Purpose:
This routine family wellbeing visit was conducted to assess the current situation and provide support to Leena Kauriala, a woman recovering from domestic abuse. The visit aimed to evaluate her living conditions, interactions with family members, and overall wellbeing.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival, Leena appeared nervous but cooperative during the initial conversation. She reported feeling safe in her home, thanks to the support of local social services and her partner, Juhani. However, she expressed concerns about maintaining a sense of normalcy in their daily lives, given the traumatic events she experienced.

The living conditions at Kyl채ntie 12 were found to be satisfactory, with basic amenities and minimal signs of distress. Leena's partner, Juhani, was present during the visit and appeared supportive, although he seemed hesitant to discuss his own feelings about the situation.

Leena reported engaging in self-care activities, such as yoga and reading, to cope with her emotions. She also mentioned attending local support groups for survivors of domestic abuse, which provided her with a sense of community and understanding.

Notable concerns included Leena's occasional flashbacks and nightmares, which she attributed to the stress of daily life. Juhani reported feeling overwhelmed by his own emotions and struggles to provide emotional support to Leena.

Assessment:
The situation appears moderate in terms of risk, as Leena has access to necessary support services and her partner is supportive. However, ongoing therapy sessions and regular check-ins with social services are crucial to ensure Leena's continued recovery and well-being.

Family dynamics suggest a positive relationship between Leena and Juhani, but it is essential to monitor their interactions and provide guidance on healthy communication and conflict resolution strategies.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Schedule bi-weekly therapy sessions for Leena to continue addressing her trauma and emotional distress.
2. Arrange regular check-ins with social services to monitor Leena's progress and adjust support as needed.
3. Provide Juhani with resources and guidance on supporting his partner, including counseling and communication skills training.
4. Offer ongoing support and referrals to local community organizations that cater to survivors of domestic abuse.

Timeline for Follow-up Visits:

* Next visit: 10 August 2025
* Follow-up visits will be scheduled every two weeks until Leena's case is closed.
