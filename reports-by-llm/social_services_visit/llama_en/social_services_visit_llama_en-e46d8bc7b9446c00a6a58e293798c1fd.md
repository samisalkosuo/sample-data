Social Services Visit Report

Date: 06.03.2025
Location: Jomala, Finland
Visit Type: Unaccompanied Minor Intake Assessment

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct an intake assessment for the unaccompanied minor residing in Jomala, Finland. The single father, Mr. Antti Lehtonen, had reported concerns about his 12-year-old daughter's well-being and sought assistance from social services.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival at the residence, located at Kauppatorget 14, Jomala, I was greeted by Mr. Lehtonen, who appeared anxious and concerned about his daughter's situation. The living conditions were satisfactory, with a clean and tidy home environment. However, there were signs of financial strain, including limited food options and worn-out furniture.

During the assessment, the 12-year-old daughter, Aino Lehtonen, was cooperative but seemed hesitant to discuss her feelings or concerns. Mr. Lehtonen reported that she had been struggling in school due to bullying and lack of social interaction outside of home. He expressed his concern for her emotional well-being and ability to cope with daily life.

Assessment:
Based on the information gathered during the visit, it appears that the family is facing significant challenges, primarily related to financial strain and social isolation. While the living conditions are satisfactory, the father's anxiety and concerns about his daughter's well-being are evident. The case severity is classified as low due to the absence of severe neglect or abuse.

Notable concerns include:

* Limited access to resources and support services for single parents
* Aino's struggles in school and social isolation
* Financial strain on the family, potentially affecting their ability to provide basic necessities

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
Based on the assessment, I recommend the following next steps:

1. Referral to local schools and educational authorities to address bullying and support Aino's academic development.
2. Connection with a local youth organization to provide social activities and support for Aino outside of home.
3. Assistance from a financial advisor to explore options for improving the family's economic situation.
4. Regular follow-up visits to monitor the family's progress, provide emotional support, and address any emerging concerns.

Timeline:

* Within the next two weeks: Arrange meetings with local schools and educational authorities to discuss Aino's case and develop a plan for her academic support.
* Within the next four weeks: Establish contact with a local youth organization to provide social activities and support for Aino.
* Ongoing: Regular follow-up visits to monitor the family's progress, provide emotional support, and address any emerging concerns.
