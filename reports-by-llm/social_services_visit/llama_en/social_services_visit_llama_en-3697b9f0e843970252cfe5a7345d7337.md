Social Services Visit Report

Date: 23 February 2025
Location: Koski Tl, Finland
Visit Type: Unaccompanied Minor Intake Assessment

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct an intake assessment for an unaccompanied minor due to concerns regarding the well-being and safety of the child within a household where a parent has a substance use disorder. The high case severity level necessitated immediate attention to ensure the child's needs are met.

Observations During the Visit:
Upon arrival, I observed a parent, Ms. Aino Luukkainen (age 35), who appeared disheveled and lethargic. She was accompanied by two children, a 10-year-old son named Elias and an 8-year-old daughter named Linnéa. The living conditions were modest, with some signs of neglect evident in the state of the kitchen and bathroom areas.

During our conversation, Ms. Luukkainen expressed difficulty in managing her substance use disorder, which has led to increased stress and anxiety within the household. She acknowledged that she struggles to provide a stable environment for her children, often relying on them to care for themselves during her periods of intoxication.

Elias and Linnéa displayed signs of emotional distress, with Elias exhibiting avoidance behaviors and Linnéa displaying anxious tendencies. Both children reported feeling responsible for their mother's actions and expressed concerns about their own well-being.

Assessment:
The assessment revealed a high level of risk to the child's physical and emotional safety due to the parent's substance use disorder. The household dynamics are characterized by neglect, anxiety, and stress, which can have long-term consequences on the children's mental health and development.

Family dynamics are strained, with Ms. Luukkainen struggling to establish a stable routine or provide consistent care for her children. Elias and Linnéa require additional support to address their emotional needs, including counseling and respite services.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:
Based on this assessment, I recommend the following:

1. Immediate referral to local substance abuse treatment services for Ms. Luukkainen to address her addiction.
2. Enrollment of Elias and Linnéa in a child-focused counseling program to address their emotional distress and develop coping strategies.
3. Arrangement of regular respite care for the children, providing them with temporary relief from their caregiving responsibilities.
4. Collaboration with local social services to establish a long-term support plan, including ongoing assessments and case management.

Timeline:
- Within the next 48 hours: Arrange for Ms. Luukkainen to begin substance abuse treatment and enroll Elias and Linnéa in counseling.
- Within the next 2 weeks: Schedule regular respite care sessions for the children.
- Ongoing: Conduct bi-weekly assessments of the household's dynamics and adjust the support plan as necessary.

This report will be reviewed and updated regularly to ensure the well-being and safety of Elias, Linnéa, and Ms. Luukkainen are prioritized.
