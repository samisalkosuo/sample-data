Social Services Visit Report

Date: 11.05.2025
Location: Paimio, Finland
Visit Type: Parental capacity evaluation
Case Severity: Moderate

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct a parental capacity evaluation for the young adult resident at the address provided. The referral was made due to concerns regarding the individual's ability to provide adequate care and support for themselves, as well as potential risks to their own well-being.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival, I observed that the young adult, Ms. Aino Luukkainen, was living alone in a modest apartment. The premises were clean and tidy, with minimal signs of disorganization or clutter. Ms. Luukkainen appeared relaxed and calm during our conversation, but seemed somewhat hesitant to discuss her daily routines and living arrangements.

During the interview, I noted that Ms. Luukkainen reported having limited social interactions outside of work and online communities. She also mentioned experiencing occasional anxiety and depression, which she manages with self-care practices such as meditation and exercise. However, she expressed concerns about feeling isolated and lacking a sense of purpose in her life.

Notable concerns during the visit included Ms. Luukkainen's reported difficulties with managing household chores and maintaining a regular routine. She also mentioned having trouble accessing local healthcare services due to language barriers and limited mobility.

Assessment:
Based on the observations and information gathered during the visit, it appears that Ms. Luukkainen is facing challenges in maintaining her independence and overall well-being. While she has made efforts to manage her mental health, there are concerns regarding her ability to provide adequate care for herself, particularly in terms of daily living skills and access to essential services.

The moderate case severity suggests that while the situation requires attention, it does not pose an immediate risk to Ms. Luukkainen's safety or well-being. However, regular monitoring and support are necessary to ensure her continued stability and independence.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Referral to local healthcare services for language support and mental health counseling.
2. Assistance with accessing community resources and social activities to combat isolation.
3. Regular home visits to monitor Ms. Luukkainen's living conditions and provide guidance on household management.
4. Consideration of a temporary financial assistance package to alleviate some of the burden of daily expenses.

Timeline for Follow-up Visits:
- 6 weeks: Initial follow-up visit to assess progress, provide support, and adjust recommendations as needed.
- 12 weeks: Second follow-up visit to evaluate continued stability and independence.
- 24 weeks: Final assessment of long-term needs and potential next steps.
