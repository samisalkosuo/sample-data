Social Services Visit Report

Date: 24.10.2024
Location: Uusikaupunki, Finland
Visit Type: Newborn and Infant Safety Visit

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to assess the safety and well-being of the newborn child in a blended family setting with recent custody changes. The high case severity level necessitated a thorough evaluation of the household's dynamics, living conditions, and potential risks to the infant.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival at the residence located at Kauppakatu 12, Uusikaupunki, I was greeted by the mother, Ms. Leena Kauriala, who appeared visibly distressed. She reported that she had recently been granted custody of her child following a contentious divorce from her ex-partner, Mr. Antti Salmi. The father's whereabouts were uncertain, and he had not been in contact with the family for several weeks.

During the visit, I observed that the living conditions were satisfactory, with adequate space and basic amenities available. However, the mother's emotional state was evident, with signs of anxiety and stress apparent on her face. She reported feeling overwhelmed by the responsibilities of caring for a newborn child alone and struggling to cope with the recent custody changes.

Notable concerns included:

* The mother's lack of support from her ex-partner, which had led to feelings of isolation and vulnerability.
* The presence of unsecured firearms in the residence, which posed a risk to the infant.
* The mother's self-reported history of substance abuse, which could impact her ability to provide a safe environment for her child.

Assessment:
The assessment revealed a high-risk situation due to the mother's emotional state, lack of support from her ex-partner, and potential exposure to firearms. The recent custody changes had created significant stress and uncertainty, which could compromise the infant's safety and well-being.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Immediate Referral: I referred Ms. Kauriala to a local domestic violence support service (SOS-keskus) for counseling and emotional support.
2. Firearms Safety Assessment: A firearms safety assessment will be conducted at the mother's earliest convenience to determine the feasibility of removing the firearms from the residence.
3. Infant Visitation Schedule: I recommended establishing a regular infant visitation schedule with a trusted family member or friend to provide additional support and supervision.
4. Case Management: The case will be reviewed in two weeks to assess progress, address any emerging concerns, and adjust the plan as necessary.
