Social Services Visit Report

Date: 22 June 2025
Location: Eckerö, Finland
Visit Type: Domestic Violence Risk Assessment

Summary of Visit Purpose:
This visit was conducted to assess the risk of domestic violence in the household of a teenager with school attendance issues. The purpose of this assessment is to identify potential risks and provide support to ensure the safety and well-being of all family members.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival, I met with the teenager, whose name is Aino Lehtonen, at her family's residence in Eckerö. Aino appeared anxious and hesitant during our conversation, but was open about her struggles with school attendance and feelings of isolation within the household. Her parents, Mr. and Mrs. Lehtonen, were present during the visit, although they did not engage in a significant amount of conversation.

The living conditions at the residence were generally satisfactory, with adequate space for all family members. However, there were signs of clutter and disorganization, which may indicate a lack of structure or routine within the household. Aino mentioned that she often feels overwhelmed by her schoolwork and struggles to complete assignments on time.

During our conversation, I observed that Aino's parents seemed to be in a state of tension, with Mr. Lehtonen appearing frustrated and Mrs. Lehtonen seeming anxious. However, they did not exhibit any overt signs of physical or emotional abuse during the visit.

Assessment:
Based on my observations and Aino's account, it appears that there is a low level of risk associated with domestic violence in this household. While tensions between Mr. and Mrs. Lehtonen were evident, they did not seem to be related to any form of abuse or neglect. However, the lack of structure and routine within the household may contribute to Aino's feelings of isolation and frustration.

It is essential to continue monitoring the situation and providing support to Aino to ensure her well-being and academic success. Regular follow-up visits will be necessary to assess the family dynamics and provide guidance on managing stress and improving communication.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Schedule regular follow-up visits with Aino every 6-8 weeks to monitor her progress and provide ongoing support.
2. Refer Aino to a local school counselor to address her attendance issues and develop strategies for improved academic performance.
3. Provide the Lehtonen family with information on local resources and support services, including counseling and parenting classes, to help them manage stress and improve communication.
4. Consider conducting additional assessments or home visits in the future if there are any changes in Aino's situation or if concerns about domestic violence arise.

Timeline for Follow-up Visits:

* 6-8 weeks from today: First follow-up visit with Aino
* 12-14 weeks from today: Second follow-up visit with Aino and family
* 18-20 weeks from today: Third follow-up visit with Aino and family
