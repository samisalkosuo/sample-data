Social Services Visit Report

Date: 02.07.2025
Location: Lieto, Finland
Visit Type: Domestic Violence Risk Assessment

Summary of Visit Purpose:
This visit was conducted to assess the risk of domestic violence in a household with an unaccompanied minor residing in temporary housing. The purpose of this assessment is to identify potential risks and provide support to ensure the safety and well-being of the child.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival, I met with the mother, Ms. Aino Lehtonen, who resides at the address 123 Kruununhaka Street, Lieto, Finland. The unaccompanied minor, a 14-year-old girl named Sofia, was present during our conversation. Ms. Lehtonen appeared anxious and tearful, while Sofia seemed hesitant to engage in conversation.

During our discussion, it became clear that the couple has been experiencing marital difficulties for several months. Ms. Lehtonen reported instances of verbal aggression, emotional manipulation, and physical intimidation by her partner. However, she also acknowledged that these incidents have decreased in frequency since their last visit with social services.

Notable concerns during the visit included Sofia's reluctance to discuss her feelings or experiences related to the domestic violence. She appeared fearful of speaking out about the situation, which may indicate a lack of trust in authorities or a fear of retaliation from her parents.

Assessment:
Based on our conversation and observations, I assessed the situation as moderate risk for domestic violence. While Ms. Lehtonen reported a decrease in incidents since their last visit, the ongoing tension and emotional distress within the household remain a concern. The fact that Sofia is hesitant to discuss her experiences further suggests that she may be vulnerable to further exploitation or harm.

Family dynamics appear strained, with both parents displaying controlling behavior towards each other and Sofia. This dynamic can create an environment where children feel trapped and unable to escape abusive situations.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Referral to local domestic violence support services for Ms. Lehtonen and Sofia.
2. Arrangement of a follow-up visit within the next two weeks to assess progress and provide ongoing support.
3. Collaboration with the Finnish Child Welfare Authority to ensure that Sofia's needs are being met and her safety is prioritized.
4. Consideration of temporary relocation to a safe housing unit, pending further assessment and planning.

Timeline for Further Visits:

* 02.21.2025: Follow-up visit to assess progress and provide ongoing support
* 03.07.2025: Re-evaluation of the situation and potential relocation options
