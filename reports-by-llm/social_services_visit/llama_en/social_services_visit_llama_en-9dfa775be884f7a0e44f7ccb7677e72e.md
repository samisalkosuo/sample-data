Social Services Visit Report

Date: 25.10.2024
Location: Kannus, Finland
Visit Type: Youth mentoring program assessment

Summary of Visit Purpose:
This visit was conducted as part of an ongoing youth mentoring program assessment for a teenager with school attendance issues in Kannus, Finland. The purpose of the visit was to evaluate the current situation, assess potential risks, and provide recommendations for support services.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival at the residence located at Koulukatu 12, 60200 Kannus, I met with the teenager, Aku Suominen, who is a 16-year-old male. Aku's mother was also present during the visit. The living conditions were satisfactory, with clean and well-maintained furniture. However, there were signs of disorganization in the kitchen and dining area.

During our conversation, Aku expressed difficulties with school attendance due to lack of motivation and peer pressure from friends. He mentioned that he had been struggling to complete his homework and participate in class activities. His mother reported that Aku's grades have been below average for several months, which has caused concern among the teachers.

Aku's emotional state appeared to be stable during the visit, but he did exhibit some frustration when discussing his school issues. His mother seemed supportive and willing to work with the mentoring program to help Aku overcome his challenges.

Assessment:
Based on the observations and discussions during the visit, it appears that Aku is facing difficulties with school attendance due to internal and external factors. The case severity is classified as low, indicating that while there are concerns, they do not pose an immediate risk to Aku's well-being or safety.

The family dynamics seem to be supportive, with both parents willing to work together to address Aku's challenges. However, it is essential to monitor the situation closely and provide ongoing support to ensure Aku stays on track with his education.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Continue regular mentoring sessions with Aku to help him develop strategies for improving his school attendance and motivation.
2. Refer Aku to a guidance counselor at his school to discuss individualized support plans and address any underlying issues that may be contributing to his difficulties.
3. Schedule follow-up visits every 6 weeks to monitor Aku's progress and adjust the mentoring program as needed.
4. Provide resources for Aku's mother, including counseling services or support groups, to help her cope with the challenges of supporting a child with school attendance issues.

Timeline:

* Next visit: 15.11.2024
* Follow-up visits: Every 6 weeks until the end of the academic year (June 2025)
