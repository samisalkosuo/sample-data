Social Services Visit Report

Date: 13 May 2025
Location: Eckerö, Finland
Visit Type: Emergency Housing Verification
Case Number: ES-1234

Summary of Visit Purpose:
This emergency housing verification visit was conducted to assess the living conditions and well-being of a single father with his child in Eckerö, Finland. The purpose of this visit is to verify the family's housing situation and identify any potential risks or concerns that may require further support.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival at the address, 123 Kustavinkatu, Eckerö, I was greeted by the single father, Mr. Juhani Lehtonen, who appeared anxious and concerned about his child's well-being. The child, a 7-year-old boy named Elias, seemed hesitant to interact with me but was cooperative during the assessment.

The living conditions at the address were found to be satisfactory, with adequate heating, lighting, and sanitation facilities. However, there were some concerns regarding the cleanliness of the premises, particularly in the kitchen area. Mr. Lehtonen acknowledged that he had been struggling to maintain a clean environment due to his limited financial resources.

During our conversation, I observed that Mr. Lehtonen was open about his struggles with managing his finances and finding employment opportunities in Eckerö. He expressed concerns about providing for his child's needs and ensuring their safety and well-being.

Assessment:
Based on the observations during the visit, it appears that the family is facing some challenges related to financial stability and access to resources. However, the overall living conditions are satisfactory, and there are no immediate concerns regarding the child's physical or emotional well-being.

The case severity is classified as low due to the absence of any significant risks or threats to the child's safety or well-being. Nevertheless, it is essential to continue monitoring the family's situation and providing support to ensure their long-term stability and resilience.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Referral to local employment services: I will refer Mr. Lehtonen to the Eckerö Employment Office to explore available job opportunities and provide guidance on resume-building and interview skills.
2. Assistance with household management: The Social Services department will offer support to help Mr. Lehtonen develop a cleaning schedule and provide resources for managing his finances more effectively.
3. Regular check-ins: I will schedule regular follow-up visits (every 6 months) to monitor the family's progress, provide ongoing support, and address any emerging concerns.

Timeline:

* Next follow-up visit: 13 November 2025
* Referral to employment services: within the next two weeks
