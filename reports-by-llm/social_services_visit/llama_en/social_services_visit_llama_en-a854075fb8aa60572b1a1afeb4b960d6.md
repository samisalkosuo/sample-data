Social Services Visit Report

Date: 27 September 2024
Location: Vaala, Finland
Visit Type: Mental Health Monitoring Visit
Case Severity: High

Summary of Visit Purpose:
This visit was conducted to monitor the well-being of the family at address 123 Kyl√§ntie, Vaala, in light of a reported neglect case. The primary objective is to assess the current situation and provide support to ensure the safety and welfare of all family members.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival, I observed that the household was tidy, with no visible signs of neglect or abuse. However, during our conversation, it became apparent that the parents, Antti and Leena, were struggling to manage their mental health. They reported feeling overwhelmed and isolated, which has led to a decline in their relationship.

The children, aged 8 and 10, appeared to be coping with the situation, but showed signs of anxiety and stress. They were hesitant to discuss their feelings, but seemed to be relying on each other for emotional support. The parents acknowledged that they have been having trouble sleeping and experiencing mood swings, which has made it challenging to care for themselves, let alone their children.

Assessment:
The assessment suggests that the family is at high risk due to the reported neglect case. While the current living conditions do not appear to be hazardous, the mental health concerns pose a significant threat to the well-being of all family members. The parents' inability to manage their emotions and provide adequate care for themselves and their children creates an environment where neglect can escalate.

Family dynamics are strained, with the parents experiencing marital conflict and feeling isolated from their community. The children are struggling to cope with the situation, and it is essential that they receive support to address their emotional needs.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Referral to Mental Health Services: I will refer Antti and Leena to a mental health professional for individual counseling sessions to address their mental health concerns.
2. Family Therapy Sessions: Regular family therapy sessions will be arranged to help the parents work through their relationship issues and develop strategies to manage their emotions.
3. Support Groups: The children will be encouraged to participate in support groups specifically designed for children affected by parental mental health issues.
4. Home Visits: Regular home visits will be scheduled to monitor the family's progress, provide emotional support, and ensure that their basic needs are being met.
5. Follow-up Visit: A follow-up visit is scheduled for 6 weeks from today to assess the family's progress and adjust the support plan as necessary.

Timeline:

* 6 weeks from today: Follow-up visit to assess progress
* 3 months from today: Review of mental health treatment plans and adjustment of support services as needed
