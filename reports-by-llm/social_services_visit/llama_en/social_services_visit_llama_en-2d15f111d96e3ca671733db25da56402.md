Social Services Visit Report

Date: 19 March 2025
Location: Konnevesi, Finland
Visit Type: Disability Support Assessment

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct a disability support assessment for the refugee family residing in temporary accommodation at the address provided. The assessment aimed to evaluate the family's needs and provide recommendations for potential support services.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival, I met with Mr. Ali Hassan, the father, and his wife, Mrs. Amira Hassan, along with their two children, Aisha (12) and Javed (9). The family was welcoming and cooperative during the visit. The living conditions were satisfactory, with basic amenities provided by the temporary accommodation provider.

During our conversation, Mr. Hassan mentioned that Aisha has been experiencing difficulties with her vision due to an undiagnosed condition. He expressed concerns about her future education and employment prospects. Mrs. Hassan reported that Javed has been struggling with anxiety and behavioral issues, which have led to difficulties in his daily life.

The children's emotional state was evident during the visit, with Aisha appearing anxious and withdrawn at times, while Javed displayed restless behavior. The family's overall well-being seemed to be affected by their living situation and lack of access to specialized support services for their disabilities.

Assessment:
Given the low case severity, it is essential to acknowledge that the family is currently coping with their circumstances. However, the presence of undiagnosed vision issues in Aisha and Javed's anxiety-related behavioral issues necessitate further evaluation and support.

The family's living situation, while satisfactory, may not provide adequate space for their children's needs. The temporary accommodation provider should be encouraged to consider providing additional resources or accommodations to support the family's well-being.

Family dynamics appeared stable, with both parents actively involved in caring for their children. However, it is crucial to monitor the family's emotional state and provide regular support to prevent potential escalation of Javed's anxiety issues.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Referral to a specialist eye care service to assess Aisha's vision and provide guidance on necessary interventions.
2. Collaboration with local schools to develop an Individual Education Plan (IEP) for Aisha, addressing her visual impairment and ensuring she receives appropriate accommodations.
3. Engagement of a child psychologist or counselor to support Javed in managing his anxiety and behavioral issues.
4. Regular home visits by social services to monitor the family's well-being, provide emotional support, and facilitate access to necessary resources.

Timeline:

* Within the next two weeks: Arrange for Aisha's eye care assessment and referral to specialist services.
* Within the next four weeks: Establish a meeting with local schools to develop an IEP for Aisha.
* Ongoing: Schedule regular home visits by social services to monitor the family's progress and provide ongoing support.

By implementing these recommendations, we can ensure that this refugee family receives the necessary support to address their disabilities and improve their overall well-being.
