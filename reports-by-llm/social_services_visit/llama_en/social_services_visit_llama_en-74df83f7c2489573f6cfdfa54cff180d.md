Social Services Visit Report

Visit Date: 27 November 2024
Location: Uusikaupunki, Finland
Visit Type: Social reintegration assessment

Summary of Visit Purpose:
The purpose of this visit was to conduct a social reintegration assessment for the young couple, Antti and Aino Laaksonen, expecting their first child. The visit aimed to evaluate their living situation, family dynamics, and overall well-being in light of their moderate case severity.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival at the Laaksonen residence ( address: Kruununhaka 14, Uusikaupunki), I observed a warm and welcoming atmosphere. Antti and Aino were both present during my visit, and they provided me with information about their daily routines, work schedules, and plans for the upcoming arrival of their child.

The living conditions at the residence appeared to be satisfactory, with adequate space for the growing family. However, I noted that the couple's financial situation was a concern, as they reported struggling to make ends meet due to Antti's limited job opportunities in his field. Aino was employed part-time, but her income was not sufficient to cover all their expenses.

During our conversation, I observed that both Antti and Aino were enthusiastic about becoming parents, but also expressed concerns about their ability to provide a stable environment for their child. They discussed the importance of education and career development for their future child's well-being.

Assessment:
Based on my observations during the visit, it is clear that the Laaksonen couple faces significant challenges in terms of financial stability and career development. Their moderate case severity suggests that they require support to address these issues and ensure a stable environment for their growing family.

The couple's emotional state was generally positive, with a strong desire to provide a loving home for their child. However, I noted some signs of stress and anxiety related to their financial situation and the upcoming arrival of their child. It is essential that they receive guidance on managing their finances, accessing support services, and developing strategies for career advancement.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Referral to local employment services: Antti will be referred to a job training program to enhance his employability skills.
2. Financial assistance: The couple will be eligible for financial assistance through the Finnish government's social welfare system.
3. Parenting classes: Aino and Antti will participate in parenting classes to prepare them for the challenges of parenthood.
4. Regular follow-up visits: I will schedule regular follow-up visits (every 6 months) to monitor the couple's progress, provide ongoing support, and address any emerging concerns.

Timeline:

* Next follow-up visit: 30 April 2025
* Antti's job training program: commencing on 1 February 2025

Conclusion:
This social services visit has provided an initial assessment of the Laaksonen couple's situation. It is essential that we continue to monitor their progress, provide ongoing support, and address any emerging concerns to ensure a stable environment for their growing family.
