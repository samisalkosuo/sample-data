Social Services Visit Report

Date: 22 February 2025
Location: Kemij√§rvi, Finland
Case Reference Number: KJ-2024-001

Summary of Visit Purpose:
This follow-up visit was conducted to assess the situation of the Lappinen family, who were previously reported for school truancy. The purpose of this visit is to evaluate the effectiveness of any interventions implemented and to identify any new concerns that may have arisen.

Observations During the Visit:

Upon arrival at the Lappinen residence, I was greeted by Mrs. Lappinen, who provided a warm welcome. The family was present during the visit, with all four children in attendance. The living conditions were satisfactory, with clean and well-maintained furniture and appliances. However, the home could benefit from some minor repairs to ensure energy efficiency.

During our conversation, I observed that the family is making an effort to address their truancy issues. Mr. Lappinen reported that he has been working closely with the school administration to develop a plan for his children's education, which includes regular check-ins and progress monitoring. The children also expressed enthusiasm about returning to school and catching up on missed lessons.

Notable concerns were raised regarding the family's financial situation. Mrs. Lappinen mentioned that they are struggling to make ends meet due to reduced income from Mr. Lappinen's job. This has led to some stress and anxiety within the household, particularly among the children.

Assessment:
The overall assessment is that the Lappinen family is making progress in addressing their truancy issues. However, the financial strain poses a risk to their well-being and stability. The low case severity rating reflects the manageable nature of this situation, but it is essential to continue monitoring the family's progress and providing support as needed.

Recommended Actions or Follow-up:

1. Referral to local employment services: To address Mr. Lappinen's reduced income, I recommend referring him to a local employment agency that can provide guidance on job search strategies and potential training opportunities.
2. Home energy efficiency assistance: The family could benefit from some home energy efficiency measures, such as insulation or double-glazing, to reduce their energy bills and alleviate financial stress.
3. Regular progress monitoring: Schedule regular check-ins with the school administration to monitor the children's progress and provide additional support if needed.
4. Family counseling: Consider offering family counseling sessions to address the emotional impact of financial stress on the household.

Timeline for Further Visits:
