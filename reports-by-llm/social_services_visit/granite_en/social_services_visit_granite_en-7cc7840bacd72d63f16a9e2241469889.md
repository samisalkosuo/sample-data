**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This routine family wellbeing visit was conducted due to the urgent case of an unaccompanied minor residing in temporary housing. The purpose was to assess the minor's living conditions, emotional state, and overall wellbeing, as well as to identify any immediate needs or risks.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at Aino M채kel채's temporary housing unit, the minor, 16-year-old Anna, appeared withdrawn and anxious. The living conditions were minimal, with a single bed, a small table, and limited personal belongings. The room lacked proper ventilation, contributing to a stuffy atmosphere. Anna expressed feeling isolated and overwhelmed by her circumstances. She mentioned missing her previous school and friends, highlighting the emotional toll of her situation.

**Assessment**

Anna's current living conditions pose immediate risks to her physical and mental health. The lack of adequate ventilation exacerbates potential respiratory issues, while the isolation contributes to her reported anxiety and depression. The absence of a stable support system further compounds these concerns. Given the urgency of the case, it is crucial to address Anna's immediate needs and provide ongoing support to facilitate her transition towards a more stable living arrangement.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. Arrange for Anna's enrollment in a local educational program to ensure continuity of learning and social interaction.
2. Coordinate with temporary housing providers to secure a more suitable living environment, prioritizing better ventilation and privacy.
3. Initiate a referral to a mental health professional for ongoing counseling and support.
4. Establish regular follow-up visits to monitor Anna's progress, adjust support as needed, and maintain open communication with all involved parties.
5. Explore potential long-term housing options, including foster care or group homes, in collaboration with child protective services.

This report will be shared with relevant stakeholders, including temporary housing providers, educational institutions, mental health professionals, and child protective services, to ensure a coordinated and comprehensive response to Anna's urgent needs.
