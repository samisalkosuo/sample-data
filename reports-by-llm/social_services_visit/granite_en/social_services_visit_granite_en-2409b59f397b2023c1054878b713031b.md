---

**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted to evaluate the parental capacity of Aino Mäkelä, the legal guardian of 18-year-old Sanna Mäkelä, who is transitioning out of the foster care system. The high case severity indicates a critical need for assessment due to potential risks and challenges in Sanna's independent living transition.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at Aino Mäkelä's residence, the environment appeared tidy but lacked personal touches, suggesting a possible emotional distance or unfamiliarity with creating a nurturing home atmosphere. Sanna was present during the interview and displayed a guarded demeanor, answering questions succinctly without much eye contact. Aino seemed well-intentioned but appeared overwhelmed by the responsibility of supporting Sanna's transition to independent living. There were concerns regarding Sanna's limited social support network and her lack of practical life skills necessary for self-sufficiency.

**Assessment**

The assessment reveals a high-risk situation due to Sanna's impending transition without adequate preparation or support systems in place. Aino's parental capacity is questionable, primarily because of the insufficient planning and resources allocated for Sanna’s independent living needs. The emotional distance observed may also indicate challenges in providing consistent emotional support crucial during such a vulnerable life phase.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. Immediate referral to a transition program specializing in supporting youth aging out of foster care, focusing on life skills training and emotional well-being.
2. Arrange for a comprehensive parental capacity workshop for Aino, addressing effective communication strategies, boundary setting, and understanding the unique needs of transitioning youth.
3. Connect Sanna with peer support groups to build her social network and provide a platform for sharing experiences and coping strategies.
4. Schedule a follow-up visit in three months to reassess progress, evaluate the effectiveness of implemented interventions, and adjust support plans as necessary.

This report underscores the urgency for structured intervention to mitigate risks associated with Sanna's transition. Timely and targeted support is critical to ensure her successful integration into independent living and prevent potential future crises.
