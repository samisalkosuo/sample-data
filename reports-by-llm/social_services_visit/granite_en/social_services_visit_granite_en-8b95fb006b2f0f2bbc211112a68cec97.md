---

**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted due to an emergency housing verification request from Aino Mäkelä, a teenage mother residing with her parents and infant child in Padasjoki, Finland. The case severity is moderate, indicating a need for immediate attention and support.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at the Mäkelä household, I was greeted by Aino, her parents, and her infant child. The living conditions were moderately cramped, with three individuals sharing a single bedroom due to limited space in their current residence. The family appeared clean and well-groomed, but the overall environment seemed tense and somewhat chaotic.

Aino displayed signs of stress and anxiety, which is understandable given her young age and the responsibility of caring for an infant. Her parents, while supportive, appeared overwhelmed by the situation. The infant was present and appeared healthy, though there were concerns about the lack of a dedicated space for the baby to sleep safely.

**Assessment**

The family's current living conditions pose moderate risks, primarily due to the lack of privacy and potential safety hazards for the infant. The emotional strain on Aino is evident, which could impact her ability to provide adequate care for her child in the long term. The family dynamics are supportive, but the limited resources and space exacerbate their vulnerability.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. **Immediate Housing Support:** Coordinate with local housing authorities to secure temporary accommodation that meets safety standards for Aino and her infant. This should prioritize privacy and a safe sleeping environment for the baby.

2. **Parental Support Services:** Refer Aino's parents to parental support groups to help them navigate their new role as primary caregivers for the grandchild. This will alleviate some of the burden on Aino and provide additional emotional support.

3. **Aino's Individual Counseling:** Arrange for Aino to receive counseling services to address her stress and anxiety, equipping her with coping strategies and parenting skills. This should be a priority to ensure her well-being and ability to care for her child effectively.

4. **Follow-up Visit:** Schedule a follow-up visit within two weeks to assess the implementation of these recommendations and make any necessary adjustments to the support plan.

This report outlines the immediate steps required to address the moderate severity of Aino Mäkelä's case, focusing on ensuring a safe and supportive environment for both mother and child in Padasjoki, Finland.
