**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This follow-up visit was conducted in response to a school truancy report concerning Aapo Korhonen, a teenager residing in Lemi, Finland. The purpose was to assess the current situation, understand the underlying causes of school absenteeism, and determine appropriate interventions to support regular attendance.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at Aapo's home, I was greeted by his mother, Ms. Leena Korhonen. The living conditions appeared clean and adequate, with no immediate safety concerns. Aapo, 15 years old, was present during the conversation. He seemed withdrawn and reluctant to engage in conversation, displaying signs of anxiety.

During our discussion, Ms. Korhonen expressed her concern about Aapo's recent behavioral changes and increasing school absences. She mentioned that Aapo had been struggling with peer relationships at school and felt isolated. Aapo confirmed these feelings, admitting to skipping classes due to anxiety and a lack of motivation.

**Assessment**

The case severity is currently moderate, primarily driven by Aapo's emotional distress and resulting school absenteeism. The family dynamics appear supportive, with Ms. Korhonen demonstrating a genuine desire to address her son's issues. However, the lack of open communication between Aapo and his mother indicates a need for improved dialogue and understanding.

The primary risk identified is the potential for further educational disengagement and worsening mental health if left unaddressed. Early intervention is crucial to prevent more severe consequences, such as prolonged school absence or social isolation.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. **Counseling Services:** Arrange for Aapo to receive individual counseling sessions with a mental health professional specializing in adolescent issues. This will provide him with a safe space to express his feelings and develop coping strategies.

2. **Family Therapy:** Schedule family therapy sessions to enhance communication and strengthen the parent-child relationship. Improved dialogue can help address Aapo's emotional needs and encourage his school attendance.

3. **School Liaison:** Collaborate with Aapo's school to monitor his attendance, provide academic support, and facilitate peer connections. This may involve connecting him with a mentor or tutor to boost his confidence and engagement in learning.

4. **Follow-up Visit:** Schedule a follow-up visit within four weeks to assess progress and adjust interventions as needed.

By addressing Aapo's emotional well-being and fostering open communication with his family, we aim to support his return to regular school attendance and promote his overall development.
