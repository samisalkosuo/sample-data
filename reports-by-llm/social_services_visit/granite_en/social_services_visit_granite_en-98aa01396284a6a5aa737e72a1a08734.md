---

**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted to assess the needs of Aino Mäkelä, an elderly woman residing in Ylitornio, Finland, who has been reported to be experiencing early dementia symptoms and potential substance abuse issues. The high case severity necessitated immediate attention and support.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at Aino's residence, I observed a cluttered living space with signs of neglect. Aino appeared disoriented and confused, exhibiting symptoms consistent with early-stage dementia. She was unsteady on her feet and required assistance to navigate the home. During our conversation, she displayed erratic behavior, including slurred speech and difficulty concentrating, which raised concerns about possible substance use.

Aino's daughter, Marja, was present during the visit. While Marja expressed concern for her mother's well-being, she appeared overwhelmed and lacked knowledge regarding dementia care and potential substance abuse issues. The strain of caring for Aino was evident in Marja's emotional state.

**Assessment**

Aino's cognitive decline, coupled with her unsteady gait and erratic behavior, suggests a high risk of falls and further health complications. The possibility of substance abuse exacerbates these concerns, potentially impairing judgment and increasing the risk of accidents. Marja's limited understanding of dementia care and her mother's potential substance use adds to the complexity of the situation.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. Immediate referral to a geriatrician for comprehensive assessment and management of Aino's dementia symptoms.
2. Arrangement for a substance abuse evaluation by a specialized healthcare professional to determine if substance use is a factor and, if so, to develop an appropriate treatment plan.
3. Connection with local support groups for caregivers, such as Dementia Friends Finland, to equip Marja with the necessary knowledge and resources to provide better care for Aino.
4. Home health assessment by a nurse to address any immediate safety concerns and establish a care plan to prevent falls and other accidents.
5. Schedule a follow-up visit within two weeks to monitor progress, reassess needs, and ensure adherence to recommended interventions.

This report serves as a starting point for addressing the complex needs of Aino Mäkelä and her daughter Marja. Collaborative efforts with healthcare professionals and support services are crucial to ensuring their well-being and mitigating identified risks.
