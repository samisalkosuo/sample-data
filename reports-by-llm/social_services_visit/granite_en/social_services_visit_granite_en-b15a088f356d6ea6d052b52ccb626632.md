**Case Context:** Separated Couple with Shared Custody, Case Severity: Critical

---

**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted due to an urgent referral regarding the separation of Aino Mäkelä and her partner, Marko Koskinen. The couple shares custody of their two minor children, 8-year-old Emma and 5-year-old Oskari. The critical case severity indicates an immediate need for intervention due to potential housing instability and its impact on the family's wellbeing.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at Aino Mäkelä's residence, I observed a cluttered living space with signs of recent disturbance. Aino appeared visibly stressed, confirming that Marko had left the premises unexpectedly, leaving her and the children without notice. The children were present but seemed relatively calm under the circumstances.

Aino expressed concern over Marko's erratic behavior since their separation, including verbal altercations and threats. She mentioned that he had previously threatened to damage their home if she pursued legal separation, which contributed to her current anxiety. The family has been staying with her in this rented apartment as a temporary measure while seeking permanent housing solutions.

**Assessment**

The assessment reveals a critical situation where the family's immediate safety and stability are at risk due to Marko Koskinen’s unpredictable behavior. The lack of permanent housing adds another layer of vulnerability, especially considering Aino's limited financial resources post-separation. Emma and Oskari's emotional wellbeing is also compromised by the ongoing tension and uncertainty.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. **Immediate Safety Measures:** Arrange for a restraining order to protect Aino and her children from Marko’s threats, ensuring legal documentation of his behavior.
   
2. **Emergency Housing Support:** Liaise with local housing authorities and non-profit organizations to secure temporary or emergency shelter for the family until a more permanent solution can be found.

3. **Counseling Services:** Refer Aino and her children to a family counselor specializing in separation and domestic tension to address emotional trauma and provide coping strategies.

4. **Legal Assistance:** Connect the family with legal aid services to navigate the separation process, custody arrangements, and potential financial support claims.

5. **Follow-up Visit:** Schedule a follow-up visit within one week to reassess the situation, monitor progress on housing and safety measures, and provide ongoing support coordination.

This report underscores the urgency of intervention to safeguard Aino Mäkelä and her children from immediate harm and to establish a stable environment conducive to their wellbeing.
