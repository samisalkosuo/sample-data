**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This routine family wellbeing visit was conducted to assess the current living conditions and emotional state of a blended family experiencing recent custody changes in Liperi, Finland. The purpose was to ensure the family's stability and address any potential concerns arising from these transitions.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at Aino Korhonen's residence, I was greeted by both parents, Mikko (father) and Aino, along with their children, 10-year-old Emma and 7-year-old Oskari. The family appeared clean and well-groomed, with a tidy living space. There were signs of recent redecorating in the common areas, suggesting an effort to create a harmonious environment post-custody changes.

During our conversation, Mikko and Aino expressed their commitment to co-parenting effectively despite the challenges posed by the custody arrangements. Emma and Oskari seemed comfortable and engaged in playful activities, indicating a relatively stable emotional state. However, there was a noticeable tension between Mikko and Aino, primarily concerning communication about the children's schedules and extracurricular activities.

**Assessment**

The family dynamics suggest a low-severity case, with the primary concern being effective communication and coordination between the parents following custody changes. While living conditions are adequate, the emotional wellbeing of both parents requires attention to prevent potential escalation into more serious issues. The children appear adjusted to their circumstances but may benefit from additional support in navigating these family dynamics.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. **Parental Counseling:** I recommend referring Mikko and Aino to a local couples counseling service specializing in post-separation family adjustments. This will equip them with tools to manage communication and cooperation effectively, reducing tension and fostering a more stable environment for the children.

2. **Family Therapy:** Schedule a series of family therapy sessions to address any unspoken concerns or emotional needs of Emma and Oskari. This will help them process their feelings about the custody changes and strengthen family bonds.

3. **Follow-up Visit:** Plan a follow-up visit in three months to reassess progress, adjust support strategies as necessary, and ensure ongoing wellbeing for all family members.

By addressing these recommendations, we aim to maintain the current low severity of this case and promote a healthy, adaptable family unit in Liperi, Finland.
