---

**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted as part of the routine veteran support service check-in for Mr. Jussi Koskinen, an elderly veteran residing with his adult daughter in Hollola, Finland. The high case severity indicates a critical need for ongoing support and assessment due to potential risks and complex family dynamics.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at Mr. Koskinen's residence, I was greeted by his daughter, Ms. Leena Koskinen, who appeared anxious and overwhelmed. Mr. Koskinen, aged 82, was present but seemed disoriented and required assistance with basic tasks. His living conditions were suboptimal, with clutter and safety hazards evident throughout the home. During our conversation, Mr. Koskinen expressed feelings of loneliness and frustration, mentioning unresolved issues related to his military service and ongoing health concerns. Ms. Koskinen disclosed that she works full-time and struggles to manage her father's needs alongside her own responsibilities.

**Assessment**

The assessment reveals a high-risk situation due to Mr. Koskinen's declining physical and mental health, coupled with inadequate support from his daughter who is already stretched thin by her work commitments. The living conditions pose potential safety hazards, and the family dynamics indicate a need for immediate intervention to prevent further deterioration in Mr. Koskinen's well-being and to alleviate stress on Ms. Koskinen.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. Arrange for a geriatric assessment of Mr. Koskinen to evaluate his health status and develop a tailored care plan, including potential in-home care services.
2. Connect the family with local respite care options to provide Ms. Koskinen with temporary relief from her caregiving duties.
3. Facilitate access to veteran-specific support groups and counseling services for Mr. Koskinen to address his unresolved military service issues and improve his emotional well-being.
4. Schedule a follow-up visit within one week to monitor progress, reassess needs, and ensure that recommended services are being implemented effectively.
5. Collaborate with regional veteran organizations to explore additional resources and benefits available to Mr. Koskinen based on his service history.
