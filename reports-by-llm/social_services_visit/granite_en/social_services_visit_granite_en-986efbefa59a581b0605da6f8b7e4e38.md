---

**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted as a follow-up to an initial assessment due to the critical case severity, involving elderly care provided by grandparents to their grandchildren within the household. The purpose was to evaluate the ongoing situation, family dynamics, and the wellbeing of all household members, particularly focusing on the grandparents' capacity to continue caring for the children.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at Ms. Aino Koskinen's residence in central Kokkola, it was evident that the living conditions were substandard for a family of four, including two elderly grandparents and two young grandchildren. The home displayed signs of disrepair, with peeling paint, a leaky roof causing water damage in the children's bedroom, and limited furniture suitable for adults.

During interactions, Ms. Koskinen, aged 68, appeared fatigued but insisted on maintaining care for her grandchildren due to financial constraints that prevented them from seeking external childcare or assisted living arrangements. Her 72-year-old husband, Matti, showed signs of cognitive decline, often repeating questions and requiring assistance with basic tasks. The children, aged 5 and 8, were well-cared for in terms of immediate needs but displayed signs of emotional distress, likely due to their parents' absence and the strain on their grandparents.

**Assessment**

The assessment reveals a critical situation where the elderly caregivers are overwhelmed, with limited resources to address both their own health needs and those of the children. The household environment poses significant health risks, including potential mold growth from roof leaks and inadequate heating, which could exacerbate Matti's cognitive issues and affect the childrenâ€™s respiratory health.

Family dynamics indicate a strong commitment to care but are stretched beyond their capabilities. The absence of external support leaves the grandparents vulnerable to burnout and potential health crises, threatening the stability of the household and the children's upbringing.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. **Immediate Housing Intervention:** Arrange for a housing inspection by local authorities to address safety concerns such as roof leaks and overall habitability. Explore temporary relocation options if necessary to ensure a safe environment for the children.

2. **Healthcare Referral:** Urgently refer Matti Koskinen for a comprehensive geriatric assessment to evaluate his cognitive health and explore possible support services, including home care or assisted living facilities.

3. **Social Services Support:** Initiate a full needs assessment for the family, connecting them with financial assistance programs to alleviate economic pressures that prevent access to childcare and elderly care services.

4. **Psychological Evaluation for Children:** Schedule a psychological evaluation for the grandchildren to monitor their emotional wellbeing and provide appropriate counseling or support services if needed.

5. **Follow-up Visit:** Plan a follow-up visit within two weeks to reassess progress, ensure compliance with recommended actions, and adjust the support plan as necessary.

This report underscores the urgency of intervention to prevent further deterioration in the health and wellbeing of all household members. Immediate and comprehensive support is critical to address the multifaceted challenges faced by this family.
