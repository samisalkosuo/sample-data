**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted to review the support plan for Aino Mäkelä, a single mother residing in Sysmä, Finland, with three children. The purpose was to assess the ongoing effectiveness of the current support measures and make any necessary adjustments to ensure the family's well-being remains stable and any emerging needs are addressed promptly.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at Aino Mäkelä's residence, the living conditions appeared clean and organized, albeit modest. The children were present during the meeting, engaged in quiet activities, indicating a routine of discipline and respect for their mother’s work time. Aino was cooperative, articulate, and demonstrated a clear understanding of her support plan. She expressed gratitude for the assistance received thus far, particularly the childcare support that allows her to pursue vocational training.

The emotional state of all family members seemed positive, with Aino displaying resilience and determination. There were no immediate concerns noted regarding the children's development or behavior; they appeared healthy and well-cared for.

**Assessment**

Given the low case severity, the family is currently stable. Aino’s proactive engagement in vocational training signifies her commitment to improving her employability and, consequently, the family's financial situation. The children's school attendance records are satisfactory, and there are no indications of neglect or abuse.

The primary risk identified is Aino’s reliance on external support for childcare, which could be mitigated by further skill development leading to sustainable employment. Ensuring access to affordable childcare options post-training is crucial for long-term stability.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. Continue the current support plan with a focus on Aino's vocational training, ensuring she completes her course successfully.
2. Explore additional childcare solutions post-training, possibly through partnerships with local community centers or educational institutions offering subsidized care for working parents.
3. Schedule a follow-up meeting in two months to reassess progress, particularly Aino’s employment prospects and the family's financial situation.
4. Maintain open communication channels for any urgent needs or changes in circumstances that may require immediate attention.

This report reflects a positive interaction with a family demonstrating resilience and actively seeking improvement. Continued support tailored to Aino’s training completion and subsequent employment is recommended to ensure lasting stability for the household.
