---

**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This safety plan monitoring visit was conducted to assess the well-being and living conditions of Aino and Jussi Korhonen, a young couple residing in Kaskinen, Finland, who are expecting their first child. The high case severity indicates potential risks that necessitate close monitoring and timely intervention.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at the Korhonen household, I was greeted by Aino, who appeared anxious yet cooperative. Jussi was present but seemed withdrawn and less engaged in the conversation. Their modest apartment displayed signs of disarray, with clutter and unattended maintenance issues such as a leaking faucet and peeling paint on the walls. Aino mentioned they are currently facing financial strain, which has impacted their ability to maintain a safe and stable environment for the impending arrival of their child.

During our conversation, Aino expressed concerns about Jussi's recent change in behavior, noting increased irritability and occasional outbursts. She also disclosed that Jussi had been consuming alcohol more frequently, which she fears may escalate into a risk for both himself and their unborn child.

**Assessment**

The assessment reveals a high-risk situation due to the combination of financial stress, potential substance abuse, and altered family dynamics. The couple's inability to address basic maintenance issues within their home suggests difficulties in prioritizing essential needs, which may pose safety hazards for the newborn. Furthermore, Jussi's behavioral changes and alcohol consumption raise concerns about his emotional stability and potential for domestic violence.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. Immediate referral to an addiction counseling service for Jussi to address suspected alcohol abuse and its impact on family safety.
2. Connection with a local financial counselor to assist the couple in managing their finances and accessing available community resources.
3. Arrangement for regular check-ins with Aino to monitor her well-being, provide emotional support, and ensure she feels empowered to make decisions regarding her safety and that of her unborn child.
4. Coordination with a domestic violence prevention program to offer Jussi alternative coping mechanisms and anger management strategies.
5. Schedule a follow-up visit within one week to reassess the situation, evaluate the effectiveness of implemented support services, and make further adjustments as necessary.

This report underscores the urgency for timely and comprehensive intervention to safeguard the well-being of Aino, Jussi, and their unborn child in Kaskinen, Finland.
