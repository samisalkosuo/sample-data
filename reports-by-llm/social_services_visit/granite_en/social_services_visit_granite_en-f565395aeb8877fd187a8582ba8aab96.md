---

**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted as a follow-up to the parenting education program, aimed at supporting Aino M채kel채 and her two children in managing and preventing future incidents of domestic violence. The family has a history of chronic domestic violence, with moderate case severity, necessitating ongoing support and monitoring.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at Aino's residence, I was greeted by her and her children, who appeared clean and well-groomed. The living conditions were adequate, with a tidy home environment. Aino displayed a cooperative attitude during our conversation, expressing understanding of the need for improved communication and conflict resolution skills within the family.

During our discussion, Aino shared her progress in parenting education classes, acknowledging the importance of setting boundaries and fostering open dialogue with her children. She also mentioned participating in a local support group for victims of domestic violence, which she found helpful in processing emotions and gaining confidence.

However, Aino expressed concerns about her partner's occasional unpredictable behavior and the fear it instilled in her and the children. She emphasized the need for continued support to address these issues effectively.

**Assessment**

Aino has demonstrated a commitment to learning and implementing parenting skills learned through education programs, which is encouraging. The family dynamics show signs of improvement, with Aino actively seeking ways to protect her children from further harm. Nevertheless, the history of chronic domestic violence and lingering concerns about her partner's behavior necessitate ongoing support and monitoring.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. Encourage Aino to continue attending parenting education classes and support groups for victims of domestic violence, as these provide essential emotional and practical tools for managing family life.
2. Arrange a referral to a local counseling service specializing in domestic violence intervention and prevention, to address Aino's partner's behavior and promote healthier relationship dynamics within the household.
3. Schedule a joint session with Aino, her partner (if present), and a family therapist to facilitate open communication, boundary-setting, and conflict resolution strategies tailored to their specific needs.
4. Plan a follow-up visit in four weeks to assess progress, reevaluate risks, and adjust support measures as necessary.

This report will be shared with the relevant social service agencies involved in Aino's case for coordinated care and support.
