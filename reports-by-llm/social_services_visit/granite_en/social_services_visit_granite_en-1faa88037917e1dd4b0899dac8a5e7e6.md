**Social Services Visit Report**

*Client Name:* Aino & Oskari Koskinen  
*Address:* Kauppakatu 12, Hausjärvi, Finland  
*Visit Date:* 15.09.2024

**Summary of Visit Purpose:**
This child welfare check was conducted due to a high-severity case involving grandparents, Aino and Oskari Koskinen, who are currently providing care for their three grandchildren: 8-year-old Elias, 6-year-old Maija, and 3-year-old Leo. The visit was prompted by concerns regarding the children's well-being, as reported by a local school teacher who noticed signs of neglect and potential emotional distress in the younger grandchildren.

**Observations During the Visit:**
Upon arrival, Aino and Oskari warmly welcomed us into their modest home. The living conditions were clean but showed signs of disorganization and lacked essential child-friendly resources. There was a single shared bedroom for Elias and Maija, while Leo slept in a makeshift cot in the living room.

During our interaction with the children:
- Elias appeared withdrawn and struggled to maintain eye contact, often fidgeting with his hands.
- Maija was more outgoing but displayed signs of anxiety, frequently seeking reassurance from her grandparents.
- Leo was energetic yet seemed to lack proper supervision, engaging in risky play without adult attention.

Aino and Oskari expressed their dedication to caring for the children but acknowledged feeling overwhelmed by their responsibilities, particularly concerning emotional support and educational needs.

**Assessment:**
The assessment reveals a high-risk situation due to inadequate resources, potential neglect, and insufficient emotional support for the grandchildren. The grandparents' admirable intentions are overshadowed by their limited capacity to address the children's complex needs effectively. There is an urgent need to ensure the children receive appropriate educational stimulation, emotional nurturing, and safe living conditions.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up:**
1. Immediate referral to a family support service for in-home assistance with childcare and household organization.
2. Arrangement of regular home visits by a social worker to monitor progress and provide ongoing support.
3. Referral to a child psychologist for Elias and Maija to address their emotional concerns and ensure healthy development.
4. Enrollment in local educational programs tailored for young children, focusing on cognitive and social skill development.
5. Schedule a follow-up visit within two weeks to reassess the situation and adjust interventions as necessary.

This report underscores the critical need for timely and comprehensive support to safeguard the well-being of these vulnerable grandchildren under Aino and Oskari Koskinen's care in Hausjärvi, Finland.
