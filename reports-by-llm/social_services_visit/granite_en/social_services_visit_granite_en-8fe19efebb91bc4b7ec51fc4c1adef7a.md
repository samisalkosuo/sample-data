**Social Services Visit Report**

*Visit Date: 12.11.2024*
*Location: Geta, Finland*
*Client Name: Marja Koskinen*
*Address: Kauppakatu 23, 65100 Geta, Finland*
*Visit Type: Veteran Support Service Check-in*
*Household Composition: Single woman recovering from domestic abuse*
*Case Severity: Urgent*

**Summary of Visit Purpose:**
This visit was conducted as a routine check-in for veteran support services, given the urgent case severity of a single woman in Geta, Finland, who is currently recovering from domestic abuse. The purpose was to assess her living conditions, emotional state, and overall well-being, while identifying any immediate needs or risks that require intervention.

**Observations During the Visit:**
Upon arrival at Marja Koskinen's residence, I found a modest apartment with signs of recent cleaning efforts. Marja appeared visibly anxious and guarded during our interaction. She confirmed her status as a veteran and shared that she had recently escaped from an abusive partner. Her emotional state was subdued, with occasional signs of distress.

Marja expressed gratitude for the support services but also conveyed feelings of isolation and fear regarding potential retaliation from her former partner. She mentioned having limited social connections due to the abuse, which further complicates her recovery process. The apartment was safe and tidy, with no immediate safety hazards identified.

**Assessment:**
Given Marja's recent escape from domestic abuse and her reported fear of retaliation, this case is deemed urgent. Her emotional state suggests the presence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, which may require professional mental health support. Additionally, her limited social connections increase her vulnerability and necessitate immediate intervention to establish a support network.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up:**
1. Arrange for an urgent mental health assessment with a trauma-informed therapist specializing in veterans' issues.
2. Connect Marja with local women's shelters or safe houses, should she require temporary relocation due to safety concerns.
3. Facilitate her enrollment in a support group for survivors of domestic abuse, fostering peer connections and shared experiences.
4. Schedule a follow-up visit within one week to monitor progress, address any emerging needs, and reinforce the importance of ongoing support.
5. Collaborate with law enforcement to ensure her safety and explore legal options against her abuser, if applicable.

This report will be shared with relevant service providers to coordinate a comprehensive response addressing Marja Koskinen's immediate needs and long-term recovery.
