**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted due to an emergency housing verification request from Aino Mäkelä, a teenage mother residing with her infant and grandparents in Kangasala, Finland. The purpose was to assess the immediate living conditions, family dynamics, and overall well-being of the household in light of the reported moderate case severity.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at Aino's residence, I was greeted by her grandparents who appeared concerned yet cooperative. The living conditions were adequate, with separate rooms for the family members. The infant, Aino's daughter, seemed healthy and well-cared for.

Aino appeared tired but composed during our interaction. She expressed gratitude for her grandparents' support and acknowledged the challenges of young motherhood. Her emotional state was stable, though she mentioned occasional feelings of overwhelm and isolation.

Notable concerns included Aino's limited social network and lack of access to parenting resources or support groups. Additionally, there were indications that Aino's grandparents might benefit from respite care services to alleviate some of their caregiving responsibilities.

**Assessment**

The current situation presents moderate risks primarily due to the young age of the mother and her limited external support system. While the family demonstrates a strong bond and functional dynamics, Aino's well-being could be significantly improved with access to appropriate resources and support networks. The grandparents, though willing and capable caregivers, may face physical strain from prolonged caregiving duties.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. Connect Aino with local parenting support groups and workshops to foster her social integration and provide essential parenting skills training.
2. Arrange for respite care services for the grandparents to ensure they receive necessary rest and support, preventing potential burnout.
3. Facilitate access to financial assistance programs or employment support for Aino to enhance her self-sufficiency and reduce reliance on family support.
4. Schedule a follow-up visit in four weeks to reassess the family's situation, evaluate the effectiveness of implemented services, and make further adjustments as needed.
