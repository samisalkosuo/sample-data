**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted to provide substance abuse support to Ms. Aino Mäkelä, who is currently in the process of recovery from domestic abuse. The purpose was to assess her living conditions, emotional state, and overall well-being, as well as to offer guidance and resources for continued recovery.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at Ms. Mäkelä's residence, I found a clean and organized living space, indicating her commitment to maintaining a stable environment during her recovery. Aino appeared calm and composed, expressing gratitude for the support she has received thus far. She shared that she has been attending regular therapy sessions and participating in a local support group for survivors of domestic abuse.

During our conversation, Aino mentioned occasional cravings for alcohol, which she attributes to stress from her recent separation and ongoing legal proceedings against her former partner. She has not engaged in substance use since seeking help three months ago, demonstrating a strong will to remain sober.

**Assessment**

Given the low case severity, Ms. Mäkelä's living conditions are stable, and she has shown resilience in managing her recovery from both domestic abuse and potential substance abuse issues. Her proactive engagement in therapy and support groups is commendable and suggests a lower risk of relapse. However, it is crucial to monitor her emotional well-being during this critical phase, particularly as she navigates legal processes related to her past trauma.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. Continue regular check-ins every two weeks to monitor progress and offer ongoing support.
2. Encourage Aino to explore stress management techniques, such as mindfulness or yoga classes, which can be beneficial in coping with the emotional challenges of her situation.
3. Facilitate a referral to a local counselor specializing in trauma-related stress for additional emotional support.
4. Schedule a follow-up visit in one month to reassess her situation and adjust support strategies as needed.

In conclusion, Aino Mäkelä is demonstrating positive progress in her recovery journey. With continued support and access to appropriate resources, she is well-positioned to maintain her sobriety and navigate the complexities of her recent experiences successfully.
