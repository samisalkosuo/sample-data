---

**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This safety plan monitoring visit was conducted to assess the ongoing effectiveness of the established safety plan for a household where the parent suffers from substance use disorder. The high case severity necessitates regular monitoring due to potential risks associated with the parent's condition and its impact on the children's well-being.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival, the residence appeared tidy, suggesting recent cleaning efforts. The parent, Ms. Aino Miettinen, was present and cooperative. She displayed signs of fatigue but was engaged in conversation. The children were observed playing quietly in another room, supervised by an older sibling.

During the interview, Ms. Miettinen acknowledged her ongoing struggle with substance use and expressed a commitment to treatment. She reported attending regular therapy sessions and participating in a support group, which she found helpful. However, she mentioned occasional lapses due to stress and peer pressure.

The children appeared healthy and well-cared for, with appropriate access to food and clothing. Emotionally, they seemed resilient but displayed some anxiety, likely stemming from their awareness of their parent's condition.

**Assessment**

The household dynamics indicate a high-risk situation due to the parent's substance use disorder. While Ms. Miettinen demonstrates a willingness to engage in treatment and support, the potential for relapse remains a significant concern. The children's emotional well-being is at risk due to their exposure to their parent's substance use and the associated instability.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. Continue regular safety plan monitoring visits to assess progress and address any emerging concerns promptly.
2. Encourage Ms. Miettinen to participate in intensive outpatient treatment, which may provide additional support and structure to manage her substance use.
3. Refer the family to a family therapy program to address the impact of substance use on family dynamics and to equip the children with coping strategies.
4. Schedule a follow-up visit within two weeks to review Ms. Miettinen's treatment adherence and the children's emotional well-being.

This report will be shared with the multidisciplinary team involved in Ms. Miettinen's care to ensure a coordinated and supportive approach for the entire family.
