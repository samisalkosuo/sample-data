**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted as a domestic violence risk assessment for a young couple, Aino Mäkelä and Jussi Kivinen, who are expecting their first child in Kruunupyy, Finland. The purpose was to evaluate the current family dynamics, identify potential risks, and provide appropriate support and resources.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at the Mäkelä-Kivinen residence, Aino greeted me warmly while Jussi remained reserved. The living conditions were adequate, with a clean and organized home environment. During our conversation, Aino expressed her excitement about the upcoming birth but also shared concerns about Jussi's occasional short temper and increasing stress levels due to impending parenthood.

Jussi acknowledged his frustration but assured me he would seek help if needed. Both parties appeared to have a moderate level of understanding regarding domestic violence, yet Aino seemed more cautious about Jussi's behavioral changes. There were no visible signs of physical harm or immediate danger during the visit.

**Assessment**

Based on the observations and information gathered, the case severity is classified as moderate. While there have been no reported incidents of physical violence, the emotional strain on both partners and Jussi's admitted struggle with managing stress suggest a potential risk for escalation in future. Aino demonstrated insight into recognizing warning signs and expressed a desire to ensure a safe environment for their unborn child.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. **Counseling Services:** Refer Jussi Kivinen to individual counseling sessions focusing on stress management, anger control, and parenting skills. This will equip him with tools to navigate the challenges of anticipated fatherhood constructively.

2. **Parenting Classes:** Encourage both Aino and Jussi to participate in joint parenting classes that emphasize communication, conflict resolution, and positive discipline techniques. These classes can foster a healthier relationship dynamic within the household.

3. **Support Groups:** Introduce Aino to a local support group for expectant mothers facing similar challenges. This will provide her with an opportunity to share experiences, gain emotional support, and learn coping strategies from peers.

4. **Follow-up Visit:** Schedule a follow-up visit in four weeks to reassess the situation, monitor progress, and offer additional support as needed. 

By addressing these recommendations, we aim to mitigate identified risks, strengthen family resilience, and ensure a safe environment for the newborn. Continuous monitoring and open communication will be crucial in supporting this young family through their transition into parenthood.
