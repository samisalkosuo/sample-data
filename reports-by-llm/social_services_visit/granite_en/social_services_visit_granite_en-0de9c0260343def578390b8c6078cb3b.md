**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This safety plan monitoring visit was conducted to assess the well-being and preparedness of Aini and Jussi Korhonen, a young couple in their late twenties, who are expecting their first child. The purpose was to ensure that the family is adequately supported and that their living conditions meet safety standards for the impending arrival of their baby.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at the Korhonen residence, I found a clean and organized home environment. Aini appeared calm and engaged, while Jussi was attentive and supportive. They have set up a nursery with essential baby items such as a crib, changing table, and clothing. The couple expressed excitement about the upcoming birth and demonstrated an understanding of basic newborn care routines.

During our conversation, Aini shared that they are attending prenatal classes and have established contact with a local midwife for regular check-ups. Jussi mentioned working part-time to support the family financially while also assisting with household chores. The couple's emotional state was positive, and there were no signs of distress or conflict.

**Assessment**

The Korhonens' living conditions are satisfactory, with a safe and comfortable home environment for the expected child. They have taken proactive steps in preparing for their baby’s arrival by attending prenatal classes and arranging medical care. The family dynamics appear stable, with both parents actively involved in the preparation process.

Given the low case severity, there are currently no immediate safety concerns. However, ongoing support is recommended to ensure they continue to feel confident and prepared for parenthood.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. Encourage continued participation in prenatal classes and regular medical appointments with the midwife.
2. Provide information on local parenting support groups and resources available post-delivery, such as breastfeeding support or infant care workshops.
3. Schedule a follow-up visit approximately two months after the baby's birth to assess the family’s adjustment to parenthood and address any emerging needs.
4. Offer access to a helpline for new parents, should they require additional assistance or have questions during this transition period.

The Korhonens are well-positioned to care for their upcoming child with the support systems they've already established. Regular check-ins will help ensure that any future concerns can be addressed promptly.
