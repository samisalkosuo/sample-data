---

**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted to assess the progress of a refugee family's reunification process and evaluate their living conditions within temporary accommodation. The case severity is low, indicating stable circumstances with minor adjustments needed for successful integration into the community.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at Aisha Khan's residence on Kauppakatu, I was greeted by Aisha, her husband Mohammad, and their two children, 8-year-old Fatima and 5-year-old Ali. The family appeared clean and well-groomed, with a tidy living space considering the temporary nature of their accommodation. 

Aisha expressed gratitude for the support received thus far but conveyed concerns about the children's integration into local schools and limited access to community resources due to language barriers. Both parents demonstrated a strong desire to learn Finnish, evident in their consistent attendance at language classes. The children seemed happy and engaged, playing with toys provided by a local NGO.

**Assessment**

The family's living conditions are satisfactory for temporary housing, though improvements could be made regarding storage space and privacy. There are no immediate safety risks identified. Family dynamics appear positive, with clear parental involvement in childcare and education. The primary challenge lies in addressing the language barrier to facilitate smoother integration into Finnish society, particularly for educational and social activities.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. Arrange a meeting with the local school authorities to discuss Fatima and Ali's enrollment, ensuring they receive necessary support such as Finnish language tutoring or bilingual educational materials.
   
2. Connect Aisha and Mohammad with adult education programs focusing on Finnish language proficiency, aiming for intermediate level within the next six months to enhance their employment prospects and community engagement.

3. Schedule a follow-up visit in three months to reassess progress in language acquisition, school integration, and overall family well-being. 

4. Provide information about available community resources like parenting workshops, cultural orientation sessions, and recreational activities for refugee families to foster social connections.

This report reflects a low-severity case with manageable challenges. With targeted support in language acquisition and community integration, the Khan family is well-positioned for successful long-term settlement in Virolahti.
