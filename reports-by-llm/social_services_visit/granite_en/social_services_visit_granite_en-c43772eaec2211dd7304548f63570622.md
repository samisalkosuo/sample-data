---

**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted as part of the routine check-in for veteran support services, focusing on the wellbeing and living conditions of Jari and Maija Karhunen, two adult siblings sharing housing in Karstula, Finland. The moderate case severity indicates a need for ongoing support due to specific challenges faced by the clients as veterans.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at the Karhunens' residence, both Jari and Maija greeted the social worker warmly. The living conditions were moderately clean, though there was evidence of some disorganization and clutter, suggesting potential difficulties in maintaining a structured routine. Jari, a recent veteran, appeared fatigued but engaged during conversation. Maija, his sister and caregiver, seemed concerned yet resilient, managing household tasks despite her own health limitations.

Emotionally, both expressed gratitude for the support services but also voiced concerns about their financial stability and Jari's struggle to adapt to civilian life post-military service. There were no immediate safety risks observed, yet the moderate case severity underscores underlying issues requiring attention.

**Assessment**

The assessment reveals that while the siblings maintain a supportive relationship, their current situation is impacted by Jari's transition challenges and Maija's health issues. Financial strain exacerbates these difficulties, potentially leading to increased stress and risk of isolation. The moderate severity indicates a need for targeted interventions rather than crisis management.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. **Financial Counseling:** Arrange a session with a financial advisor specializing in veteran benefits to explore options for improving their economic stability.
   
2. **Veteran Transition Support Group:** Enroll Jari in a local veteran support group to facilitate peer interaction and shared experiences, aiding his adjustment to civilian life.

3. **Health Assessment for Maija:** Schedule a comprehensive health evaluation to address her concerns and ensure appropriate care, potentially alleviating some of the burden on Jari.

4. **Follow-up Visit:** Plan a follow-up check-in within four weeks to reassess progress, adjust support strategies as necessary, and provide ongoing encouragement and resources.

This report encapsulates the findings from the veteran support service check-in visit to the Karhunen household in Karstula, Finland, on 06.06.2025. The recommended actions aim to address the identified moderate case severity through targeted interventions that support both immediate needs and long-term wellbeing.
