---

**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted to assess the disability support needs of a single mother residing in Puolanka, Finland, with three children. The high case severity indicates significant challenges that require immediate attention and intervention.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at Aino Mäkelä's residence, I was greeted by a visibly anxious single mother and her three children. The living conditions were modest but clean, with basic necessities provided. The eldest child, 15-year-old Eero, appeared to have mobility issues, requiring assistance for movement around the house. Aino expressed concern about Eero's increasing difficulty in managing daily tasks due to a recently diagnosed muscular condition.

The middle child, 12-year-old Anna, showed signs of emotional distress, often withdrawing during our conversation. Aino mentioned that Anna has been exhibiting behavioral changes since the onset of Eero's deteriorating health, possibly due to increased responsibilities at home and feelings of helplessness. The youngest child, 8-year-old Olli, seemed content but was often left unattended, raising concerns about his safety and developmental needs.

**Assessment**

The family's situation presents several critical issues:
1. Aino, the primary caregiver, is overwhelmed by her responsibilities, including managing Eero's condition and ensuring the well-being of her younger children. Her emotional state suggests potential burnout, which could negatively impact her ability to provide adequate care.
2. Eero's mobility issues require immediate attention, as his condition is rapidly progressing. Without proper support, he risks further deterioration and potential isolation due to inability to engage in social activities with peers.
3. Anna's emotional distress and behavioral changes indicate a need for psychological support to address her feelings of responsibility and helplessness. Her mental health must be prioritized to prevent long-term consequences on her development.
4. Olli's unmet needs, both in terms of supervision and stimulation, could lead to developmental delays or behavioral issues if not addressed promptly.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. Arrange a comprehensive assessment for Eero with a specialist in muscular disorders to determine the most appropriate support and treatment plan.
2. Refer Anna to a child psychologist for counseling to help her cope with the emotional stress of her brother's condition and manage any behavioral concerns.
3. Coordinate with local community resources to provide respite care for Aino, allowing her some time for self-care and reducing her risk of burnout.
4. Schedule regular follow-up visits to monitor Eero's progress, assess Anna's mental health, and ensure Olli's developmental needs are being met.
5. Explore options for additional support services, such as home help or educational resources, to alleviate some of Aino's daily burdens and enhance the family's overall well-being.

This report underscores the urgency of intervention in the Mäkelä household to address the complex needs arising from Eero's disability and its impact on the entire family dynamic. Immediate action is required to prevent further deterioration in the children's conditions, both physical and psychological, and to support Aino in her caregiving role.
