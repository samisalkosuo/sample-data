---

**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This mental health monitoring visit was conducted to assess Aino Mäkelä's emotional well-being and coping mechanisms as she transitions from the foster care system into independent living. The purpose is to identify any potential risks, provide necessary support, and ensure a smooth transition for this young adult.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at Aino's apartment, I was greeted by a clean and modestly furnished space. Aino appeared well-groomed but displayed signs of anxiety, such as fidgeting and avoiding eye contact during our conversation. She expressed concerns about managing finances, finding employment, and maintaining independence.

Aino disclosed that she has been experiencing mild depressive symptoms since leaving foster care three months ago. She reported occasional difficulty sleeping and a lack of motivation to engage in daily activities. Aino also mentioned feeling isolated, as most of her previous support network resided within the foster home environment.

**Assessment**

Aino's situation presents moderate case severity due to her recent transition into independent living, coupled with emerging mental health concerns. The young adult demonstrates some adaptive skills, such as maintaining personal hygiene and managing basic household chores. However, her emotional state warrants attention, as she exhibits symptoms indicative of adjustment disorder following the significant life change.

Family dynamics in this case primarily revolve around Aino's relationship with foster care workers who have provided support during her upbringing. There is a lack of biological family involvement, which may contribute to feelings of isolation and loneliness.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. **Mental Health Support:** Arrange for Aino to commence individual therapy sessions with a licensed counselor specializing in transition support for youth aging out of foster care. This should include cognitive-behavioral techniques to address anxiety and depressive symptoms.

2. **Employment Assistance:** Connect Aino with local employment services to aid in her job search, including resume building workshops and interview preparation sessions.

3. **Peer Support Groups:** Encourage participation in peer support groups for young adults who have experienced foster care, to foster a sense of community and reduce feelings of isolation.

4. **Financial Literacy Training:** Schedule Aino for financial literacy classes to build confidence in managing her independent living expenses effectively.

5. **Follow-up Visit:** Plan a follow-up visit in four weeks to reassess Aino's progress, adjust support strategies as necessary, and continue monitoring her mental health status. 

This report will be shared with the assigned caseworker and relevant service providers to ensure coordinated care for Aino Mäkelä during this critical transition period.
