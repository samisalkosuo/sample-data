**Summary of Visit Purpose:**

This visit was conducted as part of a youth mentoring program assessment for a refugee family currently residing in temporary accommodation in Saarijärvi, Finland. The purpose was to evaluate the family's living conditions, assess their needs, and understand their dynamics within the context of moderate case severity.

**Observations During the Visit:**

Upon arrival at Aisha Khan's residence, I was greeted by Aisha, her husband Mohammad, and their two children, 14-year-old Fatima and 10-year-old Ali. The family appeared clean and well-groomed, despite the modest temporary housing conditions. The living space was small but tidy, with basic furniture and essential household items.

During our conversation, Aisha expressed gratitude for the accommodation but conveyed a sense of longing for permanent stability. Mohammad, though reserved, showed determination to improve their situation through language classes and job applications. Fatima and Ali appeared healthy and engaged, attending local school regularly. However, Fatima seemed withdrawn at times, possibly due to the stress of adapting to a new environment.

**Assessment:**

The family's moderate case severity is primarily driven by their temporary living situation and the ongoing challenges of integration into Finnish society. While they have access to basic needs, the lack of permanent housing and uncertainty about the future contribute to their stress levels. The children's school attendance is positive, but potential emotional concerns regarding Fatima warrant further exploration.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up:**

1. **Housing Support:** Coordinate with local authorities to expedite the search for permanent housing, ensuring it meets the family's needs and cultural considerations.
   
2. **Language and Cultural Integration Programs:** Enroll the family in Finnish language courses and cultural orientation sessions to enhance their integration into the community.

3. **Mental Health Assessment for Fatima:** Arrange a mental health evaluation for Fatima to address any potential emotional or behavioral issues stemming from acculturation stress.

4. **Youth Mentoring Program Participation:** Facilitate the family's participation in the youth mentoring program, focusing on Ali's development and providing peer support for Fatima.

5. **Follow-up Visit:** Schedule a follow-up visit within two months to reassess progress, address any emerging concerns, and adjust support strategies as necessary. 

This report aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the Khan family's situation, highlighting areas where targeted interventions can significantly improve their well-being and integration into Saarijärvi's community.
