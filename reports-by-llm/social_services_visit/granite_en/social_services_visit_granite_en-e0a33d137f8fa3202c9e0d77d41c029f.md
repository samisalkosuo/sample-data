---

**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This routine family wellbeing visit was conducted due to the reported early dementia symptoms exhibited by Aino Mäkelä, an elderly woman residing alone in Sotkamo, Finland. The urgent case severity necessitated immediate assessment and intervention to ensure her safety and wellbeing.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at Ms. Mäkelä's residence, I was greeted by a disorganized living space with signs of neglect, such as unwashed dishes and cluttered rooms. Ms. Mäkelä appeared confused and disoriented, struggling to recall recent events or provide coherent responses to simple questions. She exhibited repetitive behaviors, such as repeatedly opening and closing cabinet doors, indicating potential restlessness associated with her early dementia symptoms.

During our interaction, Ms. Mäkelä displayed an emotional state of mild agitation, which escalated when confronted with routine tasks like preparing a meal. Her inability to follow through on basic self-care activities raised concerns about her capacity to maintain her independence safely.

**Assessment**

The assessment revealed that Ms. Mäkelä's early dementia symptoms have progressed to a stage where she requires increased support and supervision to prevent potential risks, such as accidents due to confusion or neglect of personal hygiene and nutrition. The current living conditions are inadequate for her needs, posing health hazards like tripping hazards from clutter and risk of food poisoning from improperly stored food.

Family dynamics were assessed as limited, with no regular contact or involvement from adult children who reside in distant cities. This lack of support exacerbates the urgency of the situation, necessitating immediate intervention by social services to ensure Ms. Mäkelä's safety and wellbeing.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. **Immediate Home Assessment:** Arrange for a geriatric assessment team to evaluate Ms. Mäkelä's home environment for safety modifications and potential assistive devices.
   
2. **Cognitive Support:** Initiate cognitive stimulation therapy sessions, possibly through telehealth services, to help manage symptoms and slow further cognitive decline.

3. **Caregiver Training:** Provide training for family members on dementia care, focusing on communication strategies and practical support for Ms. Mäkelä's daily living activities.

4. **Regular Check-ins:** Schedule bi-weekly visits to monitor progress, address any emerging concerns, and adjust the support plan as necessary.

5. **Community Resources:** Connect Ms. Mäkelä with local dementia support groups and community resources in Sotkamo to foster social engagement and reduce feelings of isolation.

6. **Emergency Response Plan:** Develop an emergency response protocol with neighbors or local authorities to ensure prompt assistance in case of unforeseen incidents.

This report underscores the urgent need for comprehensive support to address Ms. Mäkelä's deteriorating condition and prevent further decline. Immediate action is crucial to safeguard her wellbeing and maintain her dignity within her own home environment.
