**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This homeless outreach visit was conducted to assess the living conditions and support needs of a teenage mother, Aino Mäkelä, her infant, and her parents residing together in Reisjärvi, Finland. The purpose was to evaluate their current situation, identify potential risks, and determine appropriate interventions given the moderate case severity.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at the Mäkelä household, I was greeted by Aino, her infant daughter Eeva (3 months), and her parents Jouko and Leena. The family resides in a small, modest apartment with limited space for their needs. The living conditions were clean but cramped, with essential items like clothing and baby supplies spread across the limited floor area.

Aino appeared tired yet attentive to her infant's needs. She expressed gratitude for the visit and shared that she is currently enrolled in a local vocational training program to improve her employment prospects. Her parents, Jouko (unemployed) and Leena (part-time retail worker), were supportive and engaged in caring for Eeva when Aino needed breaks.

Aino mentioned occasional stress due to financial constraints and the challenges of balancing her studies with parental responsibilities. She also expressed concerns about accessing childcare services, which are limited in their area.

**Assessment**

The family's moderate case severity stems from a combination of factors:
1. Aino's young age and single parenthood increase vulnerability to socioeconomic challenges.
2. Limited financial resources restrict access to essential childcare services, impacting Aino's ability to pursue her education and seek employment.
3. The cramped living conditions pose potential risks for the infant's development and well-being.
4. Although supportive, Jouko and Leena's limited income restricts their capacity to provide additional assistance beyond emotional and practical support to Aino.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. Connect Aino with local childcare services and financial assistance programs tailored for young parents to alleviate stress and enable her to focus on education and employment opportunities.
2. Facilitate a meeting between Aino and a social worker specializing in family support to discuss strategies for balancing parental responsibilities, studies, and potential employment.
3. Arrange a consultation with a pediatrician to ensure Eeva's developmental needs are met within the current living conditions.
4. Coordinate with community resources to explore options for expanding the Mäkelä household's living space or securing alternative accommodations if necessary.
5. Schedule a follow-up visit in four weeks to reassess progress, address any emerging concerns, and provide ongoing support.
