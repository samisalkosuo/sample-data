**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This post-hospital discharge visit was conducted for Aisha Khan and her family, who recently immigrated to Finland and were discharged from the hospital following a high-severity case. The purpose of this visit was to assess their living conditions, support needs, and overall well-being in their new environment.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at the modest apartment, Aisha greeted me warmly, expressing gratitude for the support. The children appeared healthy but were visibly anxious, clinging to their mother. The living conditions were basic, with limited furniture and household items. There was a noticeable language barrier, as Aisha's primary language is Urdu, and her understanding of Finnish remains rudimentary.

Aisha shared that they had been living in the apartment for three weeks following their hospital stay. She mentioned challenges with accessing healthcare information, navigating public transportation, and securing employment for Mohammad, who is still recovering from his illness. Aisha expressed deep concern about her children's integration into the local school system and their emotional well-being due to the recent upheaval.

**Assessment**

The family's recent immigration, coupled with a high-severity health event, places them at significant risk for social isolation, inadequate access to essential services, and potential mental health issues. The language barrier exacerbates these risks, hindering their ability to navigate the Finnish social service system effectively.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. **Language Support:** Arrange immediate access to a Finnish language tutor for Aisha and Mohammad to facilitate better communication and engagement with services.
2. **Healthcare Navigation:** Coordinate with the hospital's social worker to ensure ongoing medical follow-ups and medication management, addressing any potential misunderstandings due to language barriers.
3. **Employment Assistance:** Connect Mohammad with a local employment agency specializing in supporting immigrants, offering language classes and job placement services.
4. **Child Integration Support:** Liaise with the local municipality's education department to assist in enrolling the children in a Finnish language preschool and provide psychological support for their emotional adjustment.
5. **Community Linkage:** Introduce the family to a local immigrant support group to foster social connections and reduce feelings of isolation.
6. **Follow-up Visit:** Schedule a follow-up visit in two weeks to reassess progress, address emerging needs, and provide ongoing support.

This report underscores the urgent need for comprehensive, culturally sensitive interventions to ensure the Khan family's successful integration into Finnish society, mitigating identified risks and promoting their overall well-being.
