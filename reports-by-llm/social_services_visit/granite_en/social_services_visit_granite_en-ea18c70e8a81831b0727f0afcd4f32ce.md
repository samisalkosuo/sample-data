---

**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This homeless outreach visit was conducted due to a critical case severity level, indicating an urgent need for support. The teenage mother, Aino Mäkelä, along with her newborn, resides with her parents in Vöyri, Finland. The family's living conditions and the mother's ability to care for the infant are of significant concern.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at the modest apartment on Kauppakatu, I was greeted by Aino, her parents Jouko and Leena, and their grandchild. The living space was cramped, with limited furniture and essential items. Aino appeared fatigued but attentive to her infant's needs. Her parents seemed supportive yet overwhelmed by the situation.

Aino expressed difficulty managing daily tasks due to lack of privacy and resources. She also mentioned feeling isolated from peers and community support networks. The emotional strain was evident, with Aino displaying signs of anxiety and stress.

**Assessment**

The family's critical case severity is primarily driven by the young age of the mother, limited living space, and scarce resources. Aino's mental health appears to be deteriorating under the pressure of single parenthood and financial constraints. The lack of a stable income and inadequate support systems exacerbates their vulnerability.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. Immediate referral to a local mental health service for Aino to address her anxiety and stress, ensuring her emotional well-being supports effective parenting.
   
2. Connection with a social worker specializing in youth pregnancy to provide guidance and resources tailored to Aino's situation.

3. Assessment by child protective services to ensure the infant's needs are met and to monitor the family dynamics closely.

4. Facilitation of access to financial assistance programs, parenting classes, and potential employment support for Aino to achieve greater independence.

5. Scheduled follow-up visit within one week to reassess progress and adjust interventions as necessary. 

This report underscores the urgency of the situation and the need for swift, comprehensive support to prevent further deterioration of the family's circumstances.
