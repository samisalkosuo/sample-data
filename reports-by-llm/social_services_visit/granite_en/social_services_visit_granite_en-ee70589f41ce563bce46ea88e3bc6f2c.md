**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted to evaluate the suitability and effectiveness of the current foster family setup for a teenager experiencing school attendance issues. The purpose was to assess the living conditions, family dynamics, and overall support provided to ensure the teenager's well-being and academic progress.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at Aino Mäkelä's residence in Sipoo, the environment appeared clean, organized, and safe for a teenager. The foster parents, Antero and Aino Mäkelä, were warm and welcoming. They provided clear explanations regarding their approach to supporting the teenager, emphasizing open communication and encouragement towards education.

The teenager, 15-year-old Eeva, was present during the conversation. She appeared calm but somewhat withdrawn. When discussing school, Eeva acknowledged her struggles with attendance, citing feelings of anxiety and difficulty in keeping up with coursework. The foster parents reported noticing these changes and have been proactive in seeking support from local educational resources.

**Assessment**

The family dynamics seem positive and supportive. Antero and Aino Mäkelä demonstrated a genuine interest in Eeva's development, actively engaging with school staff to address her attendance issues. There are no immediate safety concerns or signs of neglect or abuse. The case severity is considered low due to the stable home environment and the family’s willingness to collaborate with educational institutions.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. **Educational Support:** Arrange a meeting with Eeva's school counselor and teachers to develop a tailored plan addressing her anxiety and academic challenges, possibly including additional tutoring or study skills workshops.
   
2. **Mental Health Evaluation:** Schedule a referral for a mental health assessment to explore the root causes of Eeva's school-related anxiety and provide appropriate interventions if necessary.

3. **Regular Check-ins:** Maintain bi-monthly visits to monitor progress, offer ongoing support to the foster family, and ensure that Eeva’s needs are consistently met.

4. **Family Support Group:** Encourage participation in a local support group for foster families to share experiences and learn from others facing similar challenges.

This report reflects a single evaluation point. Continued collaboration with all parties involved is crucial for Eeva's successful integration into her educational environment and overall well-being within the foster care setting.
