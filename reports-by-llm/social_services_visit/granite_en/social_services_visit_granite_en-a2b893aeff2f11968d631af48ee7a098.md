---

**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This follow-up visit was conducted due to a prior report concerning the truancy of Aapo Soini, a young adult who is transitioning out of the foster care system. The high severity of this case necessitates ongoing monitoring to ensure Aapo's well-being and educational progress.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at the designated address, I was greeted by Aapo Soini, who appeared to be in his early twenties. He seemed withdrawn and hesitant during our interaction, which lasted approximately 45 minutes. The living conditions were minimal but adequate, suggesting recent relocation or transition into independent housing. There was evidence of some emotional distress, as Aapo displayed signs of anxiety, such as fidgeting and avoiding eye contact.

During our conversation, Aapo disclosed that he had been struggling with attending school due to feelings of isolation and lack of support in navigating adult responsibilities post-foster care. He expressed a desire for further education but felt overwhelmed by the prospect of managing both work and studies simultaneously.

**Assessment**

Aapo's situation presents significant challenges, primarily due to his recent transition from foster care into independent living without robust support systems in place. The truancy is indicative of deeper issues such as mental health concerns and a lack of coping strategies for adult life transitions. There are evident risks related to social isolation, potential employment instability, and the possibility of further educational disengagement. Family dynamics are non-existent in the traditional sense, with Aapo having limited contact with former foster families and no known kin support.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. **Mental Health Support:** Arrange for Aapo to engage with a counselor specializing in post-foster care transition issues to address his anxiety and develop coping mechanisms.

2. **Educational Guidance:** Connect Aapo with an educational advisor who can assist in exploring flexible learning options, such as part-time study or vocational training, to accommodate work commitments.

3. **Peer Support Network:** Facilitate Aapo's integration into a peer support group for young adults who have aged out of foster care to combat feelings of isolation and provide a sense of community.

4. **Regular Check-ins:** Schedule bi-weekly visits over the next three months to monitor progress, adjust support strategies as needed, and offer ongoing encouragement and resources.

5. **Employment Assistance:** Collaborate with local employment services to help Aapo secure part-time work or an apprenticeship that aligns with his interests and skills, providing structure and financial independence.

This comprehensive approach aims to mitigate the identified risks and support Aapo's successful transition into adulthood, ensuring he maintains educational engagement and develops necessary life skills for sustainable independence.
