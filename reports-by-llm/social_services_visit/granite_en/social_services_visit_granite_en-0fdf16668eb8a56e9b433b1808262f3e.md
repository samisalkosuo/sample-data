---

**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted as a newborn and infant safety check due to the critical case severity. The primary focus was to assess the living conditions, parental capabilities, and overall family dynamics to ensure the safety and well-being of the newborn and the three other young children in the household.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival, the residence appeared cluttered with limited space for movement. The parents, Aino (32) and Jussi Mäkelä (35), seemed overwhelmed and exhausted. They expressed difficulty managing their children's needs due to inadequate sleeping arrangements and insufficient resources.

The newborn was sharing a room with the 1-year-old, both in a makeshift crib lacking proper safety features. The older children were left unsupervised for extended periods while their parents attended to the infants' needs. Aino appeared anxious and emotionally distressed, while Jussi seemed withdrawn and non-responsive to the immediate concerns raised during the visit.

**Assessment**

The living conditions pose significant risks to the children's safety, particularly the newborn. The lack of proper sleeping arrangements, limited access to essential baby supplies, and insufficient supervision for older children indicate a critical situation requiring urgent intervention. Family dynamics suggest potential neglect due to parental stress and fatigue, exacerbated by inadequate support systems.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. Immediate provision of safe sleeping arrangements for all children, including a proper crib for the newborn, ensuring compliance with safety standards.
2. Referral to local parenting support groups and resources focused on infant care and child development.
3. Arrangement for regular home visits by a social worker to monitor progress, offer ongoing support, and address any emerging concerns.
4. Connection with community health services for pediatric check-ups and well-child care for all children.
5. Assessment for family counseling or mental health support services to address parental stress and emotional well-being.
6. Follow-up visit scheduled in one week to reassess the situation and ensure implemented recommendations are being adhered to.

This critical case necessitates swift, coordinated action from multiple support services to safeguard the welfare of all children within this household.
