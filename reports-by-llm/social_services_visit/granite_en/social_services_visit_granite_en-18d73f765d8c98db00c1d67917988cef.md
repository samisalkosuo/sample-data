---

**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted due to an urgent referral regarding an unaccompanied minor residing in temporary housing in Kalajoki, Finland. The case severity was deemed critical, necessitating immediate assessment and intervention.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at Aino M채kel채's temporary accommodation, I observed a 15-year-old girl, Anna, residing alone. The living conditions were minimal, with basic furnishings and limited personal belongings. Anna appeared withdrawn and anxious during our interaction. She expressed feelings of isolation and fear, mentioning occasional disturbances from neighboring tenants. There were no signs of abuse or neglect; however, the lack of a stable support system is a significant concern.

**Assessment**

Anna's situation presents critical risks due to her unaccompanied minor status and the absence of a stable support network. The temporary housing arrangement, while providing immediate shelter, does not address her long-term needs for emotional well-being, education, and social integration. The lack of adult supervision increases vulnerability to exploitation and neglect.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. Immediate referral to the Finnish Social Insurance Institution (Kela) for financial assistance to ensure basic needs are met.
2. Collaboration with local child protective services to establish a legal guardianship arrangement.
3. Connection with a mental health professional specializing in supporting unaccompanied minors to address emotional distress and provide coping strategies.
4. Enrollment in a local educational program to ensure continuity of schooling and social interaction opportunities.
5. Arrange a follow-up visit within one week to monitor progress and adjust support plans as necessary.
6. Explore long-term housing options, potentially including foster care or group homes, to provide a stable environment conducive to her development and safety.
