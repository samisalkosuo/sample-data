---

**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted as part of an urgent refugee integration support case in Mustasaari, Helsinki. The primary purpose was to assess the living conditions and well-being of an 8-year-old child residing with their non-custodial relative, following a recent separation from their custodial parent. Given the urgency of the situation, the visit aimed to identify immediate needs and potential risks to ensure the child's safety and facilitate their integration into Finnish society.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at Anna Korhonen's residence, I was greeted by the child, who appeared well-groomed but visibly anxious. The living conditions were modest yet clean and safe, with basic necessities provided. The grandmother, Anna's mother, was present and cooperative, expressing concern for her grandchild's emotional state post-separation.

During our conversation, the child expressed difficulty adjusting to their new environment, missing their parent, and struggling with language barriers. The grandmother acknowledged these challenges but lacked resources or knowledge of available support services tailored for refugee children. She expressed a strong desire to help her grandchild but felt overwhelmed by the situation.

**Assessment**

The child's emotional distress and the grandmother's limited capacity to address these needs indicate an urgent case requiring immediate intervention. The language barrier further complicates the child's integration process, potentially impacting their educational progress and social development. The absence of a supportive network within the local community exacerbates the situation, necessitating external assistance.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. **Immediate Language Support:** Arrange for an urgent language assessment and enroll the child in a Finnish language course tailored for young learners. This will facilitate communication and integration into the local school system.

2. **Psychological Evaluation:** Schedule a psychological evaluation to assess the child's emotional well-being and provide appropriate counseling services to address separation anxiety and acculturation stress.

3. **Family Support Group:** Connect the grandmother with a support group for non-custodial relatives of refugee children, offering guidance on navigating integration challenges and accessing available resources.

4. **Regular Follow-up Visits:** Plan bi-weekly visits to monitor progress, address emerging concerns, and adjust intervention strategies as needed. The next follow-up is scheduled for 14.07.2025.

5. **Community Engagement:** Collaborate with local community centers and refugee support organizations to foster a sense of belonging and provide opportunities for the child to engage with peers from similar backgrounds.

By implementing these recommendations, we aim to mitigate immediate risks, enhance the child's integration prospects, and empower the grandmother to effectively support her grandchild during this critical period.
