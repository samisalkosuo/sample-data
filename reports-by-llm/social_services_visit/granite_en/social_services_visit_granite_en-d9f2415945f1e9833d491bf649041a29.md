**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This at-risk youth intervention visit was conducted due to concerns regarding the wellbeing and safety of the minor, 16-year-old Mika Korhonen, residing with his elderly parents, Aino (72) and Jussi (75), in Urjala, Finland. The case severity is deemed critical due to reports of neglect, emotional distress, and potential exposure to harmful influences within the household.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at the Korhonen residence, I was greeted by Aino and Jussi, who appeared frail and disoriented. The living conditions were substandard, with clutter and signs of neglected maintenance throughout the home. Mika was present but remained distant and unresponsive during introductions.

During our conversation, Aino and Jussi displayed confusion and difficulty in recalling recent events, suggesting cognitive decline. Mika's emotional state appeared withdrawn and anxious, evident through his furtive glances and avoidance of eye contact. He mentioned feeling overwhelmed by household responsibilities following the deterioration of his parents' health.

Notable concerns include:
1. Inadequate supervision and care for Mika due to his parents' cognitive impairment.
2. Evidence of unmet basic needs, such as untidy living conditions and potential food insecurity.
3. Mika's admission to engaging with peers involved in substance abuse, indicating a risk of similar behaviors.

**Assessment**

The assessment reveals a critical situation where the elderly parents are unable to provide essential care and support for their minor son. The household dynamics are strained, with Mika shouldering excessive responsibilities beyond his developmental stage. His emotional distress and potential exposure to substance abuse pose significant risks to his wellbeing and future prospects.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. Immediate referral to adult protective services for Aino and Jussi to address their cognitive decline and ensure their safety.
2. Engagement of a youth support worker to provide counseling and guidance for Mika, focusing on emotional wellbeing and coping strategies.
3. Collaboration with local schools and community centers to monitor Mika's academic performance and social integration, identifying any further needs or interventions.
4. Arrangement of regular home visits by social services to assess progress, provide ongoing support, and ensure the safety and wellbeing of Mika within his current living environment.
5. Consideration of alternative care arrangements if the parents' health continues to deteriorate and poses a risk to Mika's development and safety.

This report will be shared with relevant stakeholders, including adult protective services, youth support agencies, and local educational institutions, to facilitate coordinated and comprehensive intervention for the Korhonen family. Further updates will be provided following implementation of recommended actions and subsequent visits.
