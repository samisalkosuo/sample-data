---

**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted as a routine juvenile probation compliance check, given the minor's prior involvement in low-level delinquency. The purpose was to assess the living conditions and family dynamics, ensuring adherence to probation terms and providing necessary support to mitigate potential risks associated with financial hardship.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at Aino Mäkelä's residence in Laukaa, a multi-generational household comprising Aino (grandmother), her adult daughter Sari (mother of the minor), and their teenage grandson Leo was present. The home appeared tidy, though modestly furnished, reflecting financial constraints.

Leo, the 15-year-old subject of the probation, greeted the social worker politely. He seemed engaged in his schoolwork, demonstrating a positive behavioral shift since the last visit. Sari was preparing dinner, showing active involvement in household chores. Aino appeared content and supportive, emphasizing her commitment to Leo's rehabilitation.

There were no immediate concerns regarding safety or neglect. The family's low-severity case indicates a stable environment with minimal risk factors, primarily centered around financial stressors that could impact Leo’s opportunities and peer influences.

**Assessment**

The assessment reveals a supportive multi-generational household where Aino and Sari actively engage in Leo's upbringing despite financial limitations. The current living conditions, while modest, do not pose an immediate risk to Leo’s well-being or compliance with probation terms.

The primary concern remains the potential for increased delinquency due to social exclusion stemming from their economic situation. It is crucial to address this indirect risk factor to prevent any escalation in behavior.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. **Financial Counseling Referral:** Arrange a session with a local financial advisor to help the family manage their resources more effectively and explore potential assistance programs available for low-income families in Laukaa.
   
2. **Community Engagement Program:** Encourage participation in community activities or clubs that can provide Leo with positive peer interactions, reducing the likelihood of engaging in delinquent behavior due to social isolation.

3. **Regular Follow-up Visits:** Schedule bi-monthly visits to monitor progress, offer ongoing support, and adjust interventions as necessary, ensuring continued compliance with probation terms and addressing any emerging concerns promptly.

This report underscores the family's resilience and commitment to Leo’s successful reintegration into society. With targeted support, the risk of recidivism can be minimized, allowing Leo to thrive within his community.
