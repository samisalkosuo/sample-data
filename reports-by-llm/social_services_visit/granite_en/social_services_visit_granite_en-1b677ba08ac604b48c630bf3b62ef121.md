**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted as a follow-up to the recent domestic relocation of sisters Aino (45) and Anna Koskinen. The purpose was to assess their adaptation to the new residence, ensure their wellbeing, and address any emerging concerns following their move from Helsinki to Kumlinge.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at the Koskinen sisters' new home in Kumlinge, both appeared content and settled. The living conditions were adequate, with cleanliness maintained throughout the modest apartment. Aino, who uses a wheelchair due to mobility issues, expressed satisfaction with the accessible features of their new dwelling. Anna, a part-time caregiver, seemed relieved by the reduced noise pollution and increased privacy compared to their previous urban residence.

During conversation, both sisters demonstrated a positive emotional state, engaging in light-hearted banter and sharing stories about their new community involvement. There were no immediate signs of distress or significant behavioral changes noted. The sisters mentioned joining local senior groups and expressed interest in volunteering at the nearby community center.

**Assessment**

The Koskinen sisters' transition to Kumlinge appears smooth, with low-risk factors identified. Their new environment seems conducive to their physical and emotional wellbeing, offering a quieter, more accessible setting than their previous urban dwelling. Family dynamics remain supportive, with both sisters actively participating in community life, which is beneficial for their mental health.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

Given the low case severity and positive observations, further visits are recommended on a quarterly basis to monitor ongoing adjustment and address any potential emerging needs. It would be prudent to connect the sisters with local support groups specifically for seniors and those with mobility challenges to foster continued social engagement.

Anna Koskinen, as the more active sibling, could benefit from exploring opportunities for part-time work or volunteer roles that align with her caregiving skills, potentially enhancing her sense of purpose and financial stability. 

In summary, while the sisters' relocation has been successful thus far, ongoing support in integrating into their new community and maintaining social connections will be crucial for sustained wellbeing. The next follow-up visit is scheduled for 07.09.2025.
