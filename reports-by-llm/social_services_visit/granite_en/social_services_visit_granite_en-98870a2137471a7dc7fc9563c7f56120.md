**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted as part of an at-risk youth intervention, focusing on a household in Pello where grandparents are the primary caregivers for their grandchildren. The purpose was to assess the living conditions, family dynamics, and overall well-being of the children under the grandparents' care, given the low severity case indication.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at Aino Korhonen's residence, I observed a modest, clean, and organized home environment. The grandparents, Aino (65) and her husband Jussi (70), appeared healthy and engaged. They were warm and welcoming, with clear affection for their three grandchildren: 12-year-old Anna, 10-year-old Elias, and 7-year-old Oliver.

The children seemed well-adjusted, actively participating in daily chores and engaging in age-appropriate activities. Anna was seen helping with meal preparation, Elias was reading a schoolbook, and Oliver was playing quietly with toys. Their emotional states appeared positive, with occasional playful interactions amongst themselves and with their grandparents.

Notable concerns included limited social interaction outside the immediate family due to Pello's remote location and harsh winter conditions. Additionally, there was a lack of access to organized extracurricular activities or peer groups, which could impact the children's social development.

**Assessment**

The current situation presents a low-severity case, with grandparents demonstrating capable caregiving skills and a nurturing home environment. The children's physical needs are met, and they exhibit positive emotional expressions. However, the limited social engagement outside the family unit warrants attention to prevent potential isolation or developmental delays.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. **Community Engagement:** Encourage participation in local community activities or clubs that can provide opportunities for social interaction and skill development.
2. **Educational Support:** Liaise with the local school to ensure any educational needs are addressed, including access to tutoring or enrichment programs if necessary.
3. **Health Check-up:** Schedule a comprehensive health check-up for all children to monitor their developmental milestones and address any emerging concerns proactively.
4. **Follow-up Visit:** Plan a follow-up visit in three months to reassess social integration efforts and the children's progress in extracurricular activities.

This report reflects a professional evaluation of the Korhonen household, highlighting areas of strength while identifying opportunities for support to maintain and enhance the well-being of the grandchildren under their care.
