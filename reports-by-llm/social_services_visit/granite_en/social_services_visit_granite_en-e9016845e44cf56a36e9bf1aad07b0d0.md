**Social Services Visit Report**

*Client Name:* Aino & Anna Mäkelä
*Address:* Kauppakatu 12, Evijärvi, Finland
*Visit Date:* 05.03.2025
*Visit Type:* Parenting education follow-up
*Case Severity:* Moderate

**Summary of Visit Purpose:**
This visit was conducted as a follow-up to the parenting education program for Aino and Anna Mäkelä, two adult siblings sharing housing in Evijärvi, Finland. The purpose was to assess their progress in applying learned parenting skills and to identify any ongoing needs or concerns that may require additional support.

**Observations During the Visit:**
Aino and Anna welcomed the social worker into their shared home, which appeared clean and organized. They displayed a moderate level of engagement during the conversation, demonstrating some understanding of the parenting strategies discussed in the education program. The sisters reported implementing techniques such as positive reinforcement and consistent discipline, though they acknowledged occasional challenges in maintaining these practices due to their shared living arrangements and work schedules.

The emotional state of both Aino and Anna seemed stable, with no immediate signs of distress or crisis. However, there were notable concerns regarding the sisters' ability to provide adequate one-on-one attention to their children, given their limited personal space and shared responsibilities.

**Assessment:**
The assessment indicates that Aino and Anna have made some progress in applying parenting education principles; however, the moderate case severity suggests ongoing challenges. The sisters' shared living situation and demanding work schedules contribute to difficulties in providing consistent, individualized care for their children. There is a risk of insufficient attention leading to behavioral issues or emotional neglect in the children.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up:**
1. Continue bi-weekly home visits to provide ongoing support and troubleshoot specific parenting challenges as they arise.
2. Refer Aino and Anna to a local sibling counseling service to address potential dynamics affecting their shared caregiving responsibilities and personal boundaries.
3. Encourage participation in a parent-child playgroup, facilitating opportunities for Aino and Anna to practice their skills in a supervised setting with peer support.
4. Schedule a review visit in four months to reassess progress and adjust the support plan as necessary.

This report reflects a professional evaluation of the situation, emphasizing the need for continued support to address the identified concerns and promote the well-being of both the adult siblings and their children.
