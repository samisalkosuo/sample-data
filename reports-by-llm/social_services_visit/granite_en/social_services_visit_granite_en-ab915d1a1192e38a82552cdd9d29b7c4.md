**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted to assess the disability support needs of Aino Mäkelä, a single adult residing in Eckerö, Finland. The purpose was to evaluate her living conditions, functional abilities, and identify any potential support requirements to ensure her well-being and independence are maintained at an optimal level.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at Aino's apartment located on Kauppakatu, I found a clean, organized space that reflected her diligent approach to maintaining her living environment despite her physical disability. Aino, who uses a wheelchair, was present and welcoming. She communicated clearly, expressing gratitude for the visit and indicating a desire to remain independent in her home.

During our interaction, Aino demonstrated proficiency in managing daily activities such as personal care, meal preparation, and basic household chores with adaptive equipment provided by previous support services. Her emotional state was positive, showing resilience and a proactive attitude towards managing her disability. There were no immediate concerns regarding safety or well-being observed.

**Assessment**

Given Aino's single status and low case severity, her current living situation appears stable and supportive of her needs. She has access to necessary adaptive equipment and shows competence in self-care and managing household tasks. The absence of significant behavioral or emotional issues suggests a low risk environment. However, it is noted that while Aino's immediate needs are met, ongoing support could enhance her quality of life and prevent potential future challenges as she ages in place.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. **Continued Home Support Services:** Maintain current levels of home care services to ensure Aino can continue managing her daily activities independently. Schedule periodic check-ins to assess the effectiveness of adaptive equipment and make necessary adjustments.

2. **Community Integration Activities:** Encourage participation in local community programs designed for individuals with disabilities to foster social interaction and reduce isolation.

3. **Health Monitoring:** Arrange for regular health check-ups with a specialist focusing on managing her disability, ensuring any emerging needs are addressed promptly.

4. **Future Planning Workshop:** Organize a workshop focused on long-term planning, including discussions around potential future support needs and available resources in Eckerö to assist with maintaining independence as Aino's circumstances may evolve over time.

Next follow-up visit is scheduled for 22.02.2025 to reassess her situation and the effectiveness of implemented recommendations. 

This report concludes with a positive outlook on Aino Mäkelä’s current support needs, emphasizing proactive measures to sustain her independence and community integration.
