---

**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted to assess the disability support needs of a teenager currently residing in foster care due to high case severity. The purpose was to evaluate the living conditions, interactions, behaviors, emotional state, and identify any notable concerns that may impact the teenager's well-being and development.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at Aino Mäkelä's foster home in Jämijärvi, the teenager, 15-year-old Eeva, was present along with her designated foster parent, Mr. Mikko Koskinen. The living environment appeared clean and organized, with age-appropriate toys and educational materials visible.

Eeva displayed a quiet demeanor during the initial interaction, responding minimally to questions. She spent most of the visit engaged in a tablet-based learning activity, demonstrating some focus but also exhibiting signs of restlessness and occasional frustration. Mr. Koskinen reported that Eeva has been diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), which impact her social interactions and concentration.

**Assessment**

The assessment revealed a high-severity case due to Eeva's complex needs stemming from her ASD and ADHD diagnoses. Her limited verbal communication and difficulty in maintaining eye contact suggest challenges in social interaction, a core symptom of ASD. The reported hyperactivity and impulsivity further align with an ADHD diagnosis.

The foster parent, Mr. Koskinen, expressed concerns about Eeva's emotional outbursts and difficulties adapting to new routines or changes in her environment. These behaviors pose risks to Eeva's emotional well-being and the stability of the foster home. The current support system, including school and occasional therapy sessions, seems insufficient to manage her needs effectively.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. **Specialized Therapeutic Intervention:** Arrange for increased frequency and intensity of occupational therapy and behavioral therapy sessions tailored to address Eeva's specific challenges related to ASD and ADHD.

2. **Educational Support:** Collaborate with Eeva's school to implement a comprehensive Individualized Education Program (IEP) that includes strategies for managing her symptoms, improving focus, and fostering social skills.

3. **Family Counseling:** Initiate family counseling sessions for Mr. Koskinen and Eeva to enhance communication, provide strategies for managing challenging behaviors, and strengthen the parent-child relationship.

4. **Regular Monitoring:** Schedule bi-monthly follow-up visits to monitor progress, adjust interventions as necessary, and ensure the ongoing support of Mr. Koskinen in Eeva's care.

5. **Case Review:** Conduct a comprehensive case review with all involved parties (foster parent, school, therapists) within three months to reassess needs and refine the support plan accordingly.

This report underscores the urgency for a multifaceted approach to address Eeva's high-severity case effectively, ensuring her developmental, emotional, and social needs are met with appropriate and timely interventions.
