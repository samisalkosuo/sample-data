---

**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted to provide substance abuse support for a teenager residing in Pirkkala, Finland, experiencing school attendance issues. The primary objective was to assess the situation, offer guidance, and connect the family with relevant resources to address the identified concerns.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at Aino Pirkkala's residence, I was greeted by her mother, Maija, who appeared anxious but cooperative. The living conditions were clean and organized, with a comfortable environment for the family. Aino, a 15-year-old girl, was present during the visit. She seemed withdrawn and reserved, occasionally avoiding eye contact. Maija shared that Aino's school attendance has been inconsistent over the past few months, which she attributes to peer pressure and substance use among her friends.

**Assessment**

The case severity is considered low due to the absence of severe neglect or immediate danger. However, there are notable concerns regarding Aino's substance use and its impact on her school attendance. Maija expressed a lack of understanding about the signs of substance abuse and how to address it effectively. The family appears supportive but requires guidance and education to navigate this challenging situation.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. Schedule a family counseling session with a local mental health professional specializing in adolescent substance abuse to provide education, support, and coping strategies for both Maija and Aino.
2. Connect the family with a peer support group focused on adolescents dealing with substance use issues, fostering a sense of community and shared experiences.
3. Arrange a follow-up visit in four weeks to assess progress, address any emerging concerns, and adjust the support plan as necessary.
4. Encourage Maija to attend parenting workshops offered by local social services to enhance her understanding of adolescent development and effective communication strategies.
