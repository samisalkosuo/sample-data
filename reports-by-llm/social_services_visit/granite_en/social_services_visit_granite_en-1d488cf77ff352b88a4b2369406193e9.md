**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This follow-up visit was conducted due to a reported case of school truancy involving Aino Mäkelä's children in Rautalampi, Finland. The initial report indicated potential links between the parent's substance use disorder and the children's attendance at school. This visit aimed to assess the current family situation, evaluate the impact on the children, and determine if additional support is required.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at Aino Mäkelä's residence, the living conditions appeared tidy and organized, suggesting some level of effort towards maintaining a stable environment despite the parent's substance use disorder. Aino was present during the visit and appeared cooperative, expressing concern over her children's recent school absences.

During our conversation, Aino acknowledged her ongoing struggle with alcohol dependency but reported attending regular support group meetings as part of her recovery process. She emphasized her commitment to improving her situation for the sake of her children. The children, aged 10 and 13, were present and engaged in quiet activities during our discussion with their mother. They appeared healthy and well-nourished, showing no signs of neglect or immediate distress.

**Assessment**

The case severity is currently low, primarily due to Aino's acknowledgment of her issues and active participation in recovery efforts. The children do not appear to be at imminent risk, although their school attendance remains a concern. It is crucial to monitor the situation closely to ensure that Aino's progress continues and that her children's educational needs are met without further disruptions.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. Encourage Aino to maintain her engagement with support groups and consider additional therapy sessions to strengthen her recovery and parenting skills.
2. Arrange a meeting between Aino, school authorities, and the children's teachers to discuss strategies for improving school attendance and addressing any underlying issues affecting the children's motivation or behavior.
3. Schedule a follow-up visit in four weeks to reassess the family situation, monitor Aino's progress, and evaluate the effectiveness of implemented support measures.
4. Provide information about local parenting classes and resources that could benefit Aino in her journey towards stable recovery and improved family dynamics.

This report will be shared with relevant stakeholders, including school authorities and substance abuse treatment providers, to ensure a coordinated approach in supporting the Mäkelä family.
