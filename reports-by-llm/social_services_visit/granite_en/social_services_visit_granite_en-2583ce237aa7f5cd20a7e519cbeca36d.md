**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted to assess the risk of domestic violence in a transitional housing setting for Aino Mäkelä, who recently completed rehabilitation. The purpose was to evaluate the current living conditions, family dynamics, and potential risks within the household.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at Kalevantie 12, I was greeted by Aino Mäkelä, who appeared calm and composed. The transitional housing facility was clean and well-maintained, with a communal living area, kitchen, and individual rooms for residents. During our conversation, Aino expressed gratitude for the support provided during her rehabilitation process. She reported positive interactions with staff and fellow residents, noting a sense of community and mutual respect.

Aino's emotional state seemed stable, with no signs of distress or anxiety. She mentioned having separated from her previous partner two years ago due to past incidents of verbal abuse. Aino emphasized that she has not had any contact with her ex-partner since the separation and is currently focused on rebuilding her life.

**Assessment**

Given Aino's history of verbal abuse and her successful completion of rehabilitation, the case severity is classified as low. There are no immediate concerns regarding domestic violence, as she has maintained a safe distance from her ex-partner. The transitional housing environment appears supportive and conducive to her well-being and personal growth.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

Aino should continue engaging in individual counseling sessions to address any lingering emotional effects from past experiences. It is recommended that she participate in a local support group for survivors of domestic violence to foster connections and share experiences with others who have undergone similar challenges.

A follow-up visit is scheduled in three months to assess her progress, reevaluate the risk level, and address any emerging concerns. In the meantime, Aino should be encouraged to reach out to social services if she encounters any difficulties or requires additional support.
