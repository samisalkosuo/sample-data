---

**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted to assess the needs and circumstances of an unaccompanied minor, Anna Pörnninen, residing in temporary housing in Pornainen, Finland. The purpose was to evaluate her living conditions, emotional state, and identify any immediate risks or support requirements, given the moderate case severity.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at Anna's temporary accommodation, a clean and modestly furnished one-bedroom apartment, I was greeted by the 14-year-old girl. She appeared well-groomed but displayed signs of anxiety, fidgeting and avoiding eye contact. Anna informed me that she had been living alone for three months following her parents' separation and subsequent return to their home country.

The living conditions were adequate, with basic necessities provided by the temporary housing agency. However, there was a noticeable lack of personal belongings or photographs, suggesting a possible emotional disconnect from her previous life. Anna expressed a desire for more social interaction and engagement in extracurricular activities, which are currently limited due to her isolated living situation.

**Assessment**

Anna's case presents moderate severity due to the duration of her unaccompanied status and the emotional impact evident during our interaction. While her immediate physical needs are met, there is a risk of further emotional deterioration without appropriate support. The absence of family or friends in Finland exacerbates this concern.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. **Counseling Services:** Arrange for Anna to begin individual counseling sessions with a mental health professional specializing in supporting unaccompanied minors. This should commence within one week to address her emotional well-being promptly.

2. **Educational Support:** Liaise with local schools to facilitate Anna's enrollment, ensuring any language barriers or educational gaps are addressed. A follow-up visit in two weeks will assess her integration into the school environment.

3. **Social Integration:** Connect Anna with youth groups or clubs that offer opportunities for social engagement and skill development. This should be arranged within a month to foster a sense of community and belonging.

4. **Regular Check-ins:** Schedule bi-weekly visits over the next three months to monitor Anna's progress, adjust support as necessary, and maintain open communication regarding any emerging needs or concerns.

This report serves as an initial evaluation; ongoing assessment will be crucial in ensuring Anna's well-being and successful integration into Finnish society.
