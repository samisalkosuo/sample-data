**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted as a routine check-in for Jari Pietilä, a veteran with a documented history of substance use disorder, residing in Viitasaari, Finland. The purpose was to assess the current living conditions, evaluate the impact of the parent's substance use on the household, and provide necessary support and resources.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at Jari Pietilä's residence, the home appeared tidy, but there were signs of recent disturbance, suggesting potential instability. Jari was present and cooperative during the visit. He displayed physical signs consistent with substance use, such as bloodshot eyes and unsteady gait. The children, aged 8 and 12, were well-groomed but appeared anxious and withdrawn.

Jari acknowledged his ongoing struggle with substance use and expressed concern for the children's well-being. He mentioned attending a local support group meeting once a week but admitted to relapsing during other times. The children disclosed feeling scared when their parent was under the influence and expressed a desire for more stability in their lives.

**Assessment**

The high case severity is primarily due to Jari's unaddressed substance use disorder, which poses significant risks to his health and the emotional well-being of his children. The children's anxiety and fear during the visit indicate a need for immediate intervention to ensure their safety and stability.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. Immediate referral to an intensive outpatient treatment program specializing in veteran substance use disorders.
2. Arrangement for regular, supervised visits by a social worker to monitor Jari's progress and provide additional support to the children.
3. Connection with local parenting classes focused on addressing the impact of substance use on family dynamics.
4. Coordination with child protective services to ensure the children's safety and well-being, including potential placement in a temporary foster home if necessary.
5. Schedule a follow-up visit within two weeks to reassess Jari's progress and adjust support strategies accordingly.
