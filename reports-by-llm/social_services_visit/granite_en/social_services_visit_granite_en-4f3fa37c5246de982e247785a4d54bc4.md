**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted as part of a routine juvenile probation compliance check for the Khan family, who are currently residing in temporary accommodation following their recent arrival as refugees in Punkalaidun, Finland. The purpose was to assess the family's adherence to probation conditions, evaluate living conditions, and identify any emerging needs or concerns that may impact the well-being of the juvenile member under probation.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at the temporary accommodation center, I was greeted by Aisha Khan, the mother, along with her teenage son, Mohammed (16 years). The living conditions were basic but clean and organized. There was evidence of efforts to create a homely environment within the limited space.

During our conversation, Aisha expressed gratitude for the support received but also conveyed stress related to their uncertain future and integration into Finnish society. Mohammed appeared quiet and reserved, engaging minimally with both his mother and me. He confirmed attendance at school as required by his probation conditions and mentioned participating in a local youth program aimed at skill development.

**Assessment**

The family appears to be compliant with the probation conditions thus far, with Mohammed consistently attending school and engaging in community programs. However, there are moderate concerns regarding Mohammed's emotional state, characterized by noticeable withdrawal and reluctance to social interaction, which could indicate underlying issues such as acculturation stress or potential mental health needs.

The family’s temporary status contributes to a sense of instability, which might exacerbate these concerns. While Aisha is actively seeking employment and language training, the lack of permanent housing adds pressure and uncertainty, potentially impacting Mohammed's adjustment and behavior.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. **Mental Health Assessment:** Given Mohammed’s withdrawn behavior, it is recommended that he undergo a mental health assessment to address any potential emotional or psychological issues stemming from acculturation stress or other factors.

2. **Continued Support Services:** Aisha should be encouraged to continue her language and vocational training, with additional support provided to navigate the Finnish employment market and housing options for a more stable future.

3. **Community Integration Programs:** Encourage Mohammed's participation in more structured community integration programs that could foster social connections and provide peer support.

4. **Follow-up Visit:** Schedule a follow-up visit within four weeks to reassess progress, address any emerging needs, and offer ongoing support as the family navigates their transition period. 

This report will be shared with the probation officer overseeing Mohammed's case for coordinated action and to ensure comprehensive care for this vulnerable juvenile within the context of his family’s refugee status.
