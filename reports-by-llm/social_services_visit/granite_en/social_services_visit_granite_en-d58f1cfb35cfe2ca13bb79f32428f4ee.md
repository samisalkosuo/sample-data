**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted to assess the needs and living conditions of an unaccompanied minor, 14-year-old Anna Koski, following her parents' separation and their decision to share custody. The purpose was to evaluate the family dynamics, identify any immediate risks or concerns, and establish a support plan for Anna's wellbeing during this transitional period.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at Aino Koski's residence, I observed a relatively tidy and organized living space, suggesting an effort to maintain stability for their daughter. Both parents, Aino and Jari, were present and cooperative during the interview. Anna was calm but reserved, showing signs of adjustment to the recent changes in her family structure.

During our conversation, it became evident that while both parents prioritize Anna's needs, they struggle with effective communication and conflict resolution. This sometimes results in tension and stress for Anna, who expressed feeling caught between them. There were no immediate safety concerns noted; however, the moderate case severity indicates a need for structured support to navigate this shared custody arrangement successfully.

**Assessment**

The family dynamics present a moderate-level challenge due to ongoing parental conflict impacting Anna's emotional stability. While both parents demonstrate love and concern for their daughter, their separation has exacerbated existing communication issues, leading to occasional tension that Anna absorbs. The shared custody arrangement, though well-intentioned, requires clearer boundaries and consistent parenting strategies to minimize stress on the child.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. **Family Counseling:** Referral to a family therapist specializing in post-separation dynamics to improve communication skills and conflict resolution between Aino and Jari, ensuring Anna's emotional needs are prioritized.

2. **Parenting Support Groups:** Encourage participation in parenting workshops focused on shared custody arrangements to equip both parents with strategies for consistent, supportive parenting practices.

3. **Regular Check-ins:** Schedule bi-monthly follow-up visits to monitor progress, address any emerging concerns, and adjust the support plan as necessary.

4. **School Liaison:** Establish contact with Anna's school to ensure they are aware of the family situation and can provide additional support if needed, fostering a collaborative approach to her wellbeing.

By implementing these recommendations, we aim to mitigate the moderate case severity, enhance family resilience, and secure Anna Koski's emotional stability during this critical period of adjustment.
