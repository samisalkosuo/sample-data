**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted to assess the integration needs and living conditions of Aino M채kel채, a young adult transitioning from foster care into independent living. The purpose was to evaluate her support requirements as she navigates the challenges of adulthood, including employment, education, and housing.

**Observations During the Visit**

Aino appeared clean and well-groomed, though there was a noticeable lack of personal belongings, suggesting recent relocation or minimal possessions. She expressed eagerness to secure stable employment and pursue further education but voiced concerns about her limited Finnish language proficiency and the absence of a supportive social network.

The living conditions were basic, with shared accommodation in a small apartment. While clean, it lacked essential furnishings, indicating financial constraints. Aino's emotional state was guarded yet hopeful, revealing resilience despite the moderate case severity. Notable concerns included her limited language skills and the absence of ongoing support from previous foster care arrangements.

**Assessment**

Aino's situation reflects a moderate case severity, characterized by the transition challenges inherent in aging out of foster care. Her limited Finnish language proficiency poses a significant barrier to employment and education opportunities. The lack of a supportive network exacerbates feelings of isolation, which could hinder her integration into Finnish society.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. **Language Support:** Arrange immediate enrollment in intensive Finnish language courses to enhance communication skills and employability.
2. **Employment and Education Guidance:** Connect Aino with a mentor from a local refugee integration program to guide her through job applications, interview preparation, and educational pathways.
3. **Housing Assistance:** Collaborate with housing authorities to explore options for subsidized or transitional housing that can accommodate her current financial situation.
4. **Social Integration:** Facilitate participation in community activities and support groups designed for young adults transitioning from care, fostering a sense of belonging and peer support.
5. **Follow-up Visit:** Schedule a follow-up within one month to reassess progress, address emerging needs, and adjust support strategies as necessary.

This report underscores the immediate need for targeted interventions to equip Aino with the language skills, employment prospects, and social connections essential for successful integration into Finnish society.
