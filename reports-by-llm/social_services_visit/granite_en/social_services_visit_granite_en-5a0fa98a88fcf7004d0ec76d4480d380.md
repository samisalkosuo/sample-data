---

**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted as part of the ongoing refugee integration support program in Taivalkoski, Finland. The purpose was to assess the living conditions, family dynamics, and overall well-being of a single mother with three children who recently arrived from a conflict zone. Given the moderate case severity, the visit aimed to identify any immediate needs, risks, and potential support gaps to ensure the family's successful integration into Finnish society.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at Aino Mäkelä's residence, I was greeted by the mother and her three children. The living conditions were moderately clean, with basic furniture and essential household items present. The children appeared healthy and engaged in their schoolwork, demonstrating a positive attitude towards learning.

Aino expressed gratitude for the support received so far but conveyed concerns about her limited Finnish language proficiency, which hinders her ability to navigate daily tasks, such as accessing healthcare services or communicating with local authorities. She also mentioned feeling isolated due to cultural differences and a lack of social connections within the community.

The emotional state of the family was generally positive, with the children displaying typical energy levels for their ages. Aino appeared attentive and caring towards her children, ensuring they completed their homework before engaging in playtime. However, there were moments of visible stress when discussing language barriers and integration challenges.

**Assessment**

The family's living conditions are adequate, with no immediate safety risks identified. The moderate case severity primarily stems from Aino's limited Finnish language skills and feelings of isolation. These factors may hinder her ability to access essential services, maintain employment, and foster social connections, potentially impacting the long-term well-being of the family.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. Language support: Arrange for Aino to enroll in a Finnish language course tailored for adults with children, ensuring she can effectively communicate and access necessary services.
2. Social integration: Connect Aino with local community organizations that offer cultural orientation programs and opportunities for social engagement, such as parent-child activities or volunteer work.
3. Employment support: Collaborate with the Finnish Public Employment Service to assess Aino's employability and provide guidance on job search strategies, interview preparation, and potential vocational training opportunities.
4. Follow-up visit: Schedule a follow-up visit in three months to reassess progress, address any emerging concerns, and adjust support measures as needed.

By addressing these recommendations, we aim to empower Aino Mäkelä and her family to overcome integration challenges and thrive within the Taivalkoski community.
