**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted to review the support plan for Aisha Khan and her family, who are refugees residing in temporary accommodation in Perho, Finland. The high case severity indicates a pressing need for ongoing support due to their recent arrival, language barriers, and potential trauma from their past experiences.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at Aisha Khan's temporary housing unit, I was greeted by Aisha, her husband Mohammad, and their two children, 8-year-old Fatima and 5-year-old Ali. The family appeared weary but polite. The living conditions were adequate for temporary housing, though cramped with shared use of a single bathroom and kitchen facilities.

Aisha expressed gratitude for the support received thus far but conveyed significant stress regarding their inability to work due to language barriers and lack of recognized qualifications. Both parents appeared anxious, with Aisha showing signs of potential post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), evident through occasional flashbacks and difficulty sleeping. Fatima and Ali seemed resilient but were visibly affected by their parents' distress.

**Assessment**

The family's situation is critically assessed due to the high case severity, which stems from multiple factors:

1. **Language Barriers:** Aisha and Mohammad have limited Finnish language skills, hindering their access to employment opportunities and integration into the local community.
2. **Economic Dependence:** Without work permits or recognized qualifications, the family is entirely reliant on social welfare support, exacerbating financial stress.
3. **Mental Health Concerns:** Aisha's potential PTSD symptoms require immediate attention to prevent further deterioration of her mental health and its impact on the children.
4. **Integration Challenges:** The family faces difficulties in navigating Finnish society, culture, and service systems due to language and cultural differences.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. **Language Support:** Arrange immediate enrollment in a comprehensive Finnish language course for both parents with flexible scheduling to accommodate potential childcare needs.
2. **Employment Assistance:** Connect the family with a local employment agency specializing in supporting refugees, focusing on skills assessment and job placement support.
3. **Mental Health Intervention:** Refer Aisha for specialized mental health counseling to address potential PTSD symptoms, ensuring culturally sensitive care.
4. **Community Integration Programs:** Enroll the family in a community integration program that offers cultural orientation, social activities, and peer support groups.
5. **Follow-up Visits:** Schedule bi-weekly visits over the next three months to monitor progress, adjust support plans as needed, and provide ongoing emotional support.

This report underscores the urgent need for targeted interventions to address the multifaceted challenges faced by Aisha Khan and her family in Perho, Finland. Immediate action is crucial to mitigate risks associated with their high case severity and facilitate a smoother transition into Finnish society.
