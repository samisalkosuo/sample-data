---

**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted to assess the financial hardship faced by Aino M채kel채, a teenage mother residing with her parents and infant child in Helsinki. The high case severity indicates an urgent need for intervention due to potential risks associated with the family's inability to meet basic needs.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at Kalevantie 12, a modest apartment in Helsinki, I was greeted by Aino and her parents. The living conditions were minimalistic, with essential furniture and limited personal belongings. The infant, Anna, appeared healthy but showed signs of developmental delay, possibly due to the lack of stimulating resources.

Aino expressed feelings of isolation and overwhelm, acknowledging her struggle to balance motherhood, education (she is enrolled in a part-time vocational course), and caring for her child. Her parents, while supportive, displayed signs of stress and fatigue from the increased caregiving responsibilities.

Notable concerns include inadequate financial resources for essential needs such as food, clothing, and diapers, as well as a lack of access to affordable childcare services. Additionally, Aino's limited education and employment prospects exacerbate the family's financial strain.

**Assessment**

The current situation poses significant risks to the well-being of Aino, her infant Anna, and her parents. The family's inability to meet basic needs may lead to malnutrition, developmental delays in the infant, and potential mental health issues for all involved. Furthermore, Aino's limited education and employment opportunities perpetuate a cycle of poverty and dependency.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. Immediate financial assistance: Connect the family with local food banks and diaper distribution programs to alleviate immediate needs.
2. Childcare support: Facilitate access to affordable childcare services, enabling Aino to pursue her education and seek employment.
3. Educational and vocational guidance: Provide Aino with resources and counseling to explore educational opportunities and potential career paths.
4. Grandparent support: Offer respite care services or family support groups for Aino's parents to address their stress and fatigue.
5. Follow-up visit: Schedule a follow-up visit within four weeks to assess progress and adjust interventions as necessary.
