**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted to provide substance abuse support to Aino Mäkelä and Jussi Kivinen, a young couple residing in Parkano, Finland. The purpose was to assess their current situation, offer guidance, and ensure the well-being of both parents and their unborn child, given the moderate severity of Aino's substance abuse issue.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at the Mäkelä-Kivinen residence, I was greeted by Aino and Jussi. The living conditions were adequate but showed signs of disarray, suggesting recent challenges in maintaining orderliness. Both parents appeared fatigued, with Aino exhibiting noticeable physical signs consistent with substance use. Emotionally, they seemed anxious about the upcoming arrival of their first child and expressed concerns regarding their ability to provide a stable environment for the baby.

During our conversation, Jussi demonstrated understanding and support for Aino's situation while also expressing his own stress and fears about their future. Aino acknowledged her substance use issue and expressed a willingness to seek help, indicating she had already begun researching local support groups.

**Assessment**

The assessment reveals a moderate case severity due to Aino's ongoing substance abuse, which poses risks to both her health and the developing fetus. The couple's young age and lack of established parenting routines further complicate their situation. While there is a clear desire for change and improvement within the household, without intervention, these risks may escalate.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. **Immediate Referral:** Aino should be referred to a local substance abuse counseling program specializing in pregnancy support. This will provide her with professional guidance and resources tailored to her needs during this critical period.

2. **Parenting Classes:** Both Aino and Jussi would benefit from attending parenting classes designed for first-time parents, focusing on newborn care, stress management, and communication skills. These classes can be scheduled at the local community center starting from next month.

3. **Regular Check-ins:** Schedule bi-weekly home visits to monitor progress, offer ongoing support, and address any emerging concerns or needs. The first follow-up visit is recommended for two weeks from today's date.

4. **Community Resources:** Connect the family with local community resources such as a food bank and clothing assistance programs to alleviate any immediate financial pressures that might exacerbate stress levels.

5. **Medical Evaluation:** Arrange for Aino to have a comprehensive medical evaluation to assess both her current health status and the baby's well-being, ensuring there are no complications arising from substance use during pregnancy.

This report outlines immediate steps to mitigate risks associated with Aino’s substance abuse and supports the couple in preparing for responsible parenthood. Consistent engagement and timely interventions will be crucial in fostering a healthier environment for the entire family.
