---

**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted as a follow-up to assess the ongoing support and care provided by Aino Mäkelä for her elderly parent, Mr. Jussi Mäkelä, who has been diagnosed with dementia. The purpose was to evaluate the effectiveness of current care strategies, identify any emerging needs, and ensure that Aino is receiving adequate support in her caregiving role.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at Ms. Mäkelä's residence, I was greeted by Mr. Mäkelä, who appeared calm and content in his familiar surroundings. The living environment was clean, well-organized, and equipped with necessary safety features such as grab bars in the bathroom and a raised toilet seat. Aino demonstrated patience and understanding while assisting her father with daily activities, including meal preparation and medication reminders.

During our conversation, Aino expressed some concerns regarding her father's increasing confusion and occasional agitation in the late afternoon hours. She also mentioned feeling overwhelmed at times due to the demanding nature of caregiving, despite having no other family members living nearby for additional support.

**Assessment**

The current situation indicates a low-severity case, as Mr. Mäkelä's physical needs are being met, and Aino is capable of managing his daily activities with some assistance. However, there are signs that the emotional strain on Aino may escalate if appropriate strategies aren't implemented to address her father's behavioral changes and alleviate her caregiver burden.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. **Behavioral Management:** Arrange a consultation with a geriatric psychologist specializing in dementia care to develop tailored strategies for managing Mr. Mäkelä's agitation and confusion during peak challenging times (late afternoon).

2. **Caregiver Support:** Connect Aino with local support groups for family caregivers of individuals with dementia, providing her an opportunity to share experiences and learn coping strategies from others in similar situations.

3. **Respite Care:** Explore options for short-term respite care services to offer Aino periodic breaks from her caregiving duties, ensuring both her well-being and the continuity of her father's care.

4. **Follow-up Visit:** Schedule a follow-up visit in four weeks to reassess progress, address any new concerns, and reinforce support measures put in place. 

By implementing these recommendations, we aim to maintain the current low severity level of this case while proactively addressing potential future challenges faced by Aino and her father.
