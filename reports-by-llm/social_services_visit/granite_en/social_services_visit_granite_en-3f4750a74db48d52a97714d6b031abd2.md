---

**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted to assess the needs and circumstances of Aapo Koskinen, an unaccompanied minor who is aging out of the foster care system. The urgent case severity indicates a pressing need for immediate intervention and support.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at Aapo's residence, I observed a modest apartment with basic amenities. Aapo, a 17-year-old male, was present and cooperative during the interview. He appeared clean and well-groomed, but there were signs of emotional distress, such as fidgeting and avoidance of eye contact.

Aapo expressed a desire for independence but also displayed uncertainty about navigating adult life without ongoing support. He mentioned having limited social connections and no known family members in Finland. The living conditions were adequate, but there was a lack of emotional support and guidance, which is crucial during this transitional phase.

**Assessment**

Aapo's situation presents several risks, including social isolation, lack of familial support, and the impending transition to independent living without proper preparation or resources. The urgent case severity underscores the need for swift intervention to mitigate these risks. Family dynamics are non-existent in this context, as Aapo has no known relatives in Finland.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. Immediate referral to a mentorship program to provide guidance and support during the transition to independent living.
2. Connection with local youth groups and community centers to foster social integration and build a support network.
3. Arrangement for regular check-ins with a social worker to monitor progress, address emerging needs, and offer ongoing support.
4. Exploration of vocational training or educational opportunities to equip Aapo with skills for future employment.
5. Schedule a follow-up visit within two weeks to reassess Aapo's situation and the effectiveness of implemented support measures.

This report serves as a starting point for comprehensive care planning, ensuring that Aapo receives the necessary assistance to navigate this critical period successfully.
