---

**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted to assess the disability support needs of Mr. Eino Koskinen, an elderly resident of Hausjärvi suffering from dementia, under the care of his daughter, Ms. Anna Koskinen. The purpose was to evaluate the current living conditions, caregiving situation, and identify potential risks or areas requiring additional support.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at Ms. Koskinen's terraced house on Kauppakatu, I observed a clean and organized environment, albeit modestly furnished. Mr. Koskinen was present and appeared calm but showed signs of confusion and disorientation, typical of moderate dementia. He required assistance with daily activities such as dressing and meal preparation.

Ms. Koskinen demonstrated patience and dedication in managing her father's needs, though she expressed feeling overwhelmed by the constant demands of caregiving. She mentioned occasional respite but highlighted the challenges in accessing reliable support services due to geographical isolation in Hausjärvi.

**Assessment**

The current living conditions are adequate for Mr. Koskinen's needs, with necessary medical equipment like a bed rail and a pressure-relieving mattress in place. However, the moderate severity of the case indicates that Ms. Koskinen could benefit from additional support to prevent caregiver burnout.

Risks identified include potential falls due to Mr. Koskinen's confusion and occasional agitation, as well as the risk of social isolation for both caregiver and care recipient. The lack of readily available respite services in Hausjärvi exacerbates these concerns.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. **Referral to Local Dementia Support Group:** To provide Ms. Koskinen with peer support, information sharing, and emotional relief.
   
2. **Home Care Services Assessment:** Arrange for a professional evaluation of home care options, including possible in-home assistance or adult day care programs tailored to Mr. Koskinen's needs.

3. **Fall Prevention Measures:** Collaborate with healthcare providers to review and possibly adjust current safety measures within the home to minimize fall risks.

4. **Follow-up Visit:** Schedule a follow-up assessment in two months to re-evaluate the situation, monitor progress, and address any emerging needs or concerns.

This report underscores the importance of timely intervention to ensure both Mr. Koskinen's wellbeing and Ms. Koskinen’s capacity to provide ongoing care without compromising her health.
