---

**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted due to an urgent referral regarding Ms. Aino Mäkelä's housing situation. As a single mother of three children, she was reported to be facing imminent homelessness, necessitating immediate verification and intervention.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at Ms. Mäkelä's residence, I observed a cluttered living space with signs of recent distress, such as packed belongings and makeshift arrangements for temporary storage. The children appeared well-dressed but exhibited signs of fatigue and anxiety.

Ms. Mäkelä was cooperative and visibly emotional, expressing her desperation to secure stable housing for her family. She disclosed that she had been evicted due to unpaid rent, having exhausted her savings and support networks. The children's school attendance records indicated recent absences, suggesting an escalating situation at home impacting their well-being.

**Assessment**

The assessment reveals a high-severity case characterized by immediate housing instability, financial strain, and potential long-term consequences for the children's education and emotional development. The family's lack of alternative support and resources exacerbates their vulnerability to homelessness.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. **Emergency Housing Placement:** Immediate referral to the local social housing authority for emergency accommodation.
2. **Financial Assistance:** Connect with Finnish Social Insurance Institution (Kela) for potential financial support and rent subsidies.
3. **Counseling Services:** Arrange for family counseling through a local NGO to address the emotional impact of this crisis on both mother and children.
4. **Educational Support:** Liaise with the children's school to ensure continuity of education and identify any additional support needs arising from disrupted attendance.
5. **Follow-up Visit:** Schedule a follow-up within one week to assess progress, re-evaluate housing stability, and adjust interventions as necessary.

This report underscores the urgency of Ms. Mäkelä's situation and the critical need for swift, comprehensive support to prevent further deterioration of her family's well-being.
