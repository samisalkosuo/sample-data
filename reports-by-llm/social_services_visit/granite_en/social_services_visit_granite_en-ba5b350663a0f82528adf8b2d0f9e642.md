---

**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This follow-up visit was conducted to assess the ongoing wellbeing and care situation of Ms. Aino Mäkelä's elderly parent, Mr. Jussi Mäkelä, who resides with her in Vehmaa, Finland. The primary objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of current care strategies, identify any emerging needs, and ensure that appropriate support services are being utilized to maintain a safe and comfortable living environment for Mr. Mäkelä, given his moderate dementia condition.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at Ms. Aino Mäkelä's residence, the home appeared clean and organized, with evidence of daily routines in place. Mr. Jussi Mäkelä was present and responsive but showed signs of confusion and restlessness, consistent with moderate dementia progression. During our conversation, he exhibited some repetitive behaviors and required frequent redirection to maintain focus.

Ms. Aino Mäkelä demonstrated a commendable level of dedication as the sole caregiver, managing daily tasks such as meal preparation, medication reminders, and light housekeeping while ensuring her father's safety. However, she expressed noticeable stress and fatigue, indicating the need for respite to prevent burnout.

**Assessment**

The current living conditions are adequate, with necessary medical equipment in place and functional. The primary risk identified is Ms. Mäkelä’s physical and emotional strain from prolonged caregiving without sufficient breaks. This situation could escalate to compromised health for the caregiver, potentially impacting the quality of care provided to Mr. Mäkelä. Family dynamics appear supportive, with occasional visits from a niece who assists during weekends.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. **Respite Care Referral:** Arrange for short-term respite care services to provide Ms. Mäkelä with regular breaks, ensuring she can recharge and maintain her health while continuing to offer quality care to her father.

2. **Support Group Connection:** Facilitate Ms. Mäkelä's enrollment in a local support group for caregivers of dementia patients to share experiences and coping strategies.

3. **Home Health Assessment:** Schedule a home health assessment by a geriatric nurse to review Mr. Mäkelä’s medication regimen, monitor his cognitive and physical decline, and adjust the care plan as necessary.

4. **Follow-up Visit:** Plan a follow-up visit in four weeks to reassess progress, address any new concerns, and reinforce support strategies.

This report underscores the importance of immediate intervention to mitigate risks associated with caregiver burnout while ensuring continued quality care for Mr. Mäkelä.
