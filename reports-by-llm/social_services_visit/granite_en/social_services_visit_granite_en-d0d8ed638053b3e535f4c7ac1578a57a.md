---

**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This follow-up visit was conducted due to a previous report concerning the truancy of Jussi Koskinen's adult daughter, Aino. The purpose was to assess the current situation, understand the reasons behind her absenteeism, and determine if any support or intervention is required.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at Mr. Koskinen's residence, I was greeted by both he and his daughter, Aino. The living conditions appeared adequate, albeit modest, with signs of regular cleaning and care. Aino seemed withdrawn during our conversation, offering brief responses to my inquiries about her school attendance. She mentioned feeling overwhelmed due to her part-time job and responsibilities at home, which she took on to help support her father.

Mr. Koskinen expressed concern for his daughter's wellbeing but acknowledged that he was unaware of the extent of her struggles. He appeared supportive and willing to assist Aino in finding solutions to her challenges.

**Assessment**

The case severity is considered low, as there are no immediate safety concerns or signs of neglect within the household. However, Aino's truancy indicates underlying issues that require attention. Her part-time job and increased responsibilities at home may be contributing factors to her absenteeism from school. It is crucial to address these pressures to ensure she can focus on her education.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. Arrange a meeting with Aino at a community center or counseling service to discuss her concerns and explore potential solutions, such as time management strategies or support groups for young adults juggling work and studies.
2. Encourage Mr. Koskinen to engage in open communication with Aino regarding her feelings and challenges, fostering a supportive environment at home.
3. Schedule a follow-up visit within four weeks to assess progress and provide additional support if necessary.
4. Collaborate with local educational authorities to explore options for flexible learning arrangements or part-time study programs that could accommodate Aino's work commitments.
