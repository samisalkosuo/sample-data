**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted to assess the disability support needs of Aisha Khan, a refugee family residing in temporary accommodation in Enonkoski, Finland. The purpose was to evaluate their living conditions, identify any potential disabilities or special needs among family members, and determine appropriate support services.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at Aisha Khan's temporary residence, I was greeted by Ms. Khan and her two children. The living space was modest but clean and organized. Ms. Khan appeared to be in good health, although she mentioned occasional back pain due to a previous injury sustained before fleeing her home country. Her children seemed active and engaged, with no immediate signs of developmental or physical disabilities.

Ms. Khan expressed gratitude for the temporary housing but voiced concerns about accessing healthcare services and integrating into Finnish society. She spoke fluent English, which facilitated communication, though she mentioned that her younger child was still learning the language.

**Assessment**

The family's living conditions are adequate for their current needs, with no apparent safety hazards or severe environmental factors contributing to disability. Ms. Khan's reported back pain does not significantly impair her daily functioning and can be managed with over-the-counter medication and gentle exercise routines.

The children appear healthy and are within typical developmental milestones for their ages. However, ongoing language support may benefit the younger child to ensure smooth integration into Finnish education systems.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. Refer Ms. Khan to local primary care services for her back pain, including possible physiotherapy sessions to manage and prevent future issues.
   
2. Connect the family with Finnish language classes tailored for refugees to support their integration into society and ensure the younger child's linguistic development.

3. Schedule a follow-up visit in three months to reassess Ms. Khanâ€™s condition, monitor her progress with pain management, and evaluate any emerging needs related to language acquisition or school enrollment for the children.

4. Maintain open communication channels with local community resources and support groups to ensure the family remains informed about available services and opportunities for social engagement.

This report reflects a low-severity case, indicating that with appropriate interventions, the family's needs can be effectively addressed within existing support frameworks.
