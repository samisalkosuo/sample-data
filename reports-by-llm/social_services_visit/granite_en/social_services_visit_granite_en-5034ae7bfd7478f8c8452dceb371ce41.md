---

**Summary of Visit Purpose:**

This visit was conducted to assess the needs and circumstances of Aapo Koskinen, a young adult residing alone in Rääkkylä, Finland. The purpose was to determine if Aapo requires support or intervention as an unaccompanied minor, given his age and living situation.

**Observations During the Visit:**

Upon arrival at Aapo's residence, I observed a clean and well-maintained apartment. Aapo, a 17-year-old male, greeted me politely and appeared comfortable in his surroundings. He expressed living alone since his parents' separation two years ago. During our conversation, Aapo demonstrated a clear understanding of his responsibilities and managed his daily tasks independently. His emotional state was calm, and he showed no signs of distress or neglect.

Aapo attends a local vocational school and participates in extracurricular activities, indicating active engagement in his community. He has a supportive network of friends and teachers who are aware of his situation. Aapo mentioned having occasional conversations with a social worker at school, which seem to address any emotional concerns.

**Assessment:**

Given the observations, Aapo Koskinen's case can be classified as low severity. He demonstrates self-sufficiency in managing his daily life and maintains positive relationships with peers and educators. Although living alone as an unaccompanied minor, there are no immediate risks to his wellbeing or safety identified during this visit.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up:**

1. Continue monitoring Aapo's situation through periodic check-ins with school social workers and teachers to ensure ongoing support.
2. Encourage Aapo to participate in any available youth groups or counseling services if he wishes to explore additional emotional support beyond his current network.
3. Schedule a follow-up visit in three months to reassess his circumstances, especially considering potential changes in schooling or living arrangements as he approaches adulthood.

This report concludes the initial assessment of Aapo Koskinen's situation. Should any concerns arise between now and the follow-up visit, please do not hesitate to contact the assigned social worker for further guidance.
