---

**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted to evaluate the parental capacity of Aino Mäkelä, the biological mother of 15-year-old teenager, Eeva, who is currently in foster care. The high case severity indicates significant concerns regarding Eeva's well-being and the potential for reunification with her mother.

**Observations During the Visit**

Aino Mäkelä appeared anxious and overwhelmed during our meeting at her residence. She expressed a strong desire to regain custody of Eeva, citing recent participation in parenting and substance abuse counseling programs. The living conditions were minimal, with signs of financial strain and clutter throughout the home.

During our conversation, Aino demonstrated some understanding of Eeva's needs but struggled to articulate specific strategies for addressing her daughter's emotional and behavioral challenges. Eeva's foster parents reported consistent positive interactions and improvements in the teenager's behavior since placement.

**Assessment**

The assessment reveals a complex situation with high-risk factors, including Aino's history of substance abuse, limited financial resources, and an unstable living environment. While Aino has shown some commitment to addressing her issues through counseling, the current circumstances suggest that she may not yet possess the necessary skills or stability to provide a safe and nurturing home for Eeva.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. Continue supporting Aino's participation in parenting and substance abuse programs, with regular progress evaluations.
2. Arrange for an independent child psychologist assessment of both Aino and Eeva to better understand their relationship dynamics and emotional needs.
3. Explore additional financial and housing support services for Aino to improve her living conditions and overall stability.
4. Schedule a follow-up visit in three months to reassess progress and determine if further intervention or alternative arrangements are necessary for Eeva's well-being.

This report will be shared with the relevant stakeholders, including foster care providers, child psychologists, and substance abuse counselors, to ensure a coordinated and comprehensive approach in addressing this high-severity case.
