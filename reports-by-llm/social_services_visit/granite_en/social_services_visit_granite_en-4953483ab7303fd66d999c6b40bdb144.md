**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted to assess the financial hardship faced by a household in Loviisa, Finland, consisting of a disabled adult (mother) and her live-in caregiver (daughter). The purpose was to evaluate their current living conditions, identify any support needs, and determine appropriate interventions to alleviate moderate financial strain.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at Anna Korhonen's residence, I was greeted by both Ms. Korhonen and her daughter, Eeva. The living conditions were modest but clean and organized. There were signs of ongoing efforts to maintain a comfortable environment despite the financial constraints.

Ms. Korhonen, who uses a wheelchair due to a chronic condition, appeared content and well-cared for by her daughter, Eeva. Their interactions were warm and supportive, indicating a strong familial bond. However, it was evident that both were under considerable stress, as reflected in their slightly tense demeanor and occasional hesitation when discussing financial matters.

During our conversation, Ms. Korhonen expressed gratitude for Eeva's dedication but also voiced concerns about the long-term sustainability of their current situation. Eeva, while committed to her mother's care, admitted feeling overwhelmed by the financial burden and fearful of potential future hardships.

**Assessment**

The assessment revealed a moderate case of financial hardship primarily driven by Ms. Korhonen's disability-related expenses, including medical equipment, therapy sessions, and occasional home modifications. Eeva's inability to work full-time due to caregiving responsibilities further exacerbated the family's financial strain.

While the living conditions were adequate, there were notable risks such as potential delays in essential medical equipment replacements and possible compromises in Ms. Korhonen's healthcare due to cost constraints. The emotional toll on both mother and daughter was also apparent, with signs of anxiety and stress affecting their overall well-being.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. **Financial Counseling:** Arrange a session with a financial advisor specializing in disability support to explore potential income sources, budget optimization, and debt management strategies.

2. **Healthcare Support:** Coordinate with local healthcare providers to ensure Ms. Korhonen receives necessary medical equipment and therapy without undue financial burden. Explore options for subsidized or free services where applicable.

3. **Respite Care:** Investigate respite care services to provide Eeva with temporary relief, allowing her to engage in part-time employment or pursue personal development opportunities, thereby reducing her caregiving load and enhancing the family's financial stability.

4. **Community Resources:** Connect the family with local community resources such as food banks, clothing assistance programs, and recreational activities to alleviate some immediate pressures and foster a sense of normalcy.

5. **Follow-up Visit:** Schedule a follow-up visit in four weeks to reassess their situation, evaluate the effectiveness of implemented support measures, and adjust interventions as necessary.

This report aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the Korhonen household's financial hardship, highlighting immediate needs and proposing actionable steps towards improving their situation. Continuous monitoring and flexible support will be crucial in addressing the evolving challenges faced by this family.
