**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This routine family wellbeing visit was conducted to assess the living conditions and emotional state of an unaccompanied minor residing in temporary housing in Salo, Finland.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at Aino Koskinen's temporary housing unit, I was greeted by 14-year-old Mikael Koskinen. The living conditions were adequate, with a clean and organized space. Mikael appeared well-groomed and showed signs of engaging in self-care activities. During our conversation, he expressed a moderate level of anxiety regarding his future plans and uncertainty about the duration of his stay in temporary housing.

Mikael reported attending school regularly and maintaining good grades, indicating a commitment to education despite the challenging circumstances. He mentioned having occasional interactions with neighbors but expressed a desire for more social engagement opportunities. Mikael's emotional state seemed stable, although there were underlying concerns about his long-term housing situation and lack of familial support.

**Assessment**

The assessment revealed a moderate case severity due to the unaccompanied minor's temporary housing status and uncertainty surrounding future arrangements. While Mikael demonstrated resilience through consistent school attendance and self-care, the absence of familial support and potential social isolation posed notable concerns. The risk of prolonged instability in housing and potential negative impacts on his emotional wellbeing necessitate immediate attention.
