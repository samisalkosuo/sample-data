**Summary of Visit Purpose:**

This emergency housing verification visit was conducted on 20.07.2025 due to a high severity case involving Eero Pietil채 and his cohabiting partner, Anna Kivinen, both experiencing mental health challenges. The purpose was to assess their immediate living conditions, evaluate the risk of homelessness, and determine the necessity for urgent intervention.

**Observations During the Visit:**

Upon arrival at Eero Pietil채's residence in Lemland, Finland, I found the couple visibly anxious but cooperative. The living conditions were minimalistic, with signs of disarray suggesting recent distress. There was a single bedroom shared by both individuals, a small kitchenette, and a bathroom. Clutter and unopened mail indicated potential neglect of routine tasks due to their mental health struggles.

Eero appeared withdrawn, expressing difficulty in managing daily activities. Anna, while supportive, also exhibited signs of stress, frequently reassuring Eero and attempting to maintain a sense of normalcy for both. Concerns were noted regarding their adherence to prescribed medication and the absence of any recent mental health professional contact.

**Assessment:**

The assessment revealed a high-risk situation due to the clients' inability to manage basic self-care tasks, coupled with the deteriorating living conditions. The lack of external support and potential non-adherence to medication heightened concerns about their mental health stability. Family dynamics showed Anna assuming a caregiving role, which, while protective, could lead to burnout without additional assistance.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up:**

1. Immediate referral to a mobile crisis team for an on-site mental health evaluation and medication management.
2. Arrangement of a home visit by a social worker specializing in mental health support to provide counseling and develop a care plan.
3. Connection with local community resources, including support groups for individuals dealing with similar challenges, to foster peer support.
4. Coordination with primary healthcare providers to ensure regular medication reviews and follow-ups.
5. Schedule a follow-up visit within one week to reassess their situation and the effectiveness of implemented interventions.

This report underscores the urgency for timely and comprehensive support to prevent potential escalation in Eero Pietil채 and Anna Kivinen's living conditions and mental health status.
