**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted to evaluate the suitability of Aino and Mikko Korhonen as potential foster parents for a child under our care, due to a reported neglect case. The assessment aims to ensure the proposed foster family environment aligns with the best interests of the child, considering the moderate severity of the neglect case.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at the Korhonen residence, the home appeared clean and organized. Aino greeted us warmly and offered refreshments, demonstrating hospitality. Mikko was present during our conversation, engaged, and attentive to their guests. Their two children, aged 10 and 14, were playing in another room, seemingly well-cared for and supervised.

During our discussion, Aino and Mikko expressed genuine interest in fostering and shared their experiences with parenting their own children. They highlighted their commitment to providing a nurturing environment and emphasized their desire to support the child's emotional and developmental needs. Both parents demonstrated patience and understanding, addressing potential challenges with thoughtfulness.

**Assessment**

The Korhonen household presents a stable and supportive environment for fostering. The parents displayed strong communication skills, empathy, and a willingness to learn about the specific needs of a child experiencing neglect. They acknowledged the importance of consistency, routine, and open dialogue in addressing potential emotional and behavioral issues that may arise from past neglect.

While their home environment appears suitable, it is crucial to consider the moderate severity of the case. The foster parents must be prepared for possible emotional outbursts or regressive behaviors from the child, as well as potential sensitivities around food, hygiene, and personal care. Aino and Mikko's openness to ongoing support and training indicates their readiness to meet these challenges.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. **Pre-fostering training:** Aino and Mikko should participate in a comprehensive foster parent training program focusing on understanding neglect, its impacts, and strategies for supporting children who have experienced it. This training will equip them with the necessary skills to address potential challenges effectively.

2. **Individualized support plan:** Develop a tailored support plan for the Korhonen household, outlining specific strategies for managing behaviors related to neglect. This plan should include regular check-ins and consultations with a social worker to ensure ongoing support and guidance.

3. **Family therapy referral:** Given the reported neglect case, it would be beneficial for Aino, Mikko, and their biological children to engage in family therapy sessions. This will help them navigate any potential emotional impacts of fostering on their own family dynamics and strengthen their collective resilience.

4. **Follow-up visits:** Schedule regular follow-up visits within the first three months post-placement to monitor progress, address emerging concerns, and provide ongoing support to the foster parents. Subsequent visits should occur every six months thereafter or as needed.

By implementing these recommendations, we aim to ensure that Aino and Mikko Korhonen can successfully provide a nurturing and stable environment for the child in their care, ultimately contributing to the child's well-being and development.
