**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted to evaluate the parental capacity in addressing their teenager's school attendance issues, as reported by the local educational authorities. The case severity is low, indicating that the family's challenges are manageable with appropriate support.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at Aino Mäkelä's residence, I was greeted by Ms. Mäkelä and her teenage daughter, Eeva. The living conditions were clean and well-maintained, with a cozy atmosphere. Eeva appeared to be in good health, though she seemed withdrawn during our conversation.

During our discussion, Ms. Mäkelä expressed concern over Eeva's recent school absences, attributing them to social anxiety and difficulty engaging with peers. She demonstrated a willingness to seek help and collaborate with educational institutions to address the issue. Eeva, though initially reluctant to speak, eventually shared her feelings of isolation and fear of judgment from classmates.

**Assessment**

The family dynamics appear supportive, with Ms. Mäkelä displaying empathy and understanding towards Eeva's struggles. The case severity is considered low due to the family's proactive approach and the absence of any immediate safety concerns or neglect. However, Eeva's social anxiety may escalate if not addressed promptly, potentially impacting her academic performance and overall well-being.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. Refer Ms. Mäkelä and Eeva to a local mental health professional specializing in adolescent anxiety for counseling sessions.
2. Encourage participation in school-based support groups or social skills training programs to help Eeva build confidence and foster positive peer relationships.
3. Schedule a follow-up visit in four weeks to assess progress and adjust the support plan as needed.
4. Maintain open communication with Eeva's school to ensure a coordinated approach in addressing her attendance issues.
