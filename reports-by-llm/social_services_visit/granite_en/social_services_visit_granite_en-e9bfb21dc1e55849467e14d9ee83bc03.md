---

**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted to assess the parental capacity of Aino Mäkelä and her adult sibling, who are co-habiting in Pyhtää, Finland. The evaluation aims to understand their ability to provide a safe, nurturing environment for any dependent children, considering the moderate severity of the case.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at Aino Mäkelä's residence, the living conditions appeared moderately clean and organized. The shared space between Aino and her sibling, Marko, was functional but lacked personal touches. During our interaction, both individuals were cooperative and engaged in conversation.

Aino demonstrated a clear understanding of child development needs and expressed a strong desire to provide for any potential dependents. However, concerns arose regarding her sibling's involvement; Marko appeared detached and showed limited interest in the discussion about parenting responsibilities.

Emotionally, Aino seemed composed and resilient, while Marko exhibited signs of stress, possibly linked to the moderate case severity and potential future responsibilities. There were no immediate safety hazards identified within the home.

**Assessment**

The assessment indicates that Aino Mäkelä possesses the necessary cognitive abilities and emotional stability to fulfill parental duties. Her proactive approach and clear understanding of childcare requirements are commendable. However, the moderate case severity, coupled with her sibling's limited engagement and apparent stress, introduces potential risks.

The family dynamics suggest a reliance on Aino's primary parenting role, with Marko's passive involvement posing a risk to consistent, high-quality care for any children. The lack of clear division of responsibilities within the household is a notable concern.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. **Parenting Support Workshops:** Aino should be enrolled in parenting classes to enhance her skills and confidence. Marko's participation is encouraged to foster a collaborative approach to child-rearing.
   
2. **Family Counseling:** Scheduled sessions with a family therapist are recommended to address the dynamics between Aino and Marko, ensuring a more balanced and supportive environment for any children.

3. **Regular Check-ins:** Bi-monthly visits will be scheduled to monitor progress, provide ongoing support, and reassess parental capacity as circumstances evolve.

4. **Resource Referral:** Connection with local community resources, such as childcare support groups and financial assistance programs, should be established to alleviate potential stressors.

This report underscores the need for targeted interventions to mitigate risks associated with the moderate case severity while supporting Aino's parental aspirations and fostering a more cohesive family unit in Pyhtää, Finland.
