**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted as part of an unaccompanied minor intake assessment due to reported school attendance issues concerning a teenager residing in the household of Aino Mäkelä in Vaasa, Finland. The purpose was to evaluate the situation, identify risks, and understand family dynamics to determine appropriate support services.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at Ms. Mäkelä's residence, the teenager, 14-year-old Eeva Mäkelä, was present alongside her mother. The living conditions were adequate, with a clean and organized environment. Eeva appeared well-groomed but displayed signs of restlessness and occasional avoidance during conversation. Her emotional state seemed guarded, indicating potential underlying stress or anxiety.

During the interview, Ms. Mäkelä expressed concern over her daughter's recent decline in school performance and attendance. Eeva admitted to feeling overwhelmed by academic pressures and peer relationships, though she hesitated to openly discuss these issues. There were no immediate signs of neglect or abuse; however, the strained communication between mother and daughter suggested a need for improved familial support systems.

**Assessment**

The situation presents moderate severity, primarily due to Eeva's school attendance issues and her evident emotional distress. While there are no immediate safety concerns, the lack of open communication within the household poses risks for Eeva’s academic and psychological well-being. The family dynamics indicate a need for intervention to enhance support structures and foster healthier communication patterns.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. **Counseling Services:** Arrange for Eeva to begin individual counseling sessions with a school-based psychologist to address her emotional distress and improve coping mechanisms.
   
2. **Family Therapy:** Initiate family therapy sessions to strengthen communication, build trust, and equip Ms. Mäkelä with strategies to better support Eeva’s needs.

3. **Academic Support:** Collaborate with Eeva's school to provide additional academic assistance, such as tutoring or study skills workshops, to alleviate her feelings of being overwhelmed.

4. **Follow-up Visit:** Schedule a follow-up visit in four weeks to reassess progress and adjust interventions as necessary.

This report will be shared with the relevant support services involved to ensure coordinated care for Eeva Mäkelä, aiming to mitigate current challenges and prevent potential escalation of issues.
