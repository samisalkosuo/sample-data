**Summary of Visit Purpose:**
This visit was conducted to assess the compliance of the Mäkelä family with juvenile probation conditions following a history of domestic violence incidents. The purpose was to evaluate the living conditions, family dynamics, and adherence to court-mandated interventions.

**Observations During the Visit:**
Upon arrival at Aino Mäkelä's residence in Perho, Finland, the environment appeared clean and organized. The juvenile, 16-year-old Eero Mäkelä, was present along with his mother, Aino. Both appeared calm and cooperative during the interaction. There were no signs of immediate distress or ongoing violence.

Aino expressed understanding of the probation terms and confirmed that Eero had been attending mandatory counseling sessions as ordered by the court. She also reported regular check-ins with a social worker, which she described as supportive. The family's living conditions met basic standards, with adequate food supplies and no indications of substance abuse or neglect.

Eero seemed engaged in his schooling, though he mentioned occasional tension with peers due to the family’s past. His emotional state appeared stable, with no signs of anxiety or depression noted. Aino demonstrated a willingness to address any emerging issues and sought continued support from social services.

**Assessment:**
Given the low case severity, the current situation within the Mäkelä household appears stable. The family's adherence to probation conditions is evident, with Eero actively participating in counseling and Aino maintaining open communication channels with social workers. There are no immediate risks identified, and the absence of recent violent incidents suggests progress in managing past behaviors.

However, ongoing vigilance is recommended to ensure that any emerging challenges are promptly addressed. The family's history necessitates continued support to prevent potential relapse into harmful patterns.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up:**
1. Continue bi-weekly check-ins with Aino and Eero to monitor compliance and provide ongoing emotional support.
2. Encourage Eero’s participation in peer support groups to address any lingering social issues stemming from the family's history.
3. Schedule a review meeting in three months to reassess progress, focusing on maintaining open communication and addressing any new concerns that may arise.
4. Maintain referral to the family’s current counselor for consistent therapeutic support.

This report reflects a positive step forward for the Mäkelä family, with Aino demonstrating proactive engagement in ensuring her son's well-being and compliance with legal obligations. Continued support and vigilance are crucial to sustain this progress and prevent future escalation of risks.
