**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted as a routine newborn and infant safety check, given the recent history of domestic abuse reported by Ms. Mäkelä. The purpose was to assess the living conditions, evaluate the emotional well-being of both mother and child, and ensure the safety and security of the newborn in the household.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at Aino Mäkelä's residence on Kauppakatu, I found a clean and organized living space. Ms. Mäkelä appeared calm and composed, showing no signs of distress or fear. She was attentive to her newborn, demonstrating appropriate care and interaction with the infant. The baby seemed healthy and content in a safe sleeping environment.

During our conversation, Ms. Mäkelä expressed gratitude for the support received from local women's shelters following her separation from the abusive partner. She reported feeling safer and more secure since moving into independent housing arranged by social services. There were no immediate concerns regarding her mental health or ability to care for her child.

**Assessment**

The current situation presents a low-severity case, primarily due to Ms. Mäkelä's proactive steps in ensuring her safety and that of her infant. The household environment is stable, with no apparent risks identified during this visit. However, ongoing support is necessary to address potential long-term psychological effects from past abuse and to reinforce healthy parenting practices.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. Continue regular check-ins every two weeks for the next three months to monitor Ms. Mäkelä's adjustment to independent living and her infant's development.
   
2. Refer Ms. Mäkelä to a local counseling service specializing in trauma recovery from domestic abuse to address any lingering emotional impacts of her past experiences.

3. Encourage participation in parenting support groups offered by community centers to foster social connections and reinforce positive parenting techniques.

4. Schedule a follow-up comprehensive assessment after six months to evaluate progress, adjust support strategies if needed, and plan for eventual reduction in service intensity as Ms. Mäkelä gains further confidence and stability. 

This report concludes with the understanding that while current risks are low, consistent, tailored support will be crucial in empowering Aino Mäkelä to navigate her new life independently and safely with her infant.
