---

**Summary of Visit Purpose:**
This emergency visit was conducted to verify the current living conditions of Ms. Aino Korhonen, an elderly woman residing in Askola, Finland, who has been exhibiting early signs of dementia. The purpose was to assess her immediate housing needs and ensure her safety and well-being amidst potential cognitive decline.

**Observations During the Visit:**
Upon arrival at Ms. Korhonen's residence, I observed a modest apartment with signs of neglect, including unattended mail piling up on the entrance table and dishes left in the sink for an extended period. Ms. Korhonen appeared disoriented, frequently repeating questions about her surroundings and expressing confusion regarding the day's date. Her emotional state was fluctuating between agitation and passive acceptance, indicative of early-stage dementia symptoms.

During our interaction, it became evident that Ms. Korhonen's only child, who resides abroad, relies on infrequent phone calls to monitor her well-being. There was no visible support network within the local community, heightening concerns about potential isolation and lack of immediate assistance in case of emergencies.

**Assessment:**
The assessment reveals a high-severity case due to Ms. Korhonen's cognitive impairment and the deteriorating living conditions. The absence of regular in-person support from family and the visible signs of neglect in her home pose significant risks, including potential health hazards from unsanitary conditions and the danger of falls due to clutter.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up:**
1. **Immediate Housing Inspection:** Arrange for a thorough inspection by local housing authorities to evaluate the habitability of Ms. Korhonen's residence, focusing on safety standards suitable for someone with dementia.
   
2. **Healthcare Referral:** Urgently refer Ms. Korhonen to a geriatrician specializing in dementia care for a comprehensive evaluation and development of a personalized care plan. This should include cognitive assessments, medication management, and strategies to manage behavioral symptoms.

3. **Social Support Coordination:** Connect Ms. Korhonen with local support groups or community programs designed for individuals with dementia and their families. Explore options for respite care to alleviate the burden on her distant child and ensure regular check-ins by trained volunteers or social workers.

4. **Follow-up Visit:** Schedule a follow-up visit within one week to reassess living conditions, confirm implementation of recommended services, and provide ongoing support coordination. Subsequent visits should be planned bi-monthly initially, reducing frequency as stability improves.

This report underscores the urgency for intervention to safeguard Ms. Korhonen's health and well-being in light of her deteriorating cognitive state and isolated living situation. Immediate action is critical to mitigate identified risks and ensure appropriate support systems are in place.
