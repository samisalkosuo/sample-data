---

**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted as part of the ongoing refugee integration support program in Riihimäki, Finland. The purpose was to assess the well-being and integration progress of the Khan family, who recently relocated from a conflict zone. Given the moderate case severity, the focus was on identifying any immediate needs, evaluating their living conditions, and understanding their adaptation process within the new community.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at the Khan residence, I was greeted by Aisha Khan, who appeared friendly and cooperative. The family lives in a modest two-bedroom apartment provided through a local housing assistance program. The living conditions were clean and tidy, though sparsely furnished. The children were present and engaged in their homework, demonstrating a positive attitude towards education.

Aisha expressed gratitude for the support received so far but conveyed concerns about her husband Mohammad's struggle to find employment suitable to his qualifications. She also mentioned feeling isolated due to language barriers and cultural differences, which hindered their social integration. Emotionally, Aisha seemed resilient, displaying determination to adapt and contribute to the community.

**Assessment**

The Khan family's living conditions are adequate, with no immediate safety risks identified. However, Mohammad's unemployment poses a moderate concern, as it affects their financial stability and sense of purpose. Aisha's feelings of isolation, though not severe, could escalate if left unaddressed, potentially impacting her mental well-being and the family dynamics negatively.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. **Employment Support:** Arrange a meeting with the local employment agency to assist Mohammad in identifying job opportunities aligned with his skills and qualifications. This should include language training if necessary to enhance his employability.

2. **Language and Cultural Integration:** Enroll Aisha in a Finnish language course tailored for adults, alongside cultural orientation sessions to foster her integration into the community.

3. **Social Support Network:** Connect the family with local community groups or support networks for immigrants to alleviate feelings of isolation and facilitate social engagement.

4. **Follow-up Visit:** Schedule a follow-up visit in four weeks to reassess progress, address any emerging concerns, and provide ongoing support as needed.

This report aims to ensure the Khan family receives the necessary assistance to navigate their integration process successfully, addressing both immediate needs and long-term stability.
