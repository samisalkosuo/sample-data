---

**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted to assess the substance abuse situation within a multi-generational household experiencing significant financial hardship. The high case severity indicates an urgent need for intervention and support.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival, I was greeted by Aino Mäkelä, the matriarch of the household. She appeared disheveled and visibly anxious. Her daughter, Eeva, and granddaughter, Anna, were also present. Eeva, in her late twenties, displayed signs of fatigue and emotional distress. Anna, aged seven, was well-dressed but quiet, engrossed in a book.

The living conditions were modest, with signs of disarray suggesting recent financial strain. The kitchen lacked basic food staples, and the overall cleanliness was subpar. Aino admitted to struggling with alcohol abuse, which she claimed exacerbated their financial woes due to reduced work capacity and increased spending on alcohol.

**Assessment**

The household's high case severity is primarily driven by Aino's severe substance abuse issue, compounded by their financial difficulties. The lack of essential food items indicates potential neglect of basic needs, posing immediate risks to the family's well-being. Eeva's emotional distress and Anna's quiet demeanor suggest indirect impacts of Aino's substance abuse and the resulting family stress.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. Immediate referral to a local substance abuse treatment program for Aino, emphasizing the urgency due to her high case severity.
2. Arrangement for Eeva's enrollment in a support group for adults affected by parental substance abuse.
3. Coordination with a food bank or social welfare service to address immediate nutritional needs within the household.
4. Scheduling a follow-up visit within one week to assess progress and provide ongoing support.
5. Exploration of additional resources, such as financial counseling and employment assistance for Aino, to address underlying causes of their financial difficulties.
