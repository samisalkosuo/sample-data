**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This safety plan monitoring visit was conducted to assess the ongoing effectiveness of the established safety plan for Aino Mäkelä and her sibling, who share a residence in Toivakka. The high case severity indicates a heightened risk for the siblings due to their shared living situation and potential vulnerabilities.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at the designated address, I was greeted by Aino Mäkelä, who appeared anxious but cooperative. Her sibling, Olli Mäkelä, was present but remained largely non-communicative. The living conditions were substandard, with signs of neglect and clutter throughout the shared space. There was a noticeable lack of basic necessities such as adequate food supplies and cleanliness, raising concerns about their overall well-being.

Aino expressed worry about Olli's mental health, mentioning his increasing isolation and occasional aggressive outbursts. She also disclosed that they had been experiencing threats from an unknown individual, which contributed to their heightened state of fear and the need for ongoing safety measures.

**Assessment**

The assessment reveals a complex family dynamic characterized by high stress levels, potential mental health issues within the household, and external threats. The substandard living conditions exacerbate these risks, placing both siblings at significant harm. Aino's role as primary caregiver amidst her own vulnerabilities further complicates their situation, necessitating immediate intervention.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. **Immediate Support:** Arrange for an urgent mental health assessment for Olli Mäkelä to address his behavioral concerns and provide Aino with respite care to alleviate her caregiving burden.
   
2. **Safety Measures:** Collaborate with local law enforcement to investigate the reported threats, ensuring a comprehensive safety plan that includes protective measures against potential harm from external sources.

3. **Resource Allocation:** Connect the household with community resources such as food banks and cleaning services to improve their living conditions immediately.

4. **Ongoing Monitoring:** Schedule bi-weekly follow-up visits to monitor progress, reassess risks, and adjust interventions as necessary. Engage a social worker specializing in family dynamics to provide targeted support and mediation if required.

5. **Case Review:** Convene a multidisciplinary case review meeting within two weeks involving mental health professionals, law enforcement, and housing authorities to develop a coordinated, long-term strategy addressing the identified risks and vulnerabilities comprehensively.

This report underscores the urgency of the situation and the necessity for swift, collaborative action among relevant service providers to ensure the safety and well-being of Aino and Olli Mäkelä.
