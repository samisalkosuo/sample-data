---

**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted to assess the needs and circumstances of an unaccompanied minor residing with a family in Hailuoto, Finland. The high case severity indicates potential significant risks or complex requirements for support services.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at the Miettinen household, I was greeted by Aino Miettinen, the mother of the 14-year-old unaccompanied minor, Liisa. The apartment, though subsidized, showed signs of disarray and lacked essential amenities, suggesting financial strain. Liisa appeared withdrawn and anxious during our interaction, avoiding eye contact and speaking in hushed tones. Her siblings, aged 10 and 7, were boisterous and seemed to bear the brunt of their older sister's emotional distress.

The father, Mikko Miettinen, was absent, reportedly working long hours at multiple jobs to sustain the family. Aino expressed concern over Liisa's recent behavioral changes but lacked insight into potential triggers or support resources. The children's educational needs appeared neglected, with school attendance irregular and homework incomplete.

**Assessment**

The assessment reveals a high-risk situation due to financial instability, inadequate living conditions, and the unmet emotional and educational needs of Liisa. The family's reliance on multiple income sources indicates potential vulnerability to exploitation or further deterioration should circumstances worsen. Liisa's withdrawn behavior suggests she may be experiencing trauma or stress, possibly related to her unaccompanied minor status or family dynamics.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. Immediate referral to a mental health professional for Liisa to address potential trauma or emotional distress.
2. Connection with local support groups for unaccompanied minors and their families.
3. Collaboration with educational authorities to ensure regular school attendance and provide necessary academic support.
4. Assessment of the family's financial situation and potential eligibility for additional welfare benefits or employment support services.
5. Scheduled follow-up visit in two weeks to monitor progress and adjust interventions as needed.

This report underscores the urgency of addressing Liisa's emotional well-being and the family's broader needs to prevent further deterioration of their circumstances.
