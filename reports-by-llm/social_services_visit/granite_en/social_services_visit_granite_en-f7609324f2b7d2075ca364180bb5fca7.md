---

**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted as part of an ongoing immigration case monitoring process. The primary purpose was to assess the living conditions, well-being, and support needs of the grandchildren under the care of Aino and Jussi Korhonen, who have recently immigrated to Finland. Given the high severity of this case, the visit aimed to identify immediate risks, evaluate family dynamics, and determine appropriate interventions.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at the Korhonen residence, it was evident that the home environment was modest but clean and organized. Aino and Jussi, both in their late 60s, appeared to be actively engaged in caring for their three grandchildren aged 8, 12, and 15. The children seemed healthy and well-fed, though there were signs of limited access to recreational activities or resources outside the home.

During interactions, Aino and Jussi expressed gratitude for the support received but also conveyed feelings of isolation and stress due to language barriers and unfamiliarity with local services. The eldest grandchild, a teenager, appeared withdrawn and showed signs of potential emotional distress, possibly linked to acculturation challenges.

**Assessment**

The assessment reveals a high-risk situation primarily due to the grandparents' limited Finnish language proficiency, which hinders their access to essential services and community support. The children's educational needs are not being fully met, as evidenced by the teenager's withdrawn behavior and lack of engagement in school activities. There is also a risk of social isolation for both the grandparents and grandchildren, exacerbated by cultural differences and limited local integration.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. **Language Support:** Arrange immediate language classes for Aino and Jussi to enhance their Finnish language skills, facilitating better communication with service providers and community engagement.
   
2. **Cultural Orientation:** Provide cultural orientation sessions to help the family navigate Finnish societal norms and expectations, reducing potential culture shock and isolation.

3. **Educational Assessment:** Conduct a comprehensive educational assessment for all grandchildren, with a focus on the teenager's emotional well-being and academic support needs.

4. **Community Integration:** Connect the family with local community resources and support groups to foster social connections and reduce feelings of isolation.

5. **Follow-up Visit:** Schedule a follow-up visit within four weeks to reassess progress, address any emerging concerns, and adjust intervention strategies as necessary.

This report underscores the urgency for timely and comprehensive support to ensure the well-being and successful integration of this immigrant family into Finnish society.
