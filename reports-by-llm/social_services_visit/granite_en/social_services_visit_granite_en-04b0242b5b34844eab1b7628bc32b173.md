---

**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This homeless outreach visit was conducted due to a critical case severity level, indicating an urgent need for support. The teenage mother, Aino Koskinen, along with her newborn and her parents, Jouko and Maija Koskinen, were reportedly residing in temporary accommodation following a recent eviction. The family's situation was deemed critical due to the lack of stable housing, limited financial resources, and the vulnerability of the infant.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at the Koskinen household, I found the family residing in a small, cramped room within a local community center's temporary shelter facility. The living conditions were basic but clean, with essential amenities provided by the center. Aino appeared exhausted and overwhelmed, displaying signs of stress and anxiety. She expressed gratitude for the temporary support but emphasized her desire to secure stable housing and employment to ensure a safe environment for her infant.

Jouko and Maija Koskinen were supportive and engaged in caring for their grandchild, demonstrating a willingness to assist Aino in navigating this challenging period. However, it was evident that the family's limited financial resources and lack of stable housing posed significant risks to their well-being.

**Assessment**

The assessment reveals a critical case with multiple risk factors, including inadequate housing, financial instability, and the vulnerability of an infant. The teenage mother's limited life experience and lack of support networks exacerbate these risks. Immediate intervention is required to address the family's basic needs and prevent potential harm to the infant.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. **Housing Support:** Collaborate with local housing authorities and non-profit organizations to identify suitable, affordable, and safe permanent housing for the family. Prioritize properties with essential amenities and proximity to support services.
2. **Financial Assistance:** Connect the family with financial counseling and potential income-generating opportunities, such as vocational training or part-time employment, to improve their long-term economic stability.
3. **Infant Care and Development Support:** Arrange for regular pediatric check-ups and provide access to early childhood education resources to ensure the infant's healthy development.
4. **Mental Health Support:** Offer Aino access to counseling services to address her stress, anxiety, and potential postpartum depression, fostering her emotional well-being and parenting capabilities.
5. **Family Cohesion:** Facilitate family therapy sessions to strengthen communication, build resilience, and promote a supportive environment for Aino and her infant.
6. **Follow-up Visits:** Schedule bi-weekly visits to monitor progress, address emerging concerns, and adjust the support plan as needed.

This report serves as a starting point for addressing the Koskinen family's critical needs. Immediate and coordinated action from various support services is essential to ensure their safety, well-being, and successful transition towards stability.
