**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This emergency housing verification visit was conducted in response to a reported neglect case within a two-parent household in Hammarland, Finland. The high severity of the case necessitated an immediate assessment of living conditions and family dynamics to ensure the safety and well-being of all involved, particularly any minor children.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at the Korhonen residence, a modest two-story apartment in central Hammarland, I was greeted by Aino Korhonen, the reported primary caregiver. She appeared disheveled and visibly anxious, providing inconsistent responses to my inquiries regarding her children's whereabouts. Her husband, Jussi, was present but remained largely silent and withdrawn.

The living conditions were substandard, with clutter and debris scattered throughout the common areas. There was a noticeable lack of essential household items such as clean linens and adequate food supplies. The children's bedrooms, when briefly glimpsed, showed signs of neglectâ€”unmade beds, dirty clothing piled on the floor, and no visible toys or educational materials.

Aino expressed confusion and denial about the reported neglect allegations, attributing the disarray to recent moving stressors. However, her emotional state suggested underlying issues that may impede her ability to provide a stable environment for her children.

**Assessment**

The immediate environment poses significant risks to the health and development of any minor children residing within the household. The parents' inability to maintain basic living standards, coupled with Aino's evasive responses and Jussi's lack of engagement, indicates a critical breakdown in family functioning.

The high severity of this case necessitates urgent intervention to prevent further deterioration of the children's well-being. There are concerns about potential emotional neglect, which could manifest as behavioral or developmental issues in the children if left unaddressed.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. **Immediate Referral:** The family should be referred to a comprehensive assessment by child protective services to evaluate the children's current needs and safety.
   
2. **Parental Support:** Aino and Jussi require access to parenting classes and counseling services to address their inability to maintain a stable home environment and manage stress effectively.

3. **Housing Assistance:** Given the reported moving stressors, explore emergency housing options or transitional support to alleviate immediate living conditions' impact on family dynamics.

4. **Follow-up Visit:** Schedule a follow-up visit within one week to monitor progress and ensure compliance with recommended services. Adjust the timeline as necessary based on the family's engagement and observed improvements.

This report underscores the urgency of intervention in the Korhonen household to mitigate risks and support the family toward stabilization and improved child welfare.
