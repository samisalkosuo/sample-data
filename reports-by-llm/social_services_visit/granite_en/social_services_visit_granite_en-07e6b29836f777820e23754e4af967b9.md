**Summary of Visit Purpose:**
This visit was conducted to assess the living conditions and family dynamics of two adult siblings, Aino (45) and Anna Mäkelä (42), who share housing in Närpiö, Finland. The purpose was to ensure the well-being of their minor child during supervised visitations, as part of an ongoing low-severity case.

The residence appeared clean and organized, with adequate furnishings for the siblings and their young daughter, Eeva (8). The sisters displayed a cooperative relationship, engaging in positive interactions with each other and their child. Eeva seemed content and well-cared for, participating in age-appropriate activities during the visit.

The family dynamics were stable, with minimal signs of conflict or tension. Both Aino and Anna demonstrated responsible parenting skills, ensuring Eeva's safety and supervising her interactions during the visit. The living conditions met basic needs, and no immediate risks or concerns were identified. The low case severity suggests that the family is functioning adequately under current circumstances.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up:**
Given the stable family dynamics and satisfactory living conditions, it is recommended to continue monitoring the situation through periodic check-ins every three months. This will help maintain open communication and address any potential concerns that may arise in the future. Additionally, it is advised to provide resources for sibling support groups or counseling services if either Aino or Anna express interest in further assistance. The next scheduled visit is recommended for 15.09.2025.
