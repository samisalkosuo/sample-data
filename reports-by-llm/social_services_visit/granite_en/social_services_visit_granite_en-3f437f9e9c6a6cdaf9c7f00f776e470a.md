**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted as a follow-up to the parenting education program that Aino M채kel채, a single mother of three children, had previously engaged with.

Aino was cooperative and open to discussing her experiences since completing the parenting education program.

During our conversation, Aino expressed confidence in managing daily routines and reported improvements in her children's behavior, particularly noting fewer outbursts and better school attendance.

Aino acknowledged the need for additional support to address these more complex issues.

**Assessment**

The living conditions are adequate, and there is evidence of Aino's commitment to providing a stable home environment. The moderate case severity suggests that while progress has been made, there remain areas requiring further attention. The emotional well-being of the teenage daughter appears to be the most pressing concern, potentially indicating underlying issues that need professional intervention.

2. **Parenting Support Group:** Encourage Aino's participation in a parenting support group, which can offer ongoing peer support and additional strategies for managing challenging behaviors.

3. **Follow-up Visit:** Schedule a follow-up visit in two months to reassess progress, provide further guidance, and ensure that the recommended interventions are being effectively implemented.

This report underscores the importance of continued support for Aino and her family, particularly in navigating the complexities introduced by adolescence within their household dynamics.
