---

**Summary of Visit Purpose:**

This visit was conducted due to an emergency housing verification request. The case context indicates a potential risk to the well-being and safety of the elderly man, Jussi Koskinen, who resides with his adult daughter, Anna Koskinen, in Savukoski, Finland.

**Observations During the Visit:**

Upon arrival at the designated address, I was greeted by Ms. Anna Koskinen, who appeared anxious and cooperative. The living conditions were moderately adequate, with basic necessities provided. However, there were signs of disarray and clutter, suggesting potential difficulties in maintaining cleanliness and order.

Mr. Jussi Koskinen was present and appeared to be in good health for his age, although he seemed withdrawn and required assistance with mobility. He expressed gratitude for the visit but showed signs of mild confusion during conversation, which may indicate early-stage cognitive decline.

**Assessment:**

The current living situation poses a moderate risk to Mr. Koskinen's well-being due to his age and potential cognitive impairment. While Ms. Koskinen demonstrates care for her father, the cluttered environment could potentially harbor hidden hazards, such as tripping risks or difficulty in accessing emergency services if needed.

Family dynamics appear supportive, with Ms. Koskinen providing primary care for her father. However, there is a need to address the chaotic living conditions to ensure safety and improve quality of life.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up:**

1. Arrange for a home safety assessment to identify and mitigate potential hazards within the residence.
2. Provide Ms. Koskinen with resources and guidance on organizing their living space, possibly through a community support program focused on senior care and decluttering assistance.
3. Schedule a follow-up visit in two weeks to reassess living conditions and ensure recommended actions have been implemented.
4. Consider referral to local geriatric services for Mr. Koskinen's cognitive health evaluation, given his signs of confusion.
5. Maintain open communication with Ms. Koskinen to offer ongoing support and address any emerging concerns promptly.
