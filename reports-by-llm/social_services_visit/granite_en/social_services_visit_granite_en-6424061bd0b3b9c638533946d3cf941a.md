**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted to assess Aino Mäkelä's progress in her social reintegration following her completion of a rehabilitation program. The purpose was to evaluate her living conditions, emotional state, and overall well-being within the transitional housing environment.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at Aino Mäkelä's residence, I found her in good spirits, engaged in organizing her living space. The transitional housing unit was clean and tidy, demonstrating Aino's commitment to maintaining a healthy environment. She expressed gratitude for the opportunity to live independently and spoke positively about her participation in group therapy sessions.

During our conversation, Aino discussed her employment prospects, mentioning ongoing job applications and interviews. Her interactions with neighbors were friendly, indicating a growing sense of community integration. However, she did express concerns regarding occasional feelings of isolation and the challenges of adapting to self-reliance after years of institutional living.

**Assessment**

Aino Mäkelä's moderate case severity reflects her progress in rehabilitation and her active engagement in transitional housing. Her living conditions are satisfactory, and she demonstrates a clear motivation for personal growth. The emotional state is generally positive, with occasional signs of vulnerability that suggest the need for continued support.

Family dynamics are limited to minimal contact with an estranged adult child, which does not currently pose a significant risk but warrants monitoring for potential future developments. The primary risk identified is Aino's vulnerability to feelings of isolation, which could hinder her reintegration process if left unaddressed.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. Encourage participation in community-building activities to alleviate feelings of isolation.
2. Facilitate connection with local support groups focused on post-rehabilitation individuals for peer support.
3. Schedule a follow-up visit in four weeks to reassess progress and address any emerging concerns.
4. Coordinate with employment services to provide job readiness training and ongoing job placement assistance.
5. Maintain open communication channels for Aino to access counseling if needed, ensuring she feels supported throughout her reintegration journey.
