**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted to assess the risk of domestic violence within the household, as per the reported concern regarding an unaccompanied minor residing in temporary housing. The purpose was to evaluate the living conditions, family dynamics, and potential risks to ensure the safety and well-being of the minor.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at Aino Mäkelä's temporary housing unit, I observed a clean and organized living space suitable for a single individual. The minor, 14-year-old Anna Mäkelä, was present and cooperative during the interview. She appeared well-groomed and showed no signs of distress or injury.

Anna reported that her mother, Aino, had separated from her abusive partner two months prior. Since then, they have been living in temporary housing provided by local social services. Anna expressed relief at the separation and mentioned improved mood and school performance since moving away from the previous residence.

Aino Mäkelä was present during the interview with her daughter. She appeared calm, cooperative, and displayed no signs of aggression or instability. Aino confirmed Anna's account of events leading to their separation and expressed gratitude for the support received from social services.

**Assessment**

Based on the observations and information gathered, the current risk of domestic violence appears low. The separation between Aino and her former partner has been peaceful, with no reported incidents of violence or threats since their parting. Anna's emotional state and school performance have noticeably improved, indicating a safer environment for her.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. Continue monitoring the situation through periodic check-ins to ensure stability and address any emerging concerns.
2. Facilitate access to counseling services for both Aino and Anna to process past trauma and promote emotional well-being.
3. Assist in securing permanent housing as soon as possible, considering the positive impact of stable living conditions on their recovery.
4. Provide information regarding local support groups and resources for victims of domestic violence, should the need arise.

The next follow-up visit is scheduled for 23.11.2024 to reassess the situation and ensure ongoing support for Aino and Anna Mäkelä.
