---

**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted to assess the well-being of Aino Mäkelä, a single caregiver residing in Kinnula, Finland, who supports her elderly parent suffering from dementia. The primary objective was to evaluate the impact of Aino's substance abuse on her ability to provide adequate care for her parent and to identify potential risks within the household environment.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival, the residence appeared tidy, yet there were signs of neglect in certain areas, suggesting that Aino's substance abuse may have compromised her ability to maintain consistent care for her parent and home environment. The elderly parent, Mr. Mäkelä, was found in a state of disarray, unkempt, and visibly agitated, indicating an increased need for structured care and supervision.

Aino appeared fatigued and disoriented, displaying symptoms consistent with substance use. She admitted to using alcohol to cope with the stress of caring for her parent alone. Her emotional state was guarded, and she exhibited defensiveness when questioned about her substance use, highlighting a potential barrier to engaging in treatment.

**Assessment**

The high case severity is evident through Aino's admitted substance abuse, which directly impacts her capacity to provide essential care for her parent with dementia. The living conditions, while not dire, show signs of neglect due to Aino's compromised ability to manage household tasks effectively. There are significant risks associated with Mr. Mäkelä's unmet needs and the potential for his condition to worsen without proper care and supervision.

Family dynamics are strained, with Aino isolated due to shame surrounding her substance use, which prevents her from seeking external support. This isolation exacerbates her situation, creating a cycle of stress and substance abuse.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. Immediate referral to a local substance abuse treatment program tailored for individuals in similar circumstances, emphasizing the importance of addressing her issues to ensure she can continue providing care for her parent effectively.
   
2. Arrangement for respite care services to alleviate some of Aino's caregiving responsibilities, allowing her time to focus on her recovery and personal well-being.

3. Connection with a support group for caregivers dealing with substance abuse issues, fostering a sense of community and reducing feelings of isolation.

4. Follow-up visit in two weeks to assess Aino's engagement with the recommended services and to reassess her situation, ensuring ongoing support is provided as needed.

This report underscores the urgency for intervention to address both Aino's substance abuse and the critical care needs of her parent, Mr. Mäkelä, in Kinnula, Finland.
