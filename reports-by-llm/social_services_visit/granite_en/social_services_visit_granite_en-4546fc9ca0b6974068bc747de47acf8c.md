---

**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted to assess the disability support needs of Mr. Jari Koskinen, a disabled adult residing in Pyhäntä, Finland, with his live-in caregiver, Ms. Anna Koskinen. The high case severity indicates an urgent need for comprehensive evaluation and potential intervention to ensure the safety, well-being, and quality of life for both Mr. Koskinen and his caregiver.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at the Koskinen residence, I was greeted by Ms. Anna Koskinen, who appeared fatigued but cooperative. She provided access to their living space, which was modestly furnished and maintained. Mr. Jari Koskinen, confined to a wheelchair, was present in the living room. He showed signs of distress, with labored breathing and occasional discomfort. Ms. Koskinen explained that she had been managing his care independently for the past six months following their previous caregiver's resignation.

During our conversation, Mr. Koskinen expressed frustration due to limited mobility and inadequate assistance with daily activities such as bathing and dressing. Ms. Koskinen revealed that she was struggling to balance her part-time job with the demanding caregiving responsibilities, leading to sleep deprivation and stress-related health issues.

**Assessment**

The assessment indicates a high-severity case due to Mr. Koskinen's significant physical limitations, Ms. Koskinen's overwhelming caregiving burden, and the resulting strain on their overall well-being. The living conditions, while functional, lack essential adaptive features to accommodate Mr. Koskinen's disability effectively.

Risks identified include potential health deterioration for Mr. Koskinen due to inadequate care, and Ms. Koskinen's risk of burnout or exacerbated health issues from chronic stress. Family dynamics appear strained, with limited social support from extended family members residing abroad.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. Immediate referral to a home care service provider for comprehensive in-home assistance, including personal care, mobility support, and respite care for Ms. Koskinen.
2. Assessment by an occupational therapist to evaluate the home environment for necessary adaptive modifications.
3. Connection with local support groups or respite care facilities to alleviate Ms. Koskinen's caregiving burden and provide her with much-needed rest and social interaction.
4. Follow-up visit in two weeks to monitor progress, address any emerging concerns, and reassess needs.
5. Long-term planning involving vocational counseling for Ms. Koskinen to explore flexible employment options or training programs that accommodate her caregiving responsibilities.

This report serves as a starting point for addressing the complex needs of the Koskinen household, with the ultimate goal of enhancing their quality of life and ensuring Mr. Koskinen's safety and well-being.
