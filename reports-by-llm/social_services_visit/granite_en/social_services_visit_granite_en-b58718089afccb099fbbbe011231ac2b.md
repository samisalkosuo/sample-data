**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted as a follow-up to the parenting education program that Jari and Leena Pietilä participated in earlier this year. The purpose was to assess their progress, provide support, and ensure the effective implementation of learned skills in their daily family life.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at the Pietilä household, the environment appeared clean and organized. Jari and Leena greeted me warmly, displaying a cooperative and receptive attitude. The children were present during the visit and engaged in quiet activities, indicating a generally peaceful home atmosphere.

During our conversation, both parents demonstrated an understanding of the parenting strategies taught in the program. They shared specific examples of applying positive reinforcement and consistent discipline with their children. The family's interactions were respectful, and there was evidence of open communication between parents and children.

Notable concerns included occasional tension when addressing homework or chores, which the parents acknowledged as areas for further improvement. Overall, however, the family dynamics appeared stable and supportive.

**Assessment**

The Pietilä family exhibits low case severity, with a generally healthy and functional household. The parents' active participation in parenting education and their willingness to implement learned strategies are commendable. While there is room for improvement in managing daily routines and addressing occasional conflicts, the family's commitment to positive parenting is evident.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. Encourage the continued practice of positive reinforcement and consistent discipline techniques.
2. Schedule a follow-up visit in three months to assess progress and address any emerging concerns.
3. Provide resources on effective communication strategies for managing daily routines and resolving conflicts constructively.

The Pietilä family is advised to maintain open communication with social services and seek assistance when needed. With ongoing support, they are well-positioned to further enhance their parenting skills and strengthen family relationships.
