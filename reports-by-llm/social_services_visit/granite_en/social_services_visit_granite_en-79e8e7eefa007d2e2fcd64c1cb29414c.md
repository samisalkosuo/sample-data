---

**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This follow-up visit was conducted due to a reported case of high severity school truancy involving a child residing with a non-custodial relative, Aino Miettinen, in Tervola, Finland. The initial report indicated that the child had been absent from school for an extended period, raising concerns about their wellbeing and educational progress.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at Ms. Miettinen's residence, I was greeted by her and the child, 14-year-old Eemil Miettinen. The living conditions were adequate but showed signs of neglect, with clutter and unkempt areas. During our conversation, Eemil appeared withdrawn and reluctant to engage, displaying symptoms of potential emotional distress. Ms. Miettinen expressed understanding of her nephew's absence from school but lacked awareness of the severity and long-term implications.

**Assessment**

The assessment reveals a high-risk situation due to Eemil's prolonged school absence, which may indicate underlying issues such as emotional distress, learning difficulties, or family conflicts. The child's behavior during the visit suggests possible depression or anxiety, necessitating immediate attention. Furthermore, Ms. Miettinen's limited understanding of the situation and her inability to ensure regular school attendance pose additional concerns regarding Eemil's wellbeing and educational future.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. Immediate referral to a child psychologist for emotional assessment and support.
2. Collaboration with the local school authorities to develop an Individualized Education Program (IEP) addressing Eemil's specific needs and facilitating his return to education.
3. Engage Ms. Miettinen in parenting support services focusing on effective communication, understanding child development, and strategies for promoting school attendance.
4. Schedule a follow-up visit within two weeks to monitor progress and adjust interventions as necessary.
5. If required, escalate the case to the appropriate child protection authorities due to the high severity and potential risks identified.
