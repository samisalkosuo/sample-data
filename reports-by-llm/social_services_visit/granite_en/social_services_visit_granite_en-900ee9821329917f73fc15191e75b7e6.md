**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted as part of the ongoing refugee integration support program in Tervo, Finland. The purpose was to assess the well-being and needs of Aino M채kel채, a refugee mother with a newborn infant, and to provide necessary assistance and resources for their successful integration into the local community.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at Aino's residence, I was greeted by a visibly tired but friendly Aino, who warmly welcomed me into her home. The living conditions were moderately clean and organized, with basic furniture and essential household items. The newborn infant, Liisa, appeared healthy and content in her crib.

During our conversation, Aino expressed gratitude for the support received so far but also shared concerns about language barriers, limited social connections, and difficulties accessing healthcare services. She mentioned feeling isolated and overwhelmed at times, particularly when dealing with her infant's needs. Emotionally, Aino seemed resilient yet stressed, displaying a mix of determination and vulnerability.

**Assessment**

The current situation presents moderate challenges for Aino and her newborn daughter Liisa. While they have access to basic necessities, language barriers and limited social support hinder their integration into the local community. There is a risk of prolonged isolation, which could negatively impact both Aino's mental health and Liisa's development.

Family dynamics appear positive, with Aino demonstrating a strong commitment to her child's well-being. However, additional support is required to address language barriers, facilitate social connections, and ensure appropriate access to healthcare services.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. Arrange for language classes tailored to Aino's needs, focusing on essential communication skills for daily life and accessing local services.
2. Connect Aino with a local support group for refugee mothers to foster social connections and provide emotional support.
3. Schedule a follow-up visit within two weeks to assess progress in language acquisition and social integration, as well as any emerging needs or concerns.
4. Coordinate with healthcare providers to ensure Aino and Liisa receive necessary medical care and address any potential health issues promptly.
5. Provide information on available community resources, such as parenting classes, childcare support, and recreational activities for families.

By addressing these recommendations, we aim to enhance Aino's integration into the Tervo community, ensuring her well-being and that of her newborn infant, Liisa.
