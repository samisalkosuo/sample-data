---

**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted due to an urgent case of financial hardship experienced by a refugee family residing in temporary accommodation in Juuka, Finland. The purpose was to assess the family's living conditions, evaluate their immediate needs, and identify potential support services to alleviate their distress.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at Aisha Khan's residence, I observed a modest, clean, yet cramped living space. The family appeared to be in good health, though noticeably anxious and stressed. Aisha, the mother, expressed gratitude for the temporary accommodation but conveyed deep concern over their financial situation. Her husband, Khalid, seemed supportive yet overwhelmed by the pressure to provide for his family. The children, although well-nourished, displayed signs of restlessness and fatigue, likely due to the stressful environment.

**Assessment**

The family's urgent financial hardship is evident through their inability to afford basic necessities such as adequate heating, nutritious food, and essential clothing for the children. The temporary accommodation lacks privacy and space for the growing needs of the family. Emotional distress is palpable, with Aisha expressing feelings of helplessness and fear about their future in Finland.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. Immediate referral to a local food bank to address food insecurity for the family.
2. Connection with a social worker specializing in refugee support to provide emotional guidance and navigate available resources.
3. Application for emergency financial assistance through relevant government programs to cover essential living expenses.
4. Arrangement of a follow-up visit within one week to assess progress and address any new concerns or developments.
5. Exploration of long-term housing solutions, including potential eligibility for permanent accommodation or subsidized housing options.

This report underscores the urgency of the family's situation and emphasizes the need for swift intervention to prevent further deterioration of their well-being.
