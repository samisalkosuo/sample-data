**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This follow-up visit was conducted to assess the ongoing well-being and independence of Aino and Esko Koskinen, an elderly couple residing in Jämsä, Finland. The purpose was to evaluate their living conditions, health status, and social engagement following a previous low-severity case intervention.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at the Koskinens' home, both Aino (82) and Esko (85) greeted me warmly. Their living environment appeared clean, well-maintained, and safe, with necessary assistive devices such as a grab bar in the bathroom and a raised toilet seat. There were no signs of neglect or hazards.

During our conversation, Aino expressed satisfaction with their daily routine and mentioned participating in local senior centers' activities twice a week. Esko, who uses a walking stick due to mild mobility issues, reported no recent falls or injuries. Both clients demonstrated clear cognitive function, with Aino engaging in light household chores and Esko enjoying reading and gardening (indoors). Their emotional state appeared positive, with occasional laughter and shared memories.

**Assessment**

The Koskinens' living conditions are satisfactory, with minimal risk factors identified during this visit. Although Esko requires assistance with mobility, he remains independent in daily activities. Aino's engagement in social activities contributes positively to their mental well-being. There are no immediate concerns regarding their nutrition or personal hygiene.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. Encourage continued participation in senior center activities for both Aino and Esko, as these provide essential social interaction and cognitive stimulation.
2. Schedule a home health assessment to review Esko's mobility needs and explore potential assistive devices or modifications that could enhance his safety and independence further.
3. Arrange a follow-up visit in three months to reassess their living situation, health status, and any emerging needs.
4. Provide information on local transportation services for errands or medical appointments, should the couple require additional support in maintaining their independence.

This report reflects a low-severity case with the Koskinens demonstrating resilience and adaptability in their independent living arrangements. With ongoing support and resources, they are well-positioned to maintain their current level of functioning.
