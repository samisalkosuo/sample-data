---

**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted to assess the disability support needs of Aino Korhonen, a 45-year-old woman with moderate mobility limitations, and her 50-year-old brother, Mikko, who provides primary care for her. The purpose was to evaluate their living conditions, identify any support gaps, and recommend appropriate services to enhance their quality of life and ensure Aino's safety and wellbeing.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at the modest two-bedroom apartment on Kauppakatu, I was greeted by Mikko Korhonen. The living space appeared clean and organized, albeit somewhat cluttered due to Aino's mobility challenges. Aino, confined to a wheelchair, was present and communicated her needs clearly through sign language, with Mikko interpreting for her.

Mikko expressed concern over his sister's increasing difficulty in managing daily activities independently. He reported that Aino often experiences frustration due to her limited mobility, which hampers her ability to engage in social activities or pursue hobbies. The siblings' emotional state seemed strained, with Mikko appearing overwhelmed by caregiving responsibilities.

**Assessment**

The assessment revealed a moderate case severity primarily due to Aino's physical limitations and the resulting dependency on her brother for most daily tasks. While Mikko demonstrates dedication and love for his sister, his own wellbeing appears neglected, potentially leading to burnout or health issues in the future.

The current living arrangement, though functional, lacks essential accessibility features that could significantly improve Aino's quality of life and Mikko's caregiving burden. Notable concerns include:

1. Inadequate home modifications for wheelchair access (e.g., narrow doorways, lack of grab bars).
2. Limited social interaction opportunities for Aino due to mobility barriers.
3. Mikko's potential risk of caregiver stress and burnout.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. **Home Modification Assessment:** Arrange a consultation with an occupational therapist to evaluate necessary home adaptations, such as widening doorways, installing ramps, and ensuring bathroom accessibility.

2. **Respite Care Services:** Connect Mikko with local respite care options to provide him with temporary relief from caregiving duties, promoting his wellbeing and preventing burnout.

3. **Community Integration Program:** Enroll Aino in a community integration program that offers opportunities for social engagement, skill development, and recreational activities tailored to individuals with disabilities.

4. **Follow-up Visit:** Schedule a follow-up visit within three months to assess the implementation of recommended actions, evaluate changes in the siblings' wellbeing, and adjust support strategies as needed.

By addressing these recommendations, we aim to enhance Aino Korhonen's quality of life, alleviate her brother's caregiving burden, and foster a more balanced and sustainable living situation for both siblings in Hirvensalmi, Finland.
