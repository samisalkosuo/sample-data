---

**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted to provide substance abuse support to Aino Mäkelä, a refugee family currently residing in temporary accommodation in Toholampi, Finland. The purpose was to assess the family's living conditions, evaluate Aino's emotional state and behavior, and identify any notable concerns related to her substance abuse issues.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival, the family appeared clean and well-groomed. The temporary accommodation was modest but adequately furnished with basic necessities. Aino seemed cautious yet cooperative during the interaction. Her children, Emma and Oskari, were playing quietly in another room, indicating they were accustomed to their mother's occasional absences or preoccupation.

Aino disclosed that she had been under stress due to the challenges of adapting to a new country, learning the language, and finding employment. She acknowledged her recent relapse into substance use as a coping mechanism for these pressures. There were no signs of drug paraphernalia during the visit, but Aino's slightly unsteady hands and occasional fidgeting suggested possible residual effects from recent substance use.

**Assessment**

The family dynamics appeared stable, with Emma and Oskari showing typical behavior for their ages. Aino demonstrated awareness of her situation and expressed remorse for her relapse. The moderate case severity indicates that while the situation is concerning, it is not yet critical or posing immediate risk to the children's well-being. However, the potential for further substance abuse and its impact on family stability requires prompt attention.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. **Counseling Referral:** Arrange an urgent appointment with a local substance abuse counselor specializing in refugee support to address Aino's recent relapse and provide her with coping strategies tailored to her unique circumstances.

2. **Parenting Support Group:** Enroll Aino in a parenting support group focused on stress management and resilience-building for refugee parents, which can also offer peer support.

3. **Language Classes:** Facilitate enrollment in intensive Finnish language classes to empower Aino with better communication skills, potentially reducing stress and the temptation to resort to substance use as a coping mechanism.

4. **Follow-up Visit:** Schedule a follow-up visit within two weeks to reassess progress, provide ongoing support, and adjust interventions as necessary. 

This report underscores the importance of timely and culturally sensitive interventions to prevent escalation in Aino Mäkelä's substance abuse issues, ensuring the well-being of herself and her children within their temporary accommodation in Toholampi.
