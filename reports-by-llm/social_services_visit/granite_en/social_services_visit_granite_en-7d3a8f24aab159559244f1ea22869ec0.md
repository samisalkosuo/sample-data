---

**Summary of Visit Purpose:**
This follow-up visit was conducted on 22.10.2024 to assess the well-being and adjustment of the Pietilä family following their recent domestic relocation from Helsinki to Asikkala. The case severity was deemed low, indicating a stable family environment with minor adjustments expected post-move.

**Observations During the Visit:**
Upon arrival at the Pietilä residence, I was greeted by both parents, Jari and Leena, who appeared calm and composed. The family consists of six members: Jari (40), a construction worker; Leena (38), a part-time school assistant; and their four children aged 12, 9, 6, and 3.

The living conditions were satisfactory, with the family occupying a three-bedroom apartment in a newly built housing complex. The children's rooms were tidy, and there was evidence of ongoing efforts to personalize their new space with family photos and belongings. Leena mentioned that they have successfully enrolled all children in the local school, which has been well-received by the kids.

Jari expressed satisfaction with his new workplace, though he noted a slight reduction in hourly wages compared to Helsinki. Leena, while managing her part-time role effectively, mentioned challenges in finding suitable childcare for their youngest due to limited options in Asikkala. Emotionally, the family seemed adaptable and optimistic about their move, with occasional discussions about missing friends and familiar surroundings in Helsinki.

**Assessment:**
The Pietilä family demonstrates a low-severity case, indicating a generally stable environment despite recent relocation stressors. The children appear to be adjusting well to their new school and community. Financial concerns are minimal, with Jari's employment providing a steady income, albeit slightly reduced. The primary challenge identified is the limited access to childcare for their youngest, which could impact Leena's ability to work part-time.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up:**
1. Connect the family with local childcare resources and support groups to explore options for their youngest child, aiming to facilitate Leena’s continued part-time employment.
2. Schedule a follow-up visit in three months to reassess the family's integration into Asikkala, focusing on Leena's work situation and the children's ongoing school adjustment.
3. Provide information on community resources available in Asikkala, such as parenting classes or social events, to encourage further engagement and support network building.

This report concludes the assessment of the Pietilä family following their relocation. Further updates will be provided post-follow-up visit as per the recommended timeline.
