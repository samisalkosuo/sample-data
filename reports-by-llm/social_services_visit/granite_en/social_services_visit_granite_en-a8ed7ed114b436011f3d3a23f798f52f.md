**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted as part of the refugee integration support program to assess the living conditions and well-being of a 12-year-old child residing with their non-custodial relative, Aino Mäkelä, in Vöyri, Finland. The purpose was to evaluate the family's integration progress, identify any support needs, and ensure the child's safety and development within the moderate severity case context.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at Ms. Mäkelä's residence on Kauppakatu 12, the environment appeared clean and organized. The child, Sanna, was present during the visit and displayed a friendly demeanor. She engaged in conversation, expressing her interest in attending local school activities and learning Finnish. Ms. Mäkelä demonstrated a caring attitude towards Sanna, ensuring her participation in the discussion.

During the interview with Ms. Mäkelä, she expressed challenges in navigating the Finnish education system and accessing community resources for refugee support. She mentioned occasional feelings of isolation due to language barriers but emphasized her commitment to providing a stable home for Sanna. There were no immediate signs of distress or neglect; however, concerns regarding Sanna's emotional well-being emerged as she occasionally appeared withdrawn during the conversation.

**Assessment**

The assessment revealed a moderate severity case with a supportive relative providing care for the child. While Ms. Mäkelä demonstrates genuine concern and commitment to Sanna's welfare, there are noticeable gaps in her understanding of available resources and integration support services. The child appears to be adapting well socially but may benefit from additional emotional support to address potential feelings of isolation or adjustment difficulties.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. Connect Ms. Mäkelä with a dedicated refugee support worker who can provide guidance on navigating the Finnish education system, accessing community resources, and addressing language barriers.
2. Arrange for Sanna to participate in a local youth group or extracurricular activity to foster social connections and emotional well-being.
3. Schedule a follow-up visit within two months to reassess progress, address any emerging concerns, and ensure ongoing support is being effectively utilized by the household.
4. Encourage Ms. Mäkelä to seek individual counseling if needed to bolster her confidence in supporting Sanna's integration process.

This report aims to facilitate timely and appropriate interventions that promote the child's well-being, stability, and successful integration into Finnish society while addressing the relative's support needs.
