---

**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This routine family wellbeing visit was conducted due to the urgent case severity classification. The primary objective was to assess the living conditions, emotional state, and overall wellbeing of Aino Mäkelä and her three children residing in Puolanka, Finland.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at Ms. Mäkelä's residence, I was greeted by a visibly anxious single mother struggling to manage her three energetic children. The living conditions were substandard, with signs of mold and dampness on walls and peeling paint. There was limited furniture, and the children shared a single bedroom, which lacked proper storage for their belongings.

During our conversation, Ms. Mäkelä expressed feelings of isolation and overwhelm, mentioning difficulties in accessing essential resources such as food and childcare. The children appeared well-cared for but were visibly fatigued, likely due to sleep deprivation resulting from sharing a room.

**Assessment**

The assessment reveals an urgent need for intervention. The family is currently living in substandard housing conditions that pose health risks, particularly to the youngest child. Ms. Mäkelä's emotional state and admission of isolation indicate potential mental health concerns requiring immediate attention. Furthermore, the lack of access to basic resources like food and childcare exacerbates the family's vulnerability.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. Immediate housing assessment by the local social housing authority to address substandard living conditions.
2. Referral to a mental health professional for Ms. Mäkelä to assess and manage any potential anxiety or depression.
3. Connection with community resources, including food banks and temporary childcare services, to alleviate immediate resource-related pressures.
4. Arrange a follow-up visit within one week to monitor progress on these interventions and reassess the family's needs.
5. Collaboration with local schools to ensure the children's educational continuity and identify any additional support they may require.

This report underscores the urgency of the situation, necessitating swift action from relevant support services to safeguard the wellbeing of Aino Mäkelä and her children in Puolanka, Finland.
