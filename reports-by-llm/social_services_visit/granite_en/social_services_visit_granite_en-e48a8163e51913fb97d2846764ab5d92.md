---

**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted to assess the financial hardship faced by Aino Mäkelä, a teenage mother residing with her parents in Enonkoski, Finland. The high case severity indicates a critical need for support and intervention due to the family's precarious financial situation, which impacts their ability to provide essential resources for the infant.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at Aino Mäkelä's residence, the living conditions were noted as modest but adequate. The home was clean and organized, reflecting the grandparents' efforts to maintain a stable environment despite their financial constraints. Aino appeared fatigued yet attentive to her infant's needs. Her emotional state was subdued, possibly due to the stress of single parenthood and financial strain at such a young age.

The grandparents expressed concern over their limited income, which primarily comes from modest pensions. They mentioned recent job loss within the community, exacerbating their financial difficulties. Aino's infant appeared healthy and well-cared for, despite occasional signs of hunger that suggested inadequate food supply.

**Assessment**

The assessment reveals a family grappling with severe financial hardship, impacting their ability to meet basic needs. The grandparents' fixed income is insufficient to cover essential expenses, including diapers, formula, and nutritious food for the infant. Aino's young age compounds the challenges, as she lacks work experience and faces barriers to employment.

The family dynamics are supportive, with the grandparents demonstrating commitment to their grandchild's well-being. However, the strain of financial constraints is evident in their worried expressions and frequent discussions about money. The risk assessment indicates a potential for neglect or compromised health of the infant due to food insecurity and limited access to necessary resources.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. Immediate Referral to Food Bank: Arrange for the family to access a local food bank to ensure the infant's nutritional needs are met.
2. Employment Support for Aino: Connect with local employment services to assist Aino in acquiring work skills and finding suitable employment opportunities.
3. Financial Counseling: Refer the family to financial counseling to develop a budget, explore additional income sources, and manage existing debts.
4. Follow-up Visit: Schedule a follow-up visit within two weeks to reassess the family's situation and the effectiveness of implemented support measures.
5. Child Development Monitoring: Collaborate with local health services to monitor the infant's growth and development, ensuring no adverse effects from the current financial constraints.

This report underscores the urgent need for intervention to prevent potential harm to the infant and support Aino Mäkelä in navigating her challenging circumstances. Immediate action is crucial to mitigate risks and foster a stable environment for the family.
