**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This routine family wellbeing visit was conducted to assess the living conditions and emotional support provided to an 8-year-old child residing with their non-custodial relative, Aino Mäkelä, in Lohja, Finland. The purpose was to evaluate the overall family dynamics, identify any potential risks or concerns, and ensure appropriate care for the child within the context of a moderate severity case.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at Aino Mäkelä's residence in Lohja, the child, Elias Mäkelä, was present and appeared well-groomed. The living conditions were moderately clean, with adequate furniture and basic necessities provided. During our interaction, Elias displayed a positive demeanor, engaging in conversation and expressing enthusiasm about school activities.

Aino Mäkelä was cooperative and open to discussing the family situation. She expressed her commitment to providing for Elias's needs, including enrolling him in local extracurricular activities and ensuring regular attendance at school. However, it was noted that Aino works long hours as a night-shift nurse, which occasionally leaves Elias unsupervised for brief periods.

**Assessment**

The assessment reveals a generally stable environment with a caring relative providing for the child's basic needs. The child appears to be thriving emotionally and socially, demonstrating positive engagement with their surroundings and peers. However, the concern lies in Aino's extended work hours, which may pose occasional risks due to Elias's unsupervised time.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. **Support Services Referral:** Connect Aino Mäkelä with local childcare resources during her night shifts to ensure Elias has supervision and engagement when she is unavailable.
2. **Family Counseling:** Recommend family counseling sessions to address potential feelings of isolation or stress that Aino may experience due to her work schedule, which could indirectly impact Elias's wellbeing.
3. **Regular Follow-up Visits:** Schedule bi-monthly visits to monitor the implementation of support services and assess any changes in family dynamics or Elias's developmental progress.
4. **School Liaison:** Establish communication with Elias's school to ensure they are aware of the situation and can provide additional support if needed, such as tutoring or social activities during after-school hours.

This report aims to maintain a proactive approach in supporting Aino Mäkelä and Elias Mäkelä, ensuring that any emerging issues are swiftly addressed to uphold the child's wellbeing within this moderate severity case context.
