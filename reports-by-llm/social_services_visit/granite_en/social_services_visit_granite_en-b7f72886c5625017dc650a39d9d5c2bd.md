---

**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted to assess Aino Mäkelä's substance abuse situation and provide necessary support. As a disabled adult residing in Reisjärvi, Finland, with her niece Maria Koskinen acting as her live-in caregiver, the moderate severity of this case necessitated an in-person evaluation to ensure Aino's wellbeing and address any potential risks.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at Aino Mäkelä's residence, I was greeted by Maria Koskinen, who appeared attentive and caring towards her aunt. The living conditions were generally clean and organized, with some signs of neglect in certain areas, possibly due to Aino's substance abuse issues.

During our conversation, Aino seemed withdrawn and exhibited emotional distress. She admitted to consuming alcohol daily, which she uses as a coping mechanism for her disability-related challenges. Maria expressed concern over Aino's increasing reliance on alcohol and its impact on her health and ability to manage daily tasks.

**Assessment**

Aino Mäkelä's moderate substance abuse issue, primarily centered around daily alcohol consumption, poses risks to her physical health and overall wellbeing. The emotional distress she experiences is evident, and there are concerns about her ability to maintain a safe living environment for both herself and Maria Koskinen.

Family dynamics appear supportive, with Maria demonstrating dedication to her aunt's care despite the challenges. However, Aino's substance abuse necessitates immediate intervention to prevent further deterioration of her health and potential escalation of risks within the household.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. **Medical Evaluation:** Arrange for Aino Mäkelä to undergo a comprehensive medical assessment to evaluate the impact of alcohol consumption on her health, focusing on liver function and overall wellbeing.

2. **Substance Abuse Counseling:** Refer Aino to a local substance abuse counselor specializing in supporting individuals with disabilities. This should include both individual and possibly group therapy sessions to address her emotional distress and develop healthier coping mechanisms.

3. **Caregiver Support:** Provide Maria Koskinen with resources and support groups for caregivers of individuals with disabilities, particularly those dealing with substance abuse issues within the family. This will help her manage stress and maintain her wellbeing while supporting Aino.

4. **Follow-up Visit:** Schedule a follow-up visit in four weeks to reassess Aino's progress, review any changes in her condition, and ensure adherence to recommended interventions. 

By addressing these immediate needs, we aim to mitigate the risks associated with Aino Mäkelä's substance abuse and enhance the quality of life for both her and her caregiver, Maria Koskinen, in Reisjärvi, Finland.
