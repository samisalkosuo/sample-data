**Summary of Visit Purpose:**

This visit was conducted to assess the disability support needs of Aino Mäkelä, a teenage mother residing with her parents and infant in Somero, Finland. The purpose was to evaluate the family's current living conditions, identify any potential risks or challenges, and determine appropriate support services to ensure the well-being of Aino and her infant.

**Observations During the Visit:**

Upon arrival at the Mäkelä residence, I was greeted by Aino's parents, Jouko and Leena. The family appeared clean and well-maintained, with a cozy living environment. Aino was present and engaged in caring for her infant, demonstrating responsible parenting skills. The infant seemed healthy and content.

During our conversation, Aino expressed gratitude for her parents' support but mentioned occasional feelings of isolation due to her young age and limited social interactions. She also inquired about local parenting groups or activities for teenage mothers. Her emotional state was generally positive, with no signs of distress or anxiety.

**Assessment:**

The Mäkelä family's living conditions are satisfactory, with adequate resources and support from Aino's parents. The case severity is low, as the family demonstrates stability and functional coping mechanisms. However, there is a potential risk of social isolation for Aino, which could impact her mental health and parenting abilities in the long term.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up:**

1. Connect Aino with local parenting groups or activities designed for teenage mothers to foster social connections and provide emotional support.
2. Encourage Aino's participation in a parenting skills workshop to enhance her confidence and competence as a young mother.
3. Schedule a follow-up visit in three months to reassess Aino's needs, evaluate the effectiveness of recommended services, and address any emerging concerns.
