**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted to assess the needs and living conditions of an unaccompanied minor, a 14-year-old girl named Aiko Korhonen, who has recently been placed under the care of her rehabilitated ex-offender father, Jussi Korhonen. The purpose was to evaluate the suitability of the home environment and identify any support needs in light of the low case severity.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at Aiko's residence, a clean and modestly furnished apartment located on Kauppakatu in central Kurikka, I was greeted by both Aiko and her father, Jussi. The living conditions were found to be satisfactory, with basic amenities provided. Aiko appeared well-groomed and presented a calm demeanor during our interaction.

Jussi expressed remorse for his past actions and demonstrated a genuine commitment to providing a stable environment for Aiko. He spoke of attending regular rehabilitation programs and maintaining employment, indicating a positive step towards societal reintegration. There were no immediate signs of distress or concern in Aiko's behavior, suggesting she feels secure within the home.

**Assessment**

Given the low case severity, the current situation appears stable. Jussi's rehabilitation efforts and employment are positive indicators of his ability to support Aiko. The living conditions meet basic standards, and there were no evident risks or signs of neglect or abuse. However, ongoing support is recommended to address potential challenges associated with the father's past and to ensure Aiko's emotional well-being.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. **Counseling Services:** Arrange for Aiko to begin individual counseling sessions to process her feelings about her father’s past and to foster healthy emotional development.

2. **Parenting Support Groups:** Enroll Jussi in parenting support groups tailored for ex-offenders reintegrating into family life, to enhance his skills in nurturing and discipline.

3. **Community Engagement:** Facilitate Aiko's participation in local youth activities or clubs to encourage social integration and provide a positive peer environment.

4. **Follow-up Visit:** Schedule a follow-up visit in three months to reassess progress, adjust support strategies as necessary, and ensure continued stability for Aiko.

This report concludes with the understanding that while current circumstances are favorable, proactive measures will be crucial in sustaining Aiko's well-being and supporting her father’s ongoing reintegration process.
