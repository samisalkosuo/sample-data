**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted as part of the ongoing refugee integration support program in Laihia, Finland. The purpose was to assess the living conditions and emotional well-being of Aino & Jari Koskinen, a young couple expecting their first child. Given the moderate case severity, the visit aimed to identify any potential risks or challenges that may impact the family's integration into Finnish society.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at the Koskinens' residence, I was greeted by Aino and Jari, who appeared friendly and welcoming. The living conditions were moderately clean and organized, with basic furniture and essential household items. The couple expressed gratitude for the support they have received so far but also shared concerns about their upcoming parenthood and integration into Finnish society.

Aino, who is pregnant, appeared to be in good health, although she mentioned occasional morning sickness and fatigue. Jari, employed part-time at a local grocery store, expressed his eagerness to learn more about parenting and Finnish culture to better support his family. Both Aino and Jari demonstrated a positive emotional state, with evident excitement for their child's arrival.

Notable concerns include limited Finnish language proficiency, which may hinder their access to essential services and community engagement. Additionally, the couple expressed uncertainty about navigating the Finnish healthcare system and securing appropriate prenatal care.

**Assessment**

The Koskinen family's living conditions are adequate, but their moderate case severity indicates potential challenges in integration. Limited Finnish language skills pose a risk to their access of essential services and community involvement. Furthermore, the upcoming arrival of their first child necessitates additional support in understanding parenting responsibilities and navigating the Finnish healthcare system.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. Arrange for intensive Finnish language courses tailored to refugees, focusing on essential vocabulary related to healthcare, parenting, and daily living.
2. Connect Aino & Jari with a local community center offering cultural orientation programs and support groups for new parents.
3. Schedule a follow-up visit within two months postpartum to assess the family's progress in adapting to parenthood and integration efforts.
4. Coordinate with healthcare providers to ensure Aino receives appropriate prenatal care and postnatal support, including language assistance if necessary.
5. Encourage Jari's participation in vocational training or employment workshops to enhance his career prospects and contribute financially to the family.
