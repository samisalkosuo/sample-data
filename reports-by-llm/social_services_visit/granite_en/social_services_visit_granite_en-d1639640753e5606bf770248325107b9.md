**Summary of Visit Purpose:**
This visit was conducted as part of a routine refugee integration support check for an unaccompanied minor residing in temporary housing in Vesilahti, Finland. The purpose was to assess the living conditions, emotional well-being, and overall integration progress of Aiko Koskinen, ensuring that appropriate support services are being accessed and utilized effectively.

**Observations During the Visit:**
Upon arrival at Aiko's temporary housing apartment, I found a clean and orderly living space. Aiko, a 16-year-old girl from Syria, was present and engaged in studying for her upcoming Finnish language exam. She appeared well-groomed and showed enthusiasm about learning the local language, which is a positive sign of integration efforts.

During our conversation, Aiko expressed gratitude for the support services provided thus far, including language classes and vocational guidance sessions. She mentioned feeling safe in her temporary housing environment and having access to communal facilities such as a shared kitchen and laundry room, which fostered a sense of community among residents.

Aiko's emotional state seemed stable, with no signs of distress or anxiety evident during our interaction. She reported attending school regularly and participating in extracurricular activities organized for young refugees, indicating active engagement within the local community.

**Assessment:**
Given Aiko's positive outlook, consistent school attendance, and proactive approach towards language acquisition and skill development, her case severity is assessed as low. There are no immediate risks or concerns identified in terms of family dynamics, as she is an unaccompanied minor without dependent relatives present in Finland.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up:**
1. Continue monitoring Aiko's progress in language classes and vocational guidance sessions to ensure ongoing support in her integration journey.
2. Encourage participation in cultural exchange programs or mentorship opportunities that can further enhance her social connections within Finnish society.
3. Schedule a follow-up visit in three months to reassess her situation, particularly focusing on any potential changes in housing status and continued access to support services.
4. Maintain open communication channels with school authorities to track Aiko's academic performance and address any emerging educational needs.
