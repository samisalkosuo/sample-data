---

**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This homeless outreach visit was conducted due to an urgent case involving a single mother and her newborn infant residing without stable housing in Forssa, Finland. The purpose was to assess the immediate needs of the family, ensure the safety and well-being of the infant, and connect them with appropriate support services.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at the designated address, I found Aino Miettinen and her newborn in a small, makeshift shelter in a nearby park. The mother appeared exhausted but was attentive to her infant's needs. The living conditions were basic, with limited protection from the elements. Aino expressed gratitude for any assistance and shared that she had been staying in this temporary shelter for two weeks following an eviction due to unpaid rent. She mentioned attempting to access social housing but faced long waiting lists and stringent eligibility criteria.

The infant appeared healthy, though Aino expressed concern about the lack of privacy and potential exposure to environmental hazards in their current situation. Emotionally, Aino seemed resilient despite the challenging circumstances, displaying a strong determination to provide for her child. However, there was an underlying sense of urgency and stress evident in her demeanor.

**Assessment**

The assessment reveals an urgent case due to the immediate risks posed by the family's homelessness, particularly concerning the newborn infant's vulnerability to environmental factors and potential health issues arising from substandard living conditions. The lack of stable housing also impacts Aino's ability to seek employment or access essential services, perpetuating a cycle of disadvantage.

Family dynamics appear supportive, with Aino demonstrating a clear commitment to her child's well-being. However, the stress and uncertainty surrounding their living situation could have long-term implications for both mother and infant if not addressed promptly.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. **Immediate Shelter Placement:** Arrange emergency shelter accommodation to ensure the safety and basic needs of Aino and her infant are met, prioritizing locations with onsite support services for new mothers.

2. **Health Assessment:** Coordinate with local healthcare providers for a comprehensive check-up of the infant, focusing on potential developmental and environmental health risks associated with their current living conditions.

3. **Social Work Support:** Initiate regular social work sessions to address Aino's mental health, provide parenting support, and assist in navigating the complex process of securing permanent housing through available resources.

4. **Housing Application Assistance:** Offer guidance and support in completing housing application forms, including advocacy for expedited processing given the urgency of their situation.

5. **Follow-up Visit:** Schedule a follow-up visit within one week to monitor progress, reassess needs, and adjust support strategies as necessary.

This report underscores the critical need for swift intervention to prevent potential long-term negative impacts on both Aino Miettinen and her newborn infant due to their current homelessness in Forssa, Finland.
