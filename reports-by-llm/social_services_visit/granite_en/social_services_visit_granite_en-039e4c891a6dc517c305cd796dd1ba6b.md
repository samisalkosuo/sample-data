**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted as part of a refugee integration support initiative in Iisalmi, Finland. The purpose was to assess the living conditions and integration progress of Mikko Korhonen, a young adult refugee residing alone. Given the moderate case severity, the visit aimed to identify any immediate needs, evaluate the emotional state, and determine appropriate support services.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at Mikko's apartment, I was greeted with a clean and modestly furnished living space. Mikko, a 25-year-old male from Syria, appeared well-groomed and polite. He expressed gratitude for the visit and shared that he has been in Finland for two years following his arrival as an unaccompanied minor.

During our conversation, Mikko demonstrated a moderate command of the Finnish language, which he is actively learning through local adult education classes. He mentioned having part-time employment at a nearby grocery store but expressed concerns about limited work hours and low wages. Mikko also spoke of feeling isolated due to the lack of social connections with other Finns or fellow refugees, citing language barriers as a significant challenge.

**Assessment**

Mikko's living conditions are satisfactory, with basic necessities met. However, his moderate case severity indicates a need for targeted support in overcoming integration challenges. His part-time employment is a positive step, yet insufficient income poses a risk of financial strain and hinders his ability to engage in social activities or further language learning opportunities.

Emotionally, Mikko appears resilient but acknowledges feelings of loneliness and frustration due to limited social interaction and language difficulties. These factors could potentially escalate into more severe mental health concerns if not addressed promptly.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. **Language Support:** Enroll Mikko in intensive Finnish language courses to enhance his communication skills, facilitating better employment prospects and social integration.
2. **Employment Assistance:** Connect Mikko with a local employment agency specializing in refugee support to explore opportunities for full-time work or vocational training relevant to his interests and skills.
3. **Social Integration Programs:** Introduce Mikko to community centers or cultural exchange programs designed for newcomers, fostering social connections and reducing feelings of isolation.
4. **Mental Health Support:** Schedule a referral to a local mental health professional for ongoing emotional support and coping strategies, particularly focusing on addressing loneliness and integration-related stress.
5. **Follow-up Visit:** Plan a follow-up visit in three months to reassess Mikko's progress, adjust support services as needed, and provide continuous guidance through his integration journey.
