---

**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted to assess the needs and living conditions of Aino Mäkelä, an unaccompanied minor residing in temporary housing in Tammela, Finland. The purpose was to provide support related to substance abuse concerns, as indicated by the visit type.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at Aino's temporary housing unit, I observed a clean and organized living space, which suggested some level of self-care despite the challenging circumstances. Aino, a 16-year-old girl, was present and cooperative during our interaction. She appeared to be in good health but displayed signs of emotional distress, as evidenced by her fidgeting and occasional avoidance of eye contact.

Aino disclosed that she has been struggling with peer pressure to experiment with alcohol, which she described as a means of coping with feelings of loneliness and isolation in her temporary living arrangement. She expressed a desire for support in managing these emotions without resorting to substance use.

**Assessment**

The assessment reveals a moderate case severity due to the potential risks associated with Aino's experimentation with alcohol at such a vulnerable age. While she is currently not exhibiting severe substance abuse issues, the emotional distress and peer influence pose significant concerns for future development of more serious problems. The temporary nature of her housing further complicates her situation, as it lacks stability and consistent support systems.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. **Immediate Support:** Arrange a counseling session with a local mental health professional specializing in adolescent issues to address Aino's emotional needs and provide coping strategies that do not involve substance use.

2. **Peer Group Engagement:** Facilitate her enrollment in a youth group or club that promotes positive social interactions and offers structured activities, thereby reducing the influence of peer pressure related to alcohol.

3. **Long-term Housing Plan:** Collaborate with housing authorities to develop a long-term housing solution that provides stability and access to community resources, which are crucial for her ongoing support and development.

4. **Regular Follow-up:** Schedule bi-monthly visits to monitor Aino's progress, adjust interventions as necessary, and offer continuous support until she is better equipped to navigate these challenges independently.

This report will be shared with the relevant stakeholders, including Aino’s temporary housing provider and local healthcare services, to ensure a coordinated and comprehensive response to her needs.
