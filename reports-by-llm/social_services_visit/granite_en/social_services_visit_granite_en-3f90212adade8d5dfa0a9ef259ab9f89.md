**Social Services Visit Report**

**Client Name:** Aino Mäkelä
**Address:** Kauppakatu 23, 02100 Kauniainen, Finland

**Visit Date:** 10.05.2025

**Visit Type:** Emergency Housing Verification

**Case Context:** Teenager in Foster Care

**Summary of Visit Purpose:**
This visit was conducted due to an urgent housing verification request for a teenager currently under foster care in Kauniainen, Finland. The high case severity indicated an immediate need to assess the living conditions and ensure the safety and well-being of the young individual.

**Observations During the Visit:**
Upon arrival at Aino Mäkelä's residence, I was greeted by a 15-year-old girl named Anna, who appeared anxious and withdrawn. The foster home is a small apartment with limited space, shared with another foster child of similar age. The living conditions were minimal, with basic necessities present but in disarray. There was evidence of recent disturbances, including broken furniture and signs of emotional turmoil such as torn photographs and personal belongings scattered around the room.

Anna communicated that she felt unsafe due to ongoing conflicts between herself and the other foster child, which had escalated into physical altercations. She expressed a strong desire for stability and a more supportive environment. Her emotional state was fragile, with noticeable signs of stress and anxiety.

**Assessment:**
The assessment reveals a high-risk situation due to the unstable living conditions, interpersonal conflicts within the foster home, and Anna's expressed feelings of insecurity and vulnerability. The lack of a safe and nurturing environment is detrimental to her emotional and psychological development, especially given her tender age and the challenges associated with being in foster care.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up:**
1. Immediate relocation to a more suitable and stable foster home is recommended to ensure Anna's safety and provide a conducive environment for her emotional well-being.
2. Arrange a consultation with a child psychologist to address the trauma and anxiety she has experienced, offering therapeutic support tailored to her needs.
3. Coordinate with local schools or youth centers to facilitate Anna's social integration and provide additional emotional support through peer groups or extracurricular activities.
4. Schedule a follow-up visit within one month to assess the impact of these interventions and make further adjustments as necessary, ensuring continuous support for Anna’s transition into a more stable living situation.

This report underscores the urgency of Anna's case and the need for swift, comprehensive action to mitigate risks and foster her recovery and development in a secure environment.
