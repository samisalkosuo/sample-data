---

**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted to assess the financial hardship faced by Aino Mäkelä, a non-custodial relative caring for her 10-year-old niece, in Savonlinna, Finland. The purpose was to evaluate the living conditions, family dynamics, and potential risks associated with the reported moderate case severity.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at Aino's modest apartment, the child, Eeva Mäkelä, greeted me warmly. The living conditions were clean but showed signs of wear, indicating a limited budget for maintenance and replacements. Aino expressed gratitude for the visit and shared that she had been caring for Eeva since the child's mother faced unforeseen financial difficulties.

During our conversation, Aino openly discussed her struggles to make ends meet, citing reduced working hours due to Eeva's school schedule and increased expenses related to the child's extracurricular activities. She expressed concern about not being able to provide Eeva with the same opportunities as other children in the community.

Eeva appeared well-cared for, engaged, and displayed a positive emotional state despite the circumstances. However, Aino mentioned that she sometimes felt overwhelmed by her responsibilities and sought additional support to alleviate financial stress.

**Assessment**

The assessment revealed a moderate case of financial hardship within the household. While Aino provides a stable and loving environment for Eeva, the strain of limited resources impacts their quality of life. The primary risks identified include potential neglect of personal needs due to prioritizing Eeva's requirements and possible social isolation stemming from financial constraints.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. Connect Aino with local financial counseling services to develop a budget plan and explore additional income opportunities, such as part-time work or skill development programs.
2. Facilitate Eeva's participation in community-based extracurricular activities that offer scholarships or subsidized fees to ensure she maintains social connections and access to enrichment opportunities.
3. Schedule a follow-up visit within three months to reassess the family's situation, monitor progress, and provide ongoing support as needed.
4. Encourage Aino to join a local support group for non-custodial relatives facing similar challenges to foster a sense of community and shared experiences.

This report aims to address the identified concerns and empower Aino Mäkelä in managing her household's financial hardship while ensuring Eeva's well-being and development.
