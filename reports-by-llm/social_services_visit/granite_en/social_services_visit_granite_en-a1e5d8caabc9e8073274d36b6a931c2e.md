**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted as a routine child welfare check due to a reported neglect case within the two-parent household of Aino and Mikko Mäkelä. The purpose was to assess the living conditions, family dynamics, and the emotional well-being of the children residing in the home, ensuring their safety and addressing any potential concerns.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at the Mäkelä residence, the house appeared clean and organized. The parents, Aino (mother) and Mikko (father), greeted the social worker warmly and cooperatively. Their two children, 8-year-old Emma and 5-year-old Oskari, were present and engaged in quiet play activities.

During the visit, Aino prepared a simple lunch for her family, demonstrating basic caregiving skills. Mikko was present and interacted with the children, participating in their playtime. The children appeared healthy, well-fed, and content. Emma and Oskari displayed typical curiosity and enthusiasm for their toys and activities.

The emotional state of all household members seemed positive, with open communication between parents and children. There were no signs of overt distress or neglect during the observation period.

**Assessment**

Based on the observations, the case severity is considered low. The family appears to maintain a stable home environment, with basic needs being met. Parents Aino and Mikko demonstrated attentiveness towards their children's well-being and engaged in appropriate interactions. There were no immediate concerns regarding the children's safety or development.

However, it is noted that the parents may benefit from additional support to enhance their parenting skills and address any potential future challenges. The family resides in a rural area, which might present unique difficulties in accessing resources and services.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. Schedule a follow-up visit in three months to monitor the family's progress and address any emerging needs.
2. Offer parenting support workshops or classes focusing on positive discipline techniques, communication skills, and stress management for parents Aino and Mikko.
3. Provide information about local community resources, such as playgroups, educational programs, and recreational activities for children Emma and Oskari to foster their social development.
4. Encourage the family's participation in a parent-child interaction program to strengthen bonds and promote healthy child development.

By implementing these recommendations, the social services aim to empower the Mäkelä family, ensuring the children's continued well-being and addressing any potential risks proactively.
