---

**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted to review and update the support plan for Ms. Aino Mäkelä and her two children, aged 10 and 14, who have been living under the shadow of chronic domestic violence. The purpose was to assess their current situation, re-evaluate risks, and determine necessary adjustments to the existing support plan.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at Ms. Mäkelä's residence, I observed a relatively tidy living space, indicating some level of stability and effort towards maintaining normalcy despite their circumstances. The children appeared healthy and well-groomed, suggesting that their basic needs are being met. However, there was an underlying tension during our conversation, with Ms. Mäkelä appearing guarded and hesitant to discuss details of the domestic violence incidents. Her youngest child, a 10-year-old girl named Eeva, showed signs of anxiety, fidgeting and avoiding eye contact, which is indicative of potential exposure to ongoing trauma.

**Assessment**

The family's situation remains moderately severe due to the persistent nature of domestic violence. While there are no immediate safety concerns observed during this visit, the risk of escalation cannot be discounted given the history and Ms. Mäkelä's reluctance to fully disclose incidents. The children's emotional well-being is a significant concern, with Eeva's anxious behavior suggesting she may have witnessed or been affected by violent episodes.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. **Mental Health Support:** Arrange for immediate psychological assessments and counseling sessions for both children through the local child psychology services in Uusikaarlepyy. This should include trauma-informed care to address potential post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms.

2. **Domestic Violence Support Group:** Enroll Ms. Mäkelä and her children in a domestic violence support group facilitated by a trained professional, which can provide a safe space for sharing experiences and learning coping strategies.

3. **Safety Planning:** Conduct a comprehensive safety planning session with the family to identify triggers, develop escape routes, and establish communication protocols in case of emergency. This should be documented and reviewed regularly.

4. **Follow-up Visit:** Schedule a follow-up visit within two weeks to monitor progress, address any new concerns, and adjust the support plan as necessary. 

5. **Legal Consultation Referral:** Provide information about legal aid services available for victims of domestic violence, including assistance with restraining orders if deemed appropriate by Ms. Mäkelä.

This report underscores the need for ongoing, proactive support to ensure the safety and well-being of Aino Mäkelä and her children as they navigate through this challenging period.
