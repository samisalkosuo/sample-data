---

**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted to assess the risk of domestic violence and evaluate the living conditions for an unaccompanied minor residing in temporary housing, following a high-severity case report. The purpose was to understand the current situation, identify potential risks, and determine appropriate support services.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at Aino Mäkelä's temporary housing unit, I observed a 15-year-old girl, Sanna, who appeared withdrawn and anxious. The living conditions were basic but clean, with necessary amenities provided by the temporary housing facility. Sanna shared that she had been staying there for three months following her mother's eviction due to unpaid rent.

During our conversation, Sanna disclosed that her mother's new partner had been physically and emotionally abusive towards both her and her mother. She mentioned instances of verbal threats, pushing, and property damage. Sanna expressed fear for her safety and that of her mother, indicating a high-risk situation.

**Assessment**

The assessment revealed a high-severity domestic violence case with an unaccompanied minor at immediate risk. The family dynamics are characterized by ongoing abuse, fear, and isolation. Sanna's emotional state is compromised, displaying symptoms of anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

The mother, Aino Mäkelä, appeared overwhelmed and showed signs of recent physical injuries consistent with Sanna's abuse allegations. Despite her distress, Aino expressed a desire to protect Sanna and seek safety. However, she also revealed that the abusive partner had threatened to harm them if they left or sought help from authorities.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. Immediate Safety Planning: Collaborate with local law enforcement to ensure Aino and Sanna's safety, including potential restraining orders and increased police presence if necessary.
   
2. Specialized Counseling: Refer both Aino and Sanna to a trauma-informed therapist specializing in domestic violence and child abuse to address their emotional needs and provide coping strategies.

3. Legal Assistance: Connect the family with legal aid services to navigate issues related to housing, financial support, and potential custody arrangements, ensuring their rights are protected throughout the process.

4. Long-term Support: Engage a social worker for ongoing support, monitoring the family's well-being, and facilitating reintegration into stable, abuse-free living conditions.

5. Follow-up Visit: Schedule a follow-up visit within one week to assess progress, address any emerging concerns, and adjust the support plan as needed.

This report underscores the urgency of intervention in this high-severity domestic violence case involving an unaccompanied minor. Immediate and comprehensive support is essential to ensure the safety and well-being of both Aino Mäkelä and her daughter, Sanna.
