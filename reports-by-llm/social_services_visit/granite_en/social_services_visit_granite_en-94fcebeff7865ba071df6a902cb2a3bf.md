**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted as a follow-up to Mr. Jari Koskinen's recent domestic relocation, aimed at ensuring his successful adaptation to the new living environment following his mobility impairment. The low case severity indicates that while support is required, the situation does not pose immediate crisis or high risk.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at Mr. Koskinen's residence, I found him settled in a ground-floor apartment as previously arranged to accommodate his mobility needs. The environment appeared clean and well-maintained, with necessary adaptive equipment such as a wheelchair and a raised toilet seat installed.

Mr. Koskinen greeted me warmly, expressing gratitude for the support services provided during his transition. He seemed relaxed and engaged in conversation, demonstrating a positive emotional state despite the challenges of adapting to new living arrangements. Notable concerns included occasional difficulties with reaching upper shelves, which he managed with assistance from neighbors as needed.

**Assessment**

The assessment reveals that Mr. Koskinen is making a satisfactory adjustment to his new home. The living conditions are suitable for his needs, and he has established a supportive network within the community. There are no immediate safety risks identified, aligning with the low case severity classification. However, ongoing support in managing daily activities and potential future modifications to enhance accessibility could be beneficial.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. Schedule a home assessment by an occupational therapist to evaluate further adaptive measures that could improve Mr. Koskinen's independence in his apartment.
   
2. Connect Mr. Koskinen with local community groups focused on disability support and social activities to foster integration and reduce feelings of isolation.

3. Arrange a follow-up visit in four weeks to reassess his progress, address any emerging needs, and reinforce the support system established.

This report concludes with Mr. Koskinen's situation appearing stable under current support measures, but with clear recommendations for continued assistance to optimize his quality of life and ensure long-term independence within his accessible home environment.
