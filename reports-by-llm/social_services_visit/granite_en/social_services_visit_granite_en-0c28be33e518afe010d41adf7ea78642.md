**Summary of Visit Purpose:**
This visit was conducted as part of a routine assessment for the youth mentoring program. The purpose was to evaluate the living conditions and family dynamics of Aino Mäkelä and Jussi Kivinen, a young couple expecting their first child, in light of their moderate case severity.

**Observations During the Visit:**
Upon arrival at the neatly maintained apartment, Aino and Jussi welcomed me warmly. The living conditions were satisfactory, with a clean and organized space. Both appeared healthy and well-nourished. Aino expressed excitement about the impending arrival of their child, while Jussi demonstrated active involvement in preparations, such as setting up the nursery.

During our conversation, it was evident that they have a strong support network, including Aino's parents who live nearby and offer assistance. However, concerns were noted regarding financial stability, as Jussi recently lost his part-time job due to seasonal reductions in the local forestry sector. They are currently exploring alternative employment opportunities.

Emotionally, both appeared optimistic about their future, though understandable anxieties surrounding parenthood were apparent. There were no immediate safety concerns observed within the household.

**Assessment:**
Considering the moderate case severity, the family's situation appears stable despite financial uncertainties. The strong support system and proactive preparation for the child's arrival are positive indicators. However, the recent job loss poses a potential risk to their long-term stability. Immediate needs seem met, but sustained employment is crucial for their future well-being.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up:**
1. Connect Aino and Jussi with local employment services to assist in securing stable employment for Jussi, focusing on sectors less affected by seasonal fluctuations.
2. Schedule a follow-up visit in three months to reassess their financial situation and ongoing support needs.
3. Encourage participation in parenting classes offered through community centers to bolster confidence and preparedness for parenthood.
4. Maintain open communication channels for any emerging concerns or additional support requirements.

This report concludes the assessment of Aino Mäkelä and Jussi Kivinen under the youth mentoring program. Further actions are recommended to address identified risks and ensure the family's continued well-being.
