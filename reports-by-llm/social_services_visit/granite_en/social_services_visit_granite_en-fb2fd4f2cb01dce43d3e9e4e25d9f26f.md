**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted to evaluate the suitability and effectiveness of the current foster family setup for a teenager experiencing intermittent school attendance issues. The purpose was to assess the living conditions, family dynamics, and overall support provided to ensure the teenager's well-being and address the identified concern regarding educational engagement.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at the Korhonen residence in Kaustinen, a clean and organized environment was observed. The foster parents, Mr. and Mrs. Korhonen, were welcoming and displayed genuine concern for their teenage foster child, 16-year-old Aapo. During the conversation, it became evident that while Aapo's basic needs are met, there is a noticeable lack of structure around his daily routine, particularly concerning school attendance.

Aapo was present during the interview and appeared to be in good health, though somewhat withdrawn emotionally. He expressed understanding of the importance of education but cited peer pressure and a preference for leisure activities as reasons for occasional absences. The foster parents acknowledged these challenges and their efforts to encourage Aapo's school engagement through discussions and setting boundaries.

**Assessment**

The assessment indicates a low-severity case, primarily due to the absence of any immediate safety concerns or neglect. The home environment is stable and supportive, with clear rules and routines in place. However, the teenager’s school attendance issues suggest a need for targeted intervention to address underlying motivational or social factors contributing to his inconsistent presence at school.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. **School Collaboration:** Establish regular communication with Aapo's educational institution to understand the nature of his absences and collaborate on strategies to improve attendance, such as tutoring sessions or behavioral contracts.
   
2. **Counseling Referral:** Recommend a referral to a local youth counselor to address any underlying emotional or social issues that may be influencing Aapo's school behavior. This can provide him with tools for managing peer pressure and developing better time management skills.

3. **Family Support Group:** Encourage participation in a family support group focused on fostering teenagers. This will equip the Korhonens with additional strategies to navigate common challenges associated with adolescent behavior and reinforce positive parenting techniques.

4. **Follow-up Visit:** Schedule a follow-up visit in three months to reassess Aapo's school attendance, review progress with counseling, and evaluate the effectiveness of implemented strategies within the foster home environment.

This report concludes that while the current foster arrangement is appropriate and nurturing, targeted interventions are necessary to address Aapo’s school attendance issues effectively. With proactive engagement from both the foster family and recommended support services, it is anticipated that these measures will contribute positively to Aapo's educational journey and overall development.
