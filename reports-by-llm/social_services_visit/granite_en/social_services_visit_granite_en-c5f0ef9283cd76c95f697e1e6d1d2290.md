**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted as part of an ongoing immigration case monitoring process for Aino and Jussi Koskinen, a Finnish elderly couple who recently immigrated to Uurainen. The purpose was to assess their integration into the local community, living conditions, and overall well-being, given their moderate case severity.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at the Koskinens' residence, I was greeted by Aino, who warmly welcomed me into their cozy home. Jussi, her husband, joined us shortly after. Both appeared well-groomed and dressed appropriately for the weather. The living conditions were generally clean and tidy, with a few personal touches that suggested a comfortable environment.

During our conversation, Aino expressed gratitude for the opportunity to live in Uurainen but mentioned challenges in adapting to the new culture and language. Jussi, though quieter, shared concerns about his health, which had deteriorated since their arrival due to limited access to specialized medical care.

Emotionally, both appeared content but expressed feelings of isolation and loneliness, particularly Aino, who missed her social circle back in Finland. They mentioned attending a local senior center's activities sporadically, citing language barriers and transportation issues as deterrents.

**Assessment**

The Koskinens' moderate case severity is primarily driven by their struggle to integrate socially and access necessary healthcare services. While their living conditions are adequate, the lack of robust support networks exacerbates their feelings of isolation. Jussi's declining health poses an additional concern requiring immediate attention.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. Arrange for a language tutor to assist Aino in improving her Finnish and English skills, facilitating better community engagement.
2. Coordinate with local healthcare providers to ensure Jussi receives appropriate medical care, possibly including home visits if transportation remains an issue.
3. Encourage regular attendance at the senior center's activities, offering assistance with transportation needs where necessary.
4. Schedule a follow-up visit in four weeks to reassess progress and address any emerging concerns or requirements.

This report will be shared with relevant support services to ensure comprehensive care for the Koskinens during their integration process in Uurainen.
