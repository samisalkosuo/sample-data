**Social Services Visit Report**

**Client:** Aino Mäkelä
**Address:** Kauppakatu 12, Jämijärvi, Finland
**Visit Date:** 30.01.2025
**Visit Type:** Homeless Outreach Visit
**Household Composition:** Mother and Newborn Infant
**Case Severity:** Moderate

**Summary of Visit Purpose:**
This homeless outreach visit was conducted to assess the living conditions and immediate needs of Aino Mäkelä, a single mother with a newborn infant, in Jämijärvi, Finland. The purpose was to evaluate her situation, identify potential risks, and determine appropriate support services to address her moderate case severity.

**Observations During the Visit:**
Aino Mäkelä welcomed the social worker into her temporary shelter at a local community center. The living conditions were basic but clean, with a single bed for Aino and a makeshift crib for her newborn. Aino appeared tired but attentive to her infant's needs. She expressed gratitude for the support provided by the community center but also conveyed feelings of isolation and anxiety regarding her future prospects.

**Assessment:**
Aino's moderate case severity is primarily due to her lack of stable housing and the challenges of caring for a newborn alone. While she has access to basic necessities through the community center, there are concerns about her long-term stability and emotional well-being. The absence of a support network increases the risk of further deterioration in her situation.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up:**
1. **Housing Support:** Initiate a housing application process with the local municipality for permanent, safe, and affordable accommodation suitable for a young family.
2. **Parental Support Program:** Refer Aino to a parental support program to address her emotional needs and provide guidance on infant care.
3. **Financial Assistance:** Connect Aino with financial assistance services to help alleviate immediate economic pressures and facilitate her transition into stable housing.
4. **Community Integration:** Arrange for Aino's participation in community integration activities to build a support network and reduce feelings of isolation.
5. **Follow-up Visit:** Schedule a follow-up visit within two weeks to reassess progress, address any emerging concerns, and adjust the support plan as necessary.
