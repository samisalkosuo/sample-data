**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted to assess the suitability of Aino and Jussi Koskinen, an elderly couple residing independently in Suomussalmi, for participation in a local youth mentoring program. The purpose is to ensure that their living conditions, emotional well-being, and needs align with the program's objectives, while also evaluating potential benefits for both parties involved.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at the Koskinens' residence, I was greeted by Aino (78) and Jussi (80), who warmly welcomed me into their cozy home. The living conditions were clean, well-maintained, and safe, with no immediate signs of neglect or hazard. The couple appeared healthy, though Jussi required assistance with mobility due to mild arthritis.

During our conversation, both Aino and Jussi expressed a keen interest in engaging with younger generations through the mentoring program. They shared stories of their past experiences and highlighted their eagerness to impart wisdom accumulated over decades of living in Suomussalmi. Their emotional state was positive, and they displayed a strong sense of purpose and contentment.

**Assessment**

Given the low case severity, the Koskinens' independent living situation, good health (with manageable mobility issues), and clear motivation to participate in the mentoring program, there are no immediate concerns requiring intervention. Their home environment is stable, and they have a supportive network of friends and family in the community.

The proposed mentoring program aligns well with their desire for engagement and knowledge-sharing, potentially benefiting both the elderly couple and the participating youth by fostering intergenerational connections and mutual learning experiences.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. Proceed with enrolling Aino and Jussi Koskinen in the local youth mentoring program, ensuring they are matched with suitable young participants who share similar interests.
2. Schedule a follow-up visit within three months to assess the progress of the mentoring relationship, gather feedback from both parties, and address any emerging needs or concerns.
3. Maintain open communication channels between the Koskinens, their mentors, and social services to ensure ongoing support and adjustments as necessary.
4. Encourage Aino and Jussi to continue participating in community activities and events to further enrich their social connections and well-being.

This report concludes the assessment of Aino and Jussi Koskinen for the youth mentoring program. Should any unforeseen developments arise, please contact the undersigned for prompt attention.
