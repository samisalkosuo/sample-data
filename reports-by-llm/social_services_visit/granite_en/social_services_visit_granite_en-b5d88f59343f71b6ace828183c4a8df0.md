---

**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This post-abuse recovery support visit was conducted to assess the emotional wellbeing and living conditions of the Khan family following their recent relocation from a conflict zone. The purpose was to provide ongoing support, address any emerging concerns, and ensure access to necessary resources for their successful integration into Finnish society.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at the temporary accommodation in Finström, Aisha Khan greeted me warmly. The family appeared clean and well-groomed, indicating adequate access to personal hygiene facilities. The children were present and engaged, playing quietly with toys provided by local community support services.

Aisha expressed gratitude for the temporary housing but mentioned challenges in adapting to the Finnish culture and language. She reported no ongoing abuse from her husband, Omar, who seemed supportive during our interaction. The children appeared healthy and happy, with no signs of distress or unusual behaviors.

**Assessment**

The Khan family's living conditions are currently stable, with access to basic necessities such as food, shelter, and clothing. There were no immediate safety concerns or signs of ongoing abuse. However, the mother expressed feelings of isolation due to language barriers and cultural differences, which may impact her long-term mental health if unaddressed.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. Arrange a Finnish language course for Aisha Khan to enhance her communication skills and facilitate better integration into the community.
2. Connect the family with local cultural orientation programs to help them understand Finnish customs and social norms, reducing feelings of isolation.
3. Schedule a follow-up visit in four weeks to reassess progress, address any emerging concerns, and provide additional support as needed.
4. Maintain open communication channels with the family, encouraging them to reach out if they encounter difficulties or require assistance between scheduled visits.

This report reflects a low-severity case, but ongoing support is crucial for the Khan family's successful transition and recovery from past traumas. Regular follow-ups will ensure their needs are met and any potential issues are identified early.
