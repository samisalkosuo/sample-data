---

**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This follow-up visit was conducted due to a prior school truancy report concerning Aino Mäkelä's 12-year-old son, Jari. As Jari resides with his non-custodial parent, Aino, the purpose was to assess the living conditions and family dynamics, as well as to determine if there were underlying factors contributing to Jari's truancy.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at Aino Mäkelä's residence, I was greeted by both Aino and Jari. The home appeared clean and organized, with basic necessities readily available. Aino seemed cooperative and engaged in conversation, expressing her concern for Jari's school attendance.

During our discussion, Jari appeared withdrawn but responded appropriately to questions. He mentioned feeling overwhelmed by schoolwork and occasional conflicts with classmates. There were no immediate signs of neglect or abuse, and the living conditions met basic standards for a low-severity case.

**Assessment**

Based on the observations, Jari's truancy appears to stem from academic pressures rather than familial issues. Aino demonstrated a willingness to address the situation and sought assistance in supporting Jari's educational needs. The family dynamics seem stable, with no apparent risks identified during this visit.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. Arrange a meeting between Aino, Jari, and the school counselor to discuss strategies for managing schoolwork and resolving conflicts with peers.
2. Provide Aino with resources on local tutoring services or study groups that can help Jari improve his academic performance and build confidence.
3. Schedule a follow-up visit in four weeks to assess progress and address any emerging concerns.
