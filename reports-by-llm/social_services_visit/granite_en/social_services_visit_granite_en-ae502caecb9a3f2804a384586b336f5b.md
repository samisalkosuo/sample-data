**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted to assess the living conditions and parental supervision of Aini Pitkäranta, a single parent residing in Kihniö, Finland, who is battling substance use disorder. The primary objective was to evaluate the impact of her condition on her children's well-being and safety during visitation periods.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at Aini Pitkäranta's residence, the living conditions appeared adequate but showed signs of neglect due to the parent's substance use disorder. The home was clean, yet basic necessities like fresh food and proper storage were scarce. Aini's two children, 8-year-old Elias and 5-year-old Mia, were present during the visit.

Aini appeared lethargic and disoriented, displaying symptoms consistent with substance use. She managed to engage with her children, but her interactions lacked focus and energy. The children seemed aware of their mother's condition, often seeking reassurance and guidance from each other. Elias demonstrated responsibility by ensuring Mia's safety during unsupervised moments.

**Assessment**

The high case severity is primarily driven by Aini's substance use disorder, which poses significant risks to her children's physical and emotional well-being. The neglected living conditions, although not immediately dangerous, indicate a potential for harm if left unaddressed. The children exhibit resilience but require immediate support to mitigate the adverse effects of their mother's condition.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. Immediate referral to an inpatient substance abuse treatment program for Aini Pitkäranta, with a clear timeline for enrollment within one week.
2. Arrange for regular supervised visitation at a community center to ensure the children's safety and well-being during parental contact.
3. Initiate family therapy sessions focusing on substance abuse recovery and improved parenting skills.
4. Coordinate with local social services to provide essential household items and establish a support network for Aini post-treatment.
5. Schedule a follow-up visit within two weeks to reassess progress and adjust interventions as necessary.

This report underscores the urgency of addressing Aini Pitkäranta's substance use disorder to safeguard her children's immediate and long-term welfare.
