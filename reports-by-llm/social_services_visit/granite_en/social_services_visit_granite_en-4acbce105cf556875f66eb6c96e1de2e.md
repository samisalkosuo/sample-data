**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This follow-up visit was conducted in response to a reported case of school truancy involving the minor child of Aino and Jussi Korhonen, an elderly couple residing independently in Laitila, Finland. The case severity was deemed low, indicating minimal risk to the child's well-being.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at the Korhonen residence, I was greeted by Aino and Jussi, who appeared to be in good health and spirits. The living conditions were clean and well-maintained, with no immediate safety hazards identified. The couple's interactions were respectful and affectionate, suggesting a stable home environment.

During our conversation, both parents expressed their concern for their grandchild's recent absenteeism from school. They mentioned that the child had been experiencing some difficulties adjusting to the new school year, citing peer pressure as a contributing factor. The child, who was present during the visit, appeared to be in good emotional health and engaged in the conversation.

**Assessment**

The assessment of the situation reveals a low-severity case primarily driven by social factors rather than any significant risk to the child's well-being. The family dynamics are stable, with Aino and Jussi demonstrating a clear commitment to their grandchild's welfare. The reported truancy appears to be a temporary issue stemming from the child's struggle to adapt to social pressures at school.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

Given the low severity of this case, it is recommended that the family be provided with resources to address the child's social challenges. I suggest arranging a meeting between the Korhonens and the school counselor to discuss strategies for improving their grandchild's school attendance and peer relationships. Additionally, connecting the family with local community support groups focused on youth development could further assist in addressing any underlying issues.

A follow-up visit is recommended in four weeks to assess progress and provide ongoing support as needed. Should there be no improvement or if new concerns arise before this scheduled follow-up, the case should be reassessed promptly.
