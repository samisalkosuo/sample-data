---

**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted as part of a routine juvenile probation compliance check, focusing on a teenager residing in Riihimäki, Finland, who has been experiencing school attendance issues. The purpose was to assess the living conditions, evaluate the teenager's emotional state, and determine adherence to probation terms.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at Aapo Koskinen's residence, I was greeted by Mr. Koskinen, the legal guardian. The home appeared clean and organized, with adequate resources for daily living. Aapo, a 16-year-old male, was present during the visit. He seemed withdrawn but cooperative, answering questions directly when prompted.

During our conversation, Mr. Koskinen expressed concern over his son's recent school absences, attributing them to a lack of motivation rather than any significant behavioral issues. Aapo confirmed this, stating he finds schoolwork challenging and uninteresting. No immediate safety concerns or signs of substance abuse were observed.

**Assessment**

The current situation presents moderate risk factors primarily due to Aapo's inconsistent school attendance, which may indicate underlying emotional distress or learning difficulties not yet addressed. While the home environment appears stable and supportive, there is a need for intervention to improve Aapo's engagement with education.

Family dynamics seem healthy, with Mr. Koskinen demonstrating a willingness to cooperate and seek solutions. However, the moderate case severity suggests that professional evaluation of Aapo's academic struggles and emotional well-being is warranted.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. Arrange for Aapo Koskinen to undergo a comprehensive psychological assessment to identify any learning disabilities or emotional factors contributing to his school avoidance.
2. Facilitate an educational consultation with school authorities and Aapo to explore strategies for enhancing his motivation and addressing any academic challenges.
3. Schedule a follow-up visit in four weeks to review progress on these interventions and reassess Aapo's compliance with probation terms, ensuring ongoing support and adherence.
4. Provide Mr. Koskinen with resources on parenting strategies for supporting teenagers facing educational hurdles, fostering open communication channels between guardian and child.

This report will be shared with the juvenile probation officer overseeing Aapo's case for coordinated action and support provision.
