---

**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This routine family wellbeing visit was conducted to assess the living conditions, emotional state, and overall functioning of the separated couple, Aino and Jari Mäkelä, who share custody of their two children. The critical case severity indicates a heightened risk for the family's wellbeing, necessitating immediate attention and intervention.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at the Mäkelä residence, I observed a tense atmosphere between Aino and Jari. They exchanged brief, strained greetings before separating to their respective areas of the home. The children, visibly anxious, remained close to their mother, Aino.

The living conditions were minimal, with signs of financial hardship evident in the sparsely furnished rooms and lack of essential household items. There was a noticeable shortage of food supplies, and the children appeared malnourished. The home's cleanliness was subpar, raising concerns about potential health hazards.

Aino expressed feelings of isolation and despair, attributing her situation to an inability to secure stable employment following the separation. Jari, on the other hand, seemed preoccupied with his work commitments, displaying little engagement with the family's immediate needs. Both parents displayed signs of emotional distress, with Aino exhibiting symptoms of depression and Jari showing signs of anxiety.

**Assessment**

The critical case severity is primarily driven by the family's precarious living conditions, financial instability, and the parents' compromised mental health. The children's malnourishment and visible distress further exacerbate the situation. The strained interactions between Aino and Jari indicate a high risk of domestic conflict escalation, potentially endangering the children's safety and wellbeing.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. Immediate referral to a local food bank for emergency food supplies to address malnourishment.
2. Arrange for a mental health assessment for both parents through the regional psychological services, prioritizing Aino's depression and Jari's anxiety.
3. Connect the family with a financial counselor specializing in employment support and budgeting to alleviate financial strain.
4. Initiate a collaborative parenting workshop focused on effective communication and conflict resolution strategies for Aino and Jari, aiming to minimize domestic tension and its impact on the children.
5. Schedule a follow-up visit within one week to monitor progress and address any emerging concerns or needs.
6. If necessary, escalate the case to child protective services due to the critical severity and potential risk to the children's wellbeing.

This report underscores the urgent need for intervention to safeguard the Mäkelä family's wellbeing and prevent further deterioration of their living conditions and mental health.
