---

**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted as part of the ongoing refugee integration support program, focusing on assisting a single adult with an intellectual disability. The purpose was to assess their living conditions, evaluate their integration progress, and identify any support needs within the context of moderate case severity.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at Mikko Korhonen's residence in Keitele, Tampere, the environment appeared clean and organized, albeit modestly furnished. Mikko, a 32-year-old individual with an intellectual disability, greeted me warmly. He demonstrated basic self-care skills but required assistance with meal preparation and managing finances.

During our interaction, Mikko expressed a desire to improve his language skills and engage more actively in the community. However, he also conveyed feelings of isolation due to communication barriers and limited social opportunities. His emotional state was generally calm, though there were moments of frustration evident when navigating daily tasks independently.

**Assessment**

Mikko's living conditions are adequate but could benefit from additional support in managing finances and accessing community resources. His moderate case severity indicates a need for targeted interventions to enhance his integration into Finnish society. While he shows motivation to learn and participate, his intellectual disability poses challenges in overcoming language barriers and building social connections.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. **Language Support:** Arrange enrollment in a beginner's Finnish language course tailored for individuals with intellectual disabilities. This should commence within the next two weeks to capitalize on Mikko's expressed desire for improvement.

2. **Financial Management Workshop:** Organize a session with a financial advisor specializing in supporting individuals with intellectual disabilities. This workshop should address budgeting, bill payments, and understanding financial transactions. Schedule this for the third week of September to allow ample preparation time.

3. **Community Integration Program:** Connect Mikko with local community groups that offer activities suitable for individuals with varying abilities. Encourage participation in these groups to foster social interaction and a sense of belonging, starting from the fourth week of September.

4. **Follow-up Visit:** Schedule a follow-up visit in two months to reassess progress, address any emerging concerns, and adjust support strategies as necessary.

This report encapsulates the findings and recommendations derived from today's visit to Mikko Korhonen in Keitele, Tampere. It aims to provide a structured pathway for enhancing his integration into Finnish society while addressing his specific needs stemming from his intellectual disability.
