**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted due to an emergency housing verification request from Aino Mäkelä, a single parent residing in Paltamo, Finland, following recent custody changes for her blended family. The case severity is moderate, indicating the need for immediate attention and support.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at Aino's residence, I observed a modest two-bedroom apartment with basic furnishings. Aino, a 38-year-old mother of two, appeared anxious but cooperative during our interaction. Her children, 10-year-old Emil and 7-year-old Anna, were present and seemed to be adjusting to the recent custody changes.

The living conditions were generally clean, although there was a noticeable lack of personal belongings, suggesting potential financial constraints. Aino expressed concerns about maintaining stability for her children amidst the transition. Emotions ranged from apprehension to hope, reflecting the family's adaptability in challenging circumstances.

**Assessment**

The family's moderate case severity stems from the recent custody changes and the resulting housing instability. Aino's primary concern is ensuring a secure and nurturing environment for her children. While there are no immediate safety risks, the lack of financial resources poses a risk to their long-term stability. The family dynamics indicate resilience, with Aino demonstrating commitment to her children's well-being despite the challenges.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. **Financial Assistance:** Refer Aino to local social welfare services for potential financial support, including housing subsidies or employment assistance programs.
   
2. **Counseling Services:** Arrange for family counseling to address the emotional impact of custody changes and facilitate a smoother transition for all involved.

3. **Community Resources:** Connect Aino with community support groups for single parents and blended families to foster a sense of belonging and shared experiences.

4. **Follow-up Visit:** Schedule a follow-up visit in four weeks to assess progress, reevaluate needs, and provide ongoing support.

This report underscores the urgency of addressing Aino Mäkelä's situation to prevent potential deterioration of her family's circumstances. Immediate intervention through the recommended actions will help mitigate risks and promote the children's well-being.
