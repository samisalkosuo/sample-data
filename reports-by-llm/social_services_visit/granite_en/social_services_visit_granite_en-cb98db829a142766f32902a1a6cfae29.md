---

**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This post-abuse recovery support visit was conducted in response to an urgent case involving a family with a documented history of chronic domestic violence. The purpose was to assess the current living conditions, emotional wellbeing of each household member, and identify immediate safety concerns following a recent incident of abuse.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at Aino Miettinen's residence in Lieto, Finland, I was greeted by Aino, who appeared visibly shaken but relieved to see the social worker. The children, Anna (12) and Olli (8), were present and seemed cautious yet curious about my presence. Jussi Miettinen was absent from the home, as per Aino's statement, due to a temporary restraining order following the recent violent incident.

The living conditions were minimal but adequate, with basic necessities provided. There were signs of recent cleaning efforts, suggesting an attempt to regain normalcy after the traumatic event. However, the atmosphere was tense, and Aino's emotional state was fragile, evident through her trembling hands and frequent pauses while speaking.

Anna demonstrated a concerning level of maturity, often taking on a protective role towards her younger brother Olli, who appeared more withdrawn and fearful. Both children expressed anxiety about Jussi's potential return, highlighting their ongoing safety concerns.

**Assessment**

The family is currently in an urgent situation due to the recent history of domestic violence and the immediate threat posed by Jussi Miettinen's absence from the home rather than a permanent solution. The children exhibit signs of emotional distress, with Anna displaying protective behaviors indicative of having witnessed or experienced abuse herself.

The family dynamics are strained, with Aino struggling to maintain control and provide reassurance amidst her own fear and trauma. The absence of Jussi, while enforcing legal protection, does not alleviate the underlying issues of chronic violence and the psychological impact on all household members.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. **Immediate Safety Planning:** Collaborate with local law enforcement to ensure ongoing monitoring and support for Aino and the children, including regular check-ins to assess safety and provide reassurance.
   
2. **Counseling Services:** Arrange for family therapy sessions with a trauma-informed counselor specializing in domestic violence recovery to address the emotional needs of Aino, Anna, and Olli.

3. **Legal Advocacy:** Connect the family with legal aid services to navigate the restraining order process, custody arrangements, and long-term protection measures against Jussi Miettinen.

4. **Support Groups:** Enroll Aino in a support group for survivors of domestic abuse to foster resilience and provide a community of shared experience.

5. **Follow-up Visits:** Schedule bi-weekly visits over the next month to monitor progress, adjust interventions as necessary, and offer ongoing support.

This urgent case requires swift and comprehensive action to ensure the safety and wellbeing of Aino Miettinen and her children. Continuous collaboration with law enforcement, legal advisors, mental health professionals, and community resources is essential for effective long-term recovery from domestic abuse.
