---

**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This follow-up visit was conducted due to a reported case of school truancy involving Jari Koskinen's son, Eemil. The initial report indicated that Eemil had been absent from school without a valid reason for several days. As the case severity is low and there are no immediate safety concerns, the purpose of this visit was to assess the family's situation, understand the reasons behind Eemil's truancy, and provide appropriate support if necessary.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at Jari Koskinen's residence, I was greeted by Mr. Koskinen who appeared well-groomed and spoke coherently about his son's situation. The living conditions were clean and adequately maintained, with evidence of regular household chores. Eemil, aged 12, was present during the conversation and displayed a generally calm demeanor.

During our discussion, Mr. Koskinen explained that Eemil had been experiencing some difficulties at school, specifically with a bullying incident involving another student. He mentioned feeling helpless in addressing this issue directly with the school due to his single parent status and limited social connections in Nousiainen. As a result, Eemil had started skipping school to avoid further confrontations.

**Assessment**

The family dynamics appeared stable, with Mr. Koskinen demonstrating clear concern for his son's well-being. There were no signs of neglect or abuse, and the home environment seemed supportive. The case severity remains low, primarily due to the absence being triggered by a specific, addressable issue rather than indicative of deeper familial problems or significant risk factors.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. **School Liaison:** I will contact Eemil's school to discuss the bullying incident and ensure appropriate measures are taken to protect him. This includes facilitating a meeting between Mr. Koskinen, school authorities, and possibly a mediator if necessary.

2. **Counseling Support:** Given Eemil's emotional distress due to bullying, I recommend arranging for him to receive counseling services through the local youth mental health clinic in Nousiainen. This will help him develop coping strategies and improve his resilience.

3. **Parent Support Group:** Mr. Koskinen may benefit from joining a parent support group, either in person or online, to connect with other single parents facing similar challenges. This can provide him with practical advice and emotional support.

4. **Follow-up Visit:** Schedule another visit in four weeks to assess the effectiveness of these interventions and address any new concerns that may arise.

In conclusion, while Eemil's truancy was triggered by a specific incident, it is crucial to proactively address both his immediate needs and those of his father to prevent future absences. The recommended actions aim to resolve the current issue and equip the family with resources for managing similar situations in the future.
