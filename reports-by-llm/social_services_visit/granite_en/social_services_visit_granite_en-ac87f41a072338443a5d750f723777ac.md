**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted as part of the routine check-in for veteran support services. The purpose was to assess the well-being of the separated couple, Jari Koskinen and his ex-spouse, Anna Pitk채nen, who share custody of their two children following Jari's military service.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at the designated address, I was greeted by Mr. Koskinen. He appeared well-groomed and in good health. The living conditions were clean and organized, with evidence of shared custody arrangements, such as children's belongings present during his time. Both children were engaged in their activities, indicating a stable home environment.

During our conversation, Mr. Koskinen expressed gratitude for the support services provided, acknowledging the challenges of transitioning back to civilian life after military service. He reported a collaborative co-parenting relationship with Ms. Pitk채nen, emphasizing their commitment to their children's well-being. There were no immediate concerns regarding safety or neglect observed.

**Assessment**

The family dynamics appear stable and supportive, with clear communication between the separated parents. The low case severity indicates that the family is managing well despite the separation. Mr. Koskinen's emotional state was positive, and he demonstrated resilience in adapting to his new life circumstances. There are no identified risks or urgent needs at this time.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

Given the current stable situation, it is recommended that Mr. Koskinen continue receiving veteran support services for ongoing emotional and practical assistance as needed. A follow-up visit in three months is suggested to monitor any changes in circumstances and to provide additional support if required. 

In addition, it may be beneficial for the family to participate in community-based activities or workshops designed for veterans and their families to foster social connections and shared experiences. 

This report will be shared with the relevant support service coordinators to ensure continuity of care and any necessary adjustments to the support plan.
