---

**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This at-risk youth intervention visit was conducted due to concerns regarding the wellbeing of Aino Korhonen, an elderly resident of Ylöjärvi, Finland, who is exhibiting early symptoms of dementia. The urgency of this case stems from the potential risks associated with her cognitive decline and the need for immediate support to ensure her safety and maintain a stable home environment.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at Ms. Korhonen's residence, I observed a clean but cluttered living space, indicative of potential difficulties in maintaining order due to her cognitive impairment. Ms. Korhonen appeared disoriented and confused, struggling to recall recent events or provide coherent responses to simple questions. Her emotional state was fluctuating between agitation and passivity, which may be linked to her dementia progression.

During the visit, there were no signs of any at-risk youth present. However, Ms. Korhonen mentioned living with her granddaughter, Sanna, a young adult who was not at home during this visit. Sanna's absence raised concerns about potential neglect or inadequate support for Ms. Korhonen, given the urgency of the situation.

**Assessment**

The assessment reveals that Aino Korhonen is in an urgent need of support due to her early-stage dementia. The living conditions, while not immediately hazardous, pose risks for falls and accidents as clutter accumulates. Her cognitive decline significantly impacts her ability to manage daily tasks and maintain personal safety without consistent assistance.

The absence of Sanna during the visit suggests a possible lack of regular care or understanding of Ms. Korhonen's deteriorating condition, which could lead to further deterioration in her health and wellbeing. The family dynamics appear strained, with potential for increased burden on Sanna if she is the primary caregiver without adequate external support.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. **Immediate Referral:** Arrange for a geriatric assessment to evaluate Ms. Korhonen's cognitive and physical health comprehensively. This will help in planning appropriate care strategies, including potential medication reviews and therapeutic interventions.

2. **Home Care Services:** Initiate a home care service to provide daily assistance with personal care, meal preparation, and household management. This will alleviate immediate safety risks and offer Ms. Korhonen the support she needs to maintain her independence for longer.

3. **Family Support and Education:** Organize a family meeting involving Sanna to discuss dementia care strategies, available resources, and the importance of consistent support for both Ms. Korhonen and herself. Provide educational materials on dementia progression and coping mechanisms.

4. **Follow-up Visits:** Schedule bi-weekly visits to monitor Ms. Korhonen's condition, assess the effectiveness of interventions, and ensure ongoing support for Sanna in managing her grandmother’s care needs.

5. **Community Resources:** Connect the family with local dementia support groups and respite care options to prevent caregiver burnout and foster a sense of community among those facing similar challenges.

This report underscores the urgent need for intervention to safeguard Ms. Korhonen's wellbeing and ensure sustainable care practices within her household. Prompt action is essential to mitigate risks associated with dementia progression and maintain a supportive environment for all involved parties.
