**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted as a routine child welfare check to assess the living conditions and well-being of a single father and his child in Sulkava, Finland. The purpose was to ensure the child's safety, health, and overall development are satisfactory, given the low case severity indication.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at Jari Koskinen's residence on Kauppakatu 12, the environment appeared clean and organized. The living space was modest but adequately furnished for the father and his 7-year-old son, Elias. During our interaction, Jari was cooperative and engaged, demonstrating a clear bond with Elias.

Elias seemed healthy, well-nourished, and actively participated in our conversation. He displayed typical curiosity for his age and appeared to thrive in a stable, nurturing environment. Jari expressed concern over Elias's recent behavioral changes at school but assured that he is addressing these matters with the educational institution.

**Assessment**

The assessment of this low-severity case reveals a functional family unit with adequate living conditions and apparent emotional stability. Jari demonstrates responsible parenting, albeit facing minor challenges in managing his child's behavioral adjustments at school. There are no immediate risks to the child's welfare identified during this visit.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. Encourage Jari to continue open communication with Elias’s school to address behavioral concerns effectively.
2. Recommend a parenting support group in Sulkava, which could provide Jari with additional strategies for managing child behavior and fostering positive development.
3. Schedule a follow-up visit in three months to reassess the family's situation and ensure ongoing support is beneficial.
4. Provide Jari with information about local community resources, such as playgroups or extracurricular activities, to enrich Elias’s social development.

This report concludes that while the current situation is satisfactory, proactive engagement with available support services could further enhance family dynamics and child development.
