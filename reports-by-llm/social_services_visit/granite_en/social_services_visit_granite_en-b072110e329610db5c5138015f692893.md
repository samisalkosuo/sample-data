**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This homeless outreach visit was conducted to assess the living conditions and emotional well-being of Aino M채kel채, a 16-year-old teenager currently in foster care. The purpose was to evaluate the moderate severity of her case, identify any immediate needs, and determine appropriate support services.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at Aino's temporary foster home, I was greeted by her foster mother, Ms. Leena Koskinen. The residence is a modest apartment in a shared living arrangement with another foster family. The environment appeared clean and tidy, but space was limited, with shared common areas and a single bedroom for Aino.

Aino was present during the conversation and displayed a moderate level of engagement. She appeared well-groomed but showed signs of fatigue, possibly due to recent transitions between foster homes. During our discussion, she expressed feelings of isolation and difficulty adjusting to new environments. Aino mentioned missing her biological family and friends, which contributed to her emotional distress.

**Assessment**

Aino's case presents a moderate severity due to her ongoing need for stable housing and emotional support. The shared living arrangement in the foster home poses challenges in terms of privacy and personal space, potentially exacerbating her feelings of isolation. Her longing for her biological family indicates a need for family therapy or counseling to address these attachment issues.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. Arrange a referral to a local mental health professional specializing in adolescent therapy to address Aino's emotional needs and help her cope with feelings of isolation and longing for her biological family.
2. Coordinate with the foster care agency to explore alternative placements that may offer more independent living arrangements, considering Aino's need for privacy and personal space.
3. Schedule a follow-up visit in two weeks to assess progress and reevaluate Aino's needs, ensuring appropriate support services are in place.
4. Maintain open communication with the foster family to address any concerns or challenges they may encounter while supporting Aino.

This report will be shared with the relevant stakeholders, including the foster care agency, mental health professionals, and Aino's school counselor, to ensure a coordinated and comprehensive approach in addressing her needs.
