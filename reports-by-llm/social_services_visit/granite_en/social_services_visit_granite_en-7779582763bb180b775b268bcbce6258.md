---

**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted to evaluate the parental capacity of Aino Miettinen and her adult sibling, who are sharing a residence in Humppila, Finland. The critical case severity indicates a significant risk to the well-being of any potential children under their care. The purpose of this evaluation is to assess their ability to provide a safe, nurturing environment and meet the essential needs of a child.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at Aino Miettinen's residence, the living conditions were noted as poorly maintained and cluttered, with signs of pest infestation. The shared space between Aino and her sibling, Marko, was cramped and lacked basic amenities such as a dedicated kitchen area or separate sleeping quarters.

During our interaction, Aino appeared withdrawn and anxious, while Marko seemed defensive and agitated. Their communication was often strained, marked by frequent disagreements and tension. There were concerns regarding their mental health stability, as both displayed signs of emotional distress and impaired judgment.

**Assessment**

The current living situation poses immediate risks to anyone residing there, let alone a child. The household's inability to maintain even basic standards of cleanliness and safety suggests a lack of capacity to provide for a child's needs effectively. Both Aino and Marko demonstrated emotional instability during the visit, raising concerns about their ability to offer consistent care, support, and a stable environment for a child.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

Given the critical case severity, it is recommended that:

1. Immediate housing intervention is required to address the unsafe living conditions. The local social services should collaborate with housing authorities to secure temporary accommodation for Aino and Marko, prioritizing their safety and well-being.
   
2. Both siblings require urgent mental health assessments and support. Referrals should be made to psychological services specializing in trauma-informed care, given the evident emotional distress and potential history of adverse experiences.

3. Parenting capacity workshops or counseling sessions should be arranged to evaluate their suitability for parenting and to provide guidance on child development needs. This intervention should occur concurrently with mental health support to address underlying issues affecting their decision-making and emotional regulation.

4. A follow-up visit is scheduled in four weeks to reassess progress, ensure compliance with recommended actions, and determine if further interventions are necessary before considering a more comprehensive child protection plan.

This report underscores the urgency of addressing the immediate safety concerns within the household and the critical need for support services to stabilize Aino Miettinen and Marko's situation, thereby mitigating potential risks to any future children under their care.
