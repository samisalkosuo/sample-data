**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This homeless outreach visit was conducted in response to an urgent case report indicating that the Pitkäranta family, residing in Eckerö, Finland, had recently lost their home and were living temporarily with extended family members. The severity of their situation necessitated immediate assessment and intervention by social services.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at the temporary accommodation shared with Jari and Leena Pitkäranta's elderly parents, it was evident that space was severely constrained. The family of six occupies a two-room apartment, with the parents and older children sharing one room, while the youngest child sleeps in the living area on a makeshift bed.

Jari and Leena appeared exhausted but cooperative during our interaction. They expressed gratitude for any assistance that could alleviate their current strain. The children were quiet, displaying signs of fatigue, yet attempted to engage with us despite the challenging environment. Notably, the 15-year-old, Mikko, showed concern for his younger siblings and a desire to help find a more stable living situation.

**Assessment**

The Pitkärantas' immediate need is for secure housing. The current living conditions pose health risks due to overcrowding and lack of privacy, impacting the family's well-being, particularly affecting the younger children’s development and the parents' ability to provide adequate care. Emotional stress is evident, with Leena expressing anxiety about their future prospects and Mikko's protective nature indicating a mature understanding of family responsibilities beyond his years.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. **Immediate Housing Placement:** Collaborate with local housing authorities to secure temporary accommodation suitable for the family size, ensuring safety and privacy.
2. **Financial Assistance:** Connect the Pitkärantas with financial counseling services to address any underlying issues leading to their homelessness and provide short-term financial support to stabilize their situation.
3. **Child Protection Services:** Given Mikko's advanced emotional awareness, initiate a developmental assessment to ensure his well-being and offer age-appropriate support or counseling if necessary.
4. **Family Support Program:** Enroll the family in a comprehensive support program that includes parenting classes, employment assistance for Jari and Leena, and educational support for the children.
5. **Follow-up Visit:** Schedule a follow-up visit within one week to monitor progress, address any emerging needs, and adjust intervention strategies as required.

This urgent case demands swift action to prevent further deterioration of the family's living conditions and emotional health. Coordinated efforts with local housing authorities, financial advisors, child protection services, and employment support agencies are imperative for providing sustainable relief to the Pitkärantas.
