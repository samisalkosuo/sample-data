**Summary of Visit Purpose:**

This visit was conducted as part of the routine veteran support service check-in for Aino Korhonen, an elderly woman residing in Kurikka, Finland. The purpose was to assess her living conditions, emotional state, and overall well-being, given her early dementia symptoms.

**Observations During the Visit:**

Upon arrival, Aino was found in her modestly furnished living room, where she greeted me warmly. Her home appeared clean and organized, with no immediate safety hazards identified. Aino demonstrated some confusion regarding the date and time, which is consistent with her early dementia diagnosis. She expressed a desire to maintain her independence and was engaged in a simple puzzle, indicating mental stimulation.

Aino's emotional state seemed stable, with occasional moments of quiet reflection. Her daughter, Marja, was present during the visit and provided valuable insights into Aino's daily routine and any recent changes in behavior or health. Marja expressed concerns about her mother's increasing forgetfulness but also highlighted Aino's resilience and positive outlook.

**Assessment:**

Aino's case is currently classified as low severity due to her stable emotional state, manageable cognitive decline, and supportive family environment. However, there is a need for ongoing monitoring of her dementia progression and potential adjustments to her living conditions to accommodate her changing needs.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up:**

1. Schedule bi-monthly check-ins to monitor Aino's cognitive and physical health, ensuring any changes are addressed promptly.
2. Refer Aino to a local dementia support group to foster social engagement and provide additional resources for caregivers like Marja.
3. Arrange for a home safety assessment by an occupational therapist to identify any necessary modifications for Aino's continued independent living.
4. Encourage Marja to participate in respite care services to alleviate any potential caregiver stress and ensure her ability to provide ongoing support for her mother.

This report will be shared with the veteran support service team and relevant healthcare providers to facilitate coordinated care for Aino Korhonen. Further updates will be provided following the implementation of recommended actions.
