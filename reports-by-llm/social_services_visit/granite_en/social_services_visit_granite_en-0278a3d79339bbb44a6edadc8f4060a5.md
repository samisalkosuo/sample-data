---

**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted to assess the needs and circumstances of an unaccompanied minor, Aino Miettinen, a young pregnant woman residing in Pielavesi, Finland. The critical case severity indicates an urgent need for intervention due to potential risks associated with her pregnancy and lack of support.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at Aino's residence, a modest apartment shared with her partner, Iiro Koskinen, several notable observations were made:

1. **Living Conditions:** The apartment was clean but sparsely furnished, lacking essential baby items such as a crib or changing table. There was limited food in the pantry, and the couple appeared to struggle financially.
2. **Interactions:** Aino and Iiro displayed a supportive relationship, though Aino seemed anxious about her pregnancy and future responsibilities. Iiro, while caring, appeared overwhelmed by the prospect of parenthood without proper resources or guidance.
3. **Emotional State:** Aino expressed fear regarding her ability to provide for her unborn child, citing a lack of family support and limited employment opportunities due to her pregnancy. Iiro showed concern but seemed uncertain about how to best assist his partner.
4. **Notable Concerns:** The couple's financial instability, inadequate living conditions, and Aino's advanced stage of pregnancy without access to prenatal care raised significant concerns for the health and well-being of both mother and child.

**Assessment**

The assessment revealed a critical situation due to the following factors:

1. **Pregnancy Complications:** Aino is in her third trimester without regular prenatal care, increasing risks for both her and the baby.
2. **Financial Hardship:** The family's inability to afford basic necessities for an infant suggests potential neglect or inadequate care post-birth.
3. **Lack of Support Network:** Absence of extended family support heightens the risk of isolation and increases dependency on the young couple, who are themselves inexperienced in childcare.
4. **Housing Instability:** The current living conditions are insufficient for a newborn, potentially leading to unsafe environments for the child.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

Immediate intervention is crucial to mitigate identified risks:

1. **Medical Referral:** Arrange urgent prenatal care and ensure Aino receives comprehensive antenatal services to address any potential complications.
2. **Financial Assistance:** Connect the family with local welfare services for financial support, including food vouchers and possible housing assistance.
3. **Parenting Support:** Enroll the couple in parenting classes to equip them with essential skills for childcare and emotional readiness.
4. **Counseling Services:** Provide access to mental health counseling for both Aino and Iiro to address anxiety, build coping strategies, and strengthen their relationship dynamics.
5. **Follow-up Visits:** Schedule regular follow-ups every two weeks initially, then monthly post-delivery to monitor progress, provide ongoing support, and ensure the child's well-being.

This report underscores the urgency of addressing Aino Miettinen's situation comprehensively to prevent potential harm to both mother and child. Swift action in line with these recommendations is imperative to stabilize their circumstances and foster a nurturing environment for the upcoming birth.
