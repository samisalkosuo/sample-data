Upon arrival at the Khan residence, I was greeted by Aisha Khan, who appeared calm and composed. The home was clean and organized, with a warm and welcoming atmosphere. Mohammad Khan was present during the visit, engaged in play with their children, demonstrating active involvement in their upbringing.

The family's interactions were positive, with both parents using encouraging language and setting clear boundaries for their children.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

Given the low case severity and the family's proactive approach, no urgent interventions are required at this time. However, it is recommended that:

1. The Khans continue participating in parenting support groups to share experiences with other families and learn from diverse perspectives.
2. A follow-up visit be scheduled in three months to reassess their integration progress and parenting practices.
3. Connections be made with local community resources, such as cultural centers or language classes, to further support their adaptation to Veteli.
4. The family be encouraged to utilize the Finnish parenting helpline for any future concerns or questions, ensuring ongoing access to support.
