**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted as an urgent foster family evaluation due to the household's mental health challenges. The purpose was to assess the suitability and capability of Aino & Jussi Korhonen as potential foster parents, given their own ongoing mental health issues.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at the Korhonen residence, the home appeared tidy and well-maintained, suggesting a basic level of functionality despite the couple's mental health challenges. Aino and Jussi were cooperative and welcoming, though their emotional states seemed fluctuating throughout the visit. There were signs of stress, such as disorganized paperwork and occasional difficulty in following through on simple tasks.

During interactions with their potential foster child (not present), Aino and Jussi demonstrated a willingness to engage but exhibited inconsistent responses, sometimes appearing overwhelmed by the prospect of caring for a child with additional needs. Their living environment was safe, but there were concerns about their ability to provide consistent, structured care due to their own mental health struggles.

**Assessment**

Given the urgency of the case and the evident mental health challenges faced by Aino and Jussi Korhonen, it is clear that additional support is necessary before considering them suitable as foster parents. While they express a genuine desire to care for a child, their current circumstances pose significant risks, including potential emotional instability that could negatively impact a child's development and well-being.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. **Immediate Referral to Mental Health Services:** Aino and Jussi should be referred to intensive mental health support to stabilize their conditions. This includes regular therapy sessions and possibly medication management if appropriate.

2. **Case Management Support:** Engage a dedicated case manager to provide ongoing assessment, support, and guidance for the Korhonens as they work towards improving their mental health stability.

3. **Parenting Skills Training:** Once mental health stabilization is evident, consider enrolling Aino and Jussi in parenting skills programs tailored to families dealing with similar challenges. This would equip them with the necessary tools to manage the demands of foster care effectively.

4. **Follow-up Visits:** Schedule bi-monthly follow-up visits to monitor progress, reassess their suitability as foster parents, and adjust support plans accordingly. The next scheduled visit is set for 15.03.2025.

In conclusion, while Aino and Jussi Korhonen show potential and a desire to provide a loving home, the current mental health challenges necessitate a cautious approach. With appropriate interventions and consistent support, they may become suitable foster parents in the future. Until then, prioritizing their own well-being is crucial for any potential success in fostering.
