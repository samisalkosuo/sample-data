---

**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This post-hospital discharge visit was conducted to assess the well-being and support needs of Aino Koskinen's household, where she and her husband, Mikko, are caring for their two grandchildren, 8-year-old Eeva and 5-year-old Olli, following a recent hospital stay for one of the children. The visit aimed to ensure a smooth transition back home, address any concerns, and provide necessary resources to maintain the family's well-being.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at Aino and Mikko's cozy, modestly furnished home in Hailuoto, both grandparents appeared warm and welcoming. The living conditions were clean and organized, with age-appropriate toys and learning materials for the children. Eeva and Olli seemed healthy and engaged, playing quietly while their grandparents prepared a light snack.

Aino expressed gratitude for the support provided during her grandchild's hospital stay and shared that they were eager to ensure a comfortable recovery at home. Mikko mentioned that they had been managing well with daily tasks but acknowledged the emotional strain of caring for young children while also supporting each other through recent health challenges.

The children appeared happy and well-cared for, with no immediate signs of distress or behavioral issues. Aino reported that Eeva had been attending school regularly before the hospitalization and was catching up on missed work. Olli, who attends preschool, was also doing well, though Aino mentioned some difficulty adjusting to Eeva's prolonged absence.

**Assessment**

The Koskinen household demonstrates a strong, supportive environment for the grandchildren, with both grandparents actively involved in their care. The low case severity indicates that the family is generally stable and resourceful, although they may benefit from additional emotional and practical support during this period of adjustment. There are no apparent safety concerns or risks identified, but ongoing monitoring is recommended to address potential challenges as they arise.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. Connect the family with local parenting support groups or playgroups to foster social connections for both children and provide respite for the grandparents.
2. Arrange a follow-up visit in two weeks to assess progress, address any emerging needs, and offer ongoing support.
3. Provide information on community resources such as meal delivery services or transportation assistance if needed during this transition period.
4. Encourage Aino and Mikko to reach out to their local health clinic for any concerns related to the children's recovery or well-being.

This report will be shared with relevant service providers to ensure a coordinated response in supporting the Koskinen family during this time.
