---

**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted as part of a juvenile probation compliance check due to the high-severity case involving Aino Mäkelä, who is recovering from domestic abuse. The purpose was to assess the living conditions, family dynamics, and overall well-being of Ms. Mäkelä and her minor children, ensuring adherence to probation requirements and identifying any immediate needs or risks.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at Aino Mäkelä's residence, I was greeted by Ms. Mäkelä, who appeared visibly anxious but cooperative. The living conditions were adequate, with cleanliness maintained despite some signs of recent emotional distress. Her two minor children, 10-year-old Elias and 7-year-old Anna, were present and seemed to be in good health.

During our conversation, Ms. Mäkelä expressed ongoing fear related to her former partner, despite having obtained a restraining order. She mentioned feeling isolated due to limited social support networks and the challenges of managing her children's emotional needs amidst her own recovery process.

**Assessment**

The high case severity is primarily driven by the history of domestic abuse, Ms. Mäkelä's current anxiety, and the potential risk posed by her former partner. The family dynamics indicate a need for increased support to address both immediate safety concerns and long-term emotional well-being.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. **Immediate Safety Measures:** Coordinate with local law enforcement to ensure enhanced monitoring of the restraining order against Ms. Mäkelä's former partner, including regular check-ins.
   
2. **Mental Health Support:** Arrange for a referral to a trauma-informed therapist specializing in domestic abuse recovery for both Aino and her children. Schedule an initial session within the next two weeks.

3. **Parental Support Group:** Enroll Ms. Mäkelä in a parenting support group focused on healing from trauma, which can also provide her with a network of peers facing similar challenges.

4. **Regular Follow-up Visits:** Schedule bi-weekly visits over the next month to monitor progress, adjust interventions as necessary, and offer ongoing support.

5. **Community Resources:** Connect Ms. Mäkelä with local women's shelters or support groups in Ylitornio for additional community-based assistance.

This report will be updated following each follow-up visit to track the implementation of these recommendations and any emerging needs.
