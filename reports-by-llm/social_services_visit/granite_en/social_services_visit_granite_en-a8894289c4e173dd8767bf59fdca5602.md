---

**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This newborn and infant safety visit was conducted due to a critical case severity level, indicating potential immediate risk to the well-being of the infants in the care of their grandparents, Aino and Antti Korhonen. The primary objectives were to assess the living conditions, evaluate family dynamics, and identify any immediate hazards or concerns related to the infants' safety and development.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at the Korhonen residence in Ulvila, Finland, we observed a modest, cluttered home with signs of disorganization and potential tripping hazards from misplaced items. The living space appeared small for the three generations sharing itâ€”grandparents Aino (65) and Antti (70), their adult daughter's two children (ages 2 months and 18 months).

Aino, the grandmother, seemed overwhelmed and exhausted, displaying signs of stress. She appeared to be managing childcare duties while also assisting her daughter, who was recovering from a recent medical procedure. Antti, the grandfather, was present but less engaged, often retreating to another room.

The infants were in good health, with appropriate weight gain for their ages. However, there were notable concerns:

1. The 2-month-old infant's crib had loose, worn-out padding and was placed near a window without proper barriers, posing a fall risk.
2. Both infants shared a small play area with potentially hazardous small objects within their reach.
3. Aino mentioned feeding the younger infant formula mixed with water directly from the tap, disregarding safe preparation guidelines to save time.
4. There was no evidence of a designated napping space for either infant, leading to frequent improvised sleep arrangements on various surfaces around the house.

**Assessment**

The critical case severity is primarily driven by immediate safety concerns within the home environment and questionable care practices. The grandparents' limited understanding of safe infant handling and preparation techniques increases the risk of neglect or accidental harm to the infants. The small living space, combined with the grandparents' advanced age and health limitations, further compounds these risks.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. **Immediate Intervention:** Arrange for a pediatrician's home visit to address safe formula preparation and discuss general infant care practices.
2. **Home Safety Modification:** Collaborate with local community resources to secure necessary crib padding replacements and childproofing materials, focusing on window barriers and securing small objects.
3. **Respite Care Support:** Facilitate access to respite care services for Aino and Antti to provide them with much-needed breaks and ensure continuous, attentive care for the infants.
4. **Family Education:** Schedule regular family education sessions focusing on safe sleep practices, nutrition, developmental milestones, and stress management techniques for caregivers.
5. **Follow-up Visits:** Conduct follow-up visits within one week and then bi-weekly for the next month to monitor progress, provide ongoing support, and ensure adherence to safety recommendations.

This report underscores the urgency of addressing immediate safety concerns while fostering a supportive environment for Aino and Antti as they navigate their role in caring for their grandchildren.
