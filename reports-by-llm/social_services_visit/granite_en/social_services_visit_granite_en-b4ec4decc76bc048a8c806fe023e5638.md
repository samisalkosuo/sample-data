---

**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted as part of a routine child visitation supervision to assess the living conditions and care provided to Ms. Aino Mäkelä, an elderly woman exhibiting early symptoms of dementia. The purpose was to ensure that her needs are being met appropriately, especially in relation to any potential impact on her grandchild's visits.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at Ms. Mäkelä’s residence, I observed a clean and modestly furnished one-bedroom apartment. The environment appeared safe with no immediate hazards noted. Ms. Mäkelä was present but seemed disoriented, occasionally forgetting recent conversations. She displayed moments of lucidity, engaging in simple tasks like preparing tea. Her grandchild, a lively 8-year-old named Elias, visited during this time. While Elias appeared affectionate and attentive towards his grandmother, Ms. Mäkelä's confusion sometimes led to minor frustration for both parties.

**Assessment**

The assessment indicates a moderate case severity due to the early stage of dementia affecting daily functioning and interactions. Although Ms. Mäkelä’s home is safe, her cognitive decline poses challenges in managing routine activities independently. The occasional strain during visits with Elias suggests a need for support to maintain positive family relationships amidst the changing dynamics.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. **Cognitive Stimulation Therapy:** Referral to a local geriatric psychologist specializing in cognitive therapies to help manage symptoms and slow progression.
   
2. **Family Support Group:** Introduction to a support group for families dealing with early-stage dementia, facilitating shared experiences and coping strategies.

3. **Home Care Services:** Evaluation for potential part-time home care assistance to aid with daily chores, reducing stress on Ms. Mäkelä and ensuring her needs are met without overburdening Elias.

4. **Follow-up Visit:** Scheduled in four weeks to reassess progress, adjust interventions if necessary, and continue monitoring the impact of these services on family dynamics and Ms. Mäkelä’s condition.

This report aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current situation, recommendations for immediate support, and a timeline for follow-up to ensure Ms. Mäkelä's well-being and the health of her familial relationships are maintained effectively.
