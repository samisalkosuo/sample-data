Upon arrival at Jari's residence, the living conditions appeared tidy and organized, with evidence of ongoing efforts to maintain a comfortable home environment for his son. Jari was present and engaged during our discussion, demonstrating a clear commitment to his child’s upbringing.

Jari expressed gratitude for the support services provided thus far, particularly the parenting classes and financial assistance that have helped him manage single parenthood.

**Assessment**

The current support plan appears to be meeting the moderate needs of this household effectively. Jari's active participation in parenting classes and utilization of financial aid reflect positively on his ability to provide for his son’s basic needs. The family dynamics are stable, with a clear bond between father and child.

The primary risk identified is Jari's job-related stress, which, if prolonged or intensified, could impact his emotional availability and overall family stability. It is crucial to monitor this aspect closely to prevent potential escalation into a more severe case.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. **Job Support Referral:** Arrange a referral to employment services for Jari to explore options that might enhance his job security and reduce work-related stress. This could include vocational counseling, resume building assistance, or training programs relevant to his field.

2. **Mental Health Check-in:** Schedule a follow-up mental health assessment for Jari to ensure he has access to coping strategies for managing stress effectively. This can prevent stress from adversely affecting his parenting role.

3. **Continued Parenting Support:** Maintain regular contact with the parenting class facilitators to offer ongoing support and address any emerging questions or concerns Jari might have regarding child-rearing practices.

4. **Next Visit Timeline:** Plan a follow-up visit in three months to reassess progress, review any new developments, and adjust the support plan as necessary. 

By addressing these recommendations, we aim to fortify the family's resilience against potential future challenges while ensuring that Jari and his son continue to receive the necessary support for their well-being.
