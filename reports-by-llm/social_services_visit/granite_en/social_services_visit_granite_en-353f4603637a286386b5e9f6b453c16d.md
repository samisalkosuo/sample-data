**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted to assess the social reintegration needs of Aino Mäkelä, a multi-generational household facing moderate financial difficulties in Jyväskylä, Finland. The purpose was to evaluate their current living conditions, family dynamics, and identify potential risks or support requirements for successful reintegration into the community.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at Aino Mäkelä's residence, I was greeted by Aino (45), her spouse Pekka (50), their two children Anna (18) and Eero (12), and Aino's elderly mother, Maija (80). The family appeared to be cooperative and open during our conversation.

The living conditions were modest but clean. There was evidence of financial constraints, such as basic furnishings and limited personal belongings. The children's educational materials indicated they were engaged in their studies, while Maija seemed content with her daily routine. Aino expressed concern over the family's current financial situation, stating that she had recently lost her part-time job due to company downsizing.

Emotionally, the family appeared resilient and hopeful despite their challenges. Anna showed signs of maturity by discussing potential future employment opportunities, while Eero engaged in play, demonstrating normal childhood behavior. Pekka expressed a strong desire to find new employment and support his family.

**Assessment**

The Mäkelä household is experiencing moderate financial difficulties due to job loss, which has led to concerns about meeting basic needs and maintaining stability. The multi-generational living arrangement provides emotional support but also presents challenges in terms of space and privacy. There are no immediate safety risks identified; however, the family's vulnerability to further economic hardship requires attention.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. **Financial Assistance:** Connect the Mäkeläs with local financial counseling services to explore available benefits and support programs for unemployed individuals and families.
2. **Employment Support:** Refer Pekka to job training or placement services tailored to his skill set, considering current labor market demands in Jyväskylä.
3. **Educational Support:** Encourage Anna's continued pursuit of educational opportunities and explore scholarship or part-time work options to alleviate financial pressure.
4. **Childcare and Elderly Care Resources:** Assess the need for affordable childcare and elder care services, given Pekka’s potential increased working hours and Maija's age.
5. **Follow-up Visit:** Schedule a follow-up assessment in three months to review progress on employment, financial stability, and overall well-being of the family.

This report aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the Mäkelä household’s situation and guide targeted interventions to support their social reintegration into the Jyväskylä community successfully.
