---

**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This post-abuse recovery support visit was conducted to assess the wellbeing of Aino M채kel채 and her blended family following a recent custody change. The case is deemed critical due to the severe nature of the abuse allegations and the family's vulnerability during this transitional period.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival, Aino greeted me warmly but appeared anxious. Her children, 10-year-old Eemil and 7-year-old Leena, were present. Eemil seemed withdrawn, while Leena was visibly upset and clung to her mother. The living conditions were adequate, though the home felt tense and chaotic. Aino expressed concern about her ex-partner's potential retaliation and the children's adjustment to their new custody arrangement.

**Assessment**

The family is in a critical state due to recent abuse allegations and the ensuing custody changes. The children display signs of emotional distress, with Eemil exhibiting withdrawn behavior and Leena showing increased anxiety. Aino's fear of retaliation from her ex-partner poses an immediate risk to their safety. The family dynamics are strained, with Aino struggling to balance her role as a parent and protector.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. Immediate referral to a local counseling service specializing in child trauma for Eemil and Leena.
2. Arrange a meeting with a family therapist to address the children's emotional needs and support Aino in her parenting role.
3. Coordinate with law enforcement to ensure Aino's safety and implement measures against potential retaliation from her ex-partner.
4. Schedule a follow-up visit within one week to reassess the family's progress and adjust support services as needed.
5. Explore additional resources, such as parenting classes or support groups, to empower Aino in managing her children's recovery and her own wellbeing.
