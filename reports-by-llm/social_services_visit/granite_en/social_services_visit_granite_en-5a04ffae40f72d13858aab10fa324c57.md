---

**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted as a follow-up to the parenting education program. The purpose was to assess Aino Mäkelä's progress in applying the skills learned during the program, ensuring her newborn infant's well-being, and addressing any emerging concerns or needs.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at Ms. Mäkelä's residence, I was greeted by a clean and organized living space. The newborn, Leo, appeared healthy and content in his crib. Aino demonstrated a keen interest in learning more about infant development and responding to Leo's needs. She engaged with Leo attentively, implementing many of the parenting strategies learned from the program.

During our conversation, Aino expressed gratitude for the support received and shared her challenges in balancing household chores and caring for Leo. She mentioned feeling overwhelmed at times but was determined to improve her situation. Her emotional state appeared stable, with occasional signs of stress evident when discussing her daily routine.

**Assessment**

Aino Mäkelä is a dedicated mother who actively seeks to provide a nurturing environment for her newborn, Leo. She has shown progress in applying parenting education principles, such as responsive feeding and soothing techniques. However, the moderate case severity indicates that she requires ongoing support to manage daily stressors effectively.

Notable concerns include Aino's struggle with balancing household tasks and caring for Leo, which may impact her ability to consistently implement learned strategies. Additionally, there is a risk of potential emotional exhaustion if appropriate support mechanisms are not established.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. Continue providing parenting education resources and support groups to reinforce learned skills and offer peer networking opportunities.
2. Arrange for a home visit from a community health nurse to address practical concerns, such as household organization and self-care strategies for Aino.
3. Connect Aino with local parent-child playgroups to foster social connections and provide Leo with developmentally appropriate interactions.
4. Schedule a follow-up visit in four weeks to reassess progress, address any emerging concerns, and offer additional support as needed.

By implementing these recommendations, we aim to bolster Aino Mäkelä's confidence and competence in parenting while mitigating potential risks associated with her moderate case severity.
