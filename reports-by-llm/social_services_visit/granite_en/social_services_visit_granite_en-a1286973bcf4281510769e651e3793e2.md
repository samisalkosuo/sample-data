---

**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This post-hospital discharge visit was conducted to assess Mikko Korhonen's living conditions, emotional state, and overall well-being following his recent hospitalization due to a severe mental health episode. The purpose was to ensure a safe and supportive environment for his successful reintegration into the community.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival, Mikko appeared clean and well-groomed, indicating he has been maintaining personal hygiene. He greeted me warmly but seemed anxious, fidgeting and speaking rapidly at times. His apartment was tidy, with essential items within easy reach. There were no immediate safety hazards observed.

During our conversation, Mikko expressed relief about being home but also voiced concerns about managing his symptoms independently. He mentioned feeling overwhelmed by daily tasks and reported occasional suicidal ideation, which prompted his hospital admission.

**Assessment**

Mikko's moderate case severity is evident in his struggle to cope with daily living activities and persistent suicidal thoughts. While he has a supportive network, including a sister who checks in regularly, Mikko lacks consistent in-home assistance to manage his mental health condition effectively.

The primary risk identified is the potential for self-harm due to unaddressed psychological distress and insufficient coping mechanisms. Family dynamics appear supportive, but they are currently limited in their ability to provide hands-on care.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. Arrange for a home health aide to assist Mikko with daily tasks and provide companionship, reducing feelings of isolation and anxiety.
2. Schedule regular telehealth sessions with a psychiatrist specializing in his condition to monitor medication adherence and adjust treatment plans as necessary.
3. Connect Mikko with a local support group for individuals managing similar mental health challenges to foster peer connections and shared learning experiences.
4. Plan a follow-up visit within two weeks to reassess progress, address any emerging concerns, and reinforce the importance of adhering to the recommended interventions.

By implementing these actions, we aim to mitigate identified risks, enhance Mikko's quality of life, and facilitate his successful recovery from this acute mental health episode.
