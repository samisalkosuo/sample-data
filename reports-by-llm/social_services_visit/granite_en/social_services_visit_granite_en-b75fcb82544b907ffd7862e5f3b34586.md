---

**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted as part of a juvenile probation compliance check for Aino Miettinen and her partner, Olli Koskinen. The case context involves critical concerns regarding the couple's ability to provide a safe and stable environment for their unborn child, given Aino's history of non-compliance with previous court orders related to substance abuse and associated criminal activities.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at the modest apartment on Kauppakatu, it was immediately apparent that the living conditions were substandard for a family expecting their first child. The environment was cluttered with signs of recent drug use, including paraphernalia visible in plain sight. Aino appeared disheveled and exhibited signs of fatigue, possibly due to pregnancy-related discomforts compounded by substance use. Olli, while present, seemed withdrawn and showed little engagement with the situation or his partner's condition.

During our conversation, Aino admitted to recent lapses in her court-mandated drug treatment program, citing stress related to her pregnancy and financial difficulties. She expressed a vague understanding of the risks her substance use posed to her unborn child but demonstrated limited insight into the severity of her situation or the necessity for strict adherence to rehabilitation programs.

**Assessment**

The assessment reveals a critical case with significant risk factors for both Aino and her unborn child. The current living conditions, coupled with Aino's relapse into substance use, indicate an immediate threat to the well-being of the family, particularly the fetus. Olli’s passive demeanor suggests either complicity or a lack of awareness regarding the gravity of their circumstances, which is concerning given his role as a potential support system for Aino and their child.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. **Immediate Referral to Intensive Substance Abuse Treatment:** Aino requires urgent enrollment in an intensive treatment program with strict supervision to address her relapse and mitigate risks to the fetus. This should include regular drug testing, counseling sessions, and parenting education components.

2. **Parenting Support Services:** Engage a specialized parenting support service to assist Aino and Olli in understanding their responsibilities as parents, focusing on creating a safe and nurturing environment for the child post-birth.

3. **Financial and Housing Assistance:** Coordinate with local social welfare services to provide financial aid and explore temporary or long-term housing solutions that meet health and safety standards, ensuring a stable foundation for the family.

4. **Regular Follow-up Visits:** Schedule bi-weekly visits to monitor compliance with treatment plans, assess changes in living conditions, and evaluate Aino’s progress in addressing her substance abuse issues. These visits should also include joint sessions with Olli to encourage his active participation in the family's rehabilitation process.

5. **Legal Intervention:** Consider petitioning the court for a review of current probation terms, possibly including stricter conditions or interventions to ensure Aino’s compliance and protect the child’s welfare.

This critical case demands swift and comprehensive action to safeguard the health and future of both mother and child. Immediate engagement with recommended services is imperative to mitigate identified risks and support the family in establishing a stable, nurturing environment.
