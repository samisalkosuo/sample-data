**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted as part of an unaccompanied minor intake assessment for Aisha Khan, a young girl who has recently relocated to Suomussalmi with her immigrant family. The purpose was to evaluate the living conditions, family dynamics, and overall well-being of Aisha in light of her moderate case severity.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at Kuutamo 12, Suomussalmi, I was greeted by Ms. Aisha Khan's mother, Sofia Khan. The family resides in a modest two-bedroom apartment that appears clean and well-maintained. Aisha, aged 14, was present during the visit and appeared to be in good health. She communicated fluently in English, indicating her acculturation into Western educational systems.

During our conversation, Sofia expressed gratitude for the support services available but also conveyed concerns about Aisha's integration into the local school system and her emotional adjustment post-relocation. Aisha seemed reserved initially but warmed up when discussing her interest in art and music, revealing a vibrant personality beneath her initial shyness.

**Assessment**

The family's living conditions are satisfactory, with no immediate safety hazards identified. However, the moderate case severity suggests underlying needs that require attention. Aisha's emotional state appears stable, yet there is a risk of social isolation given her recent move and the challenges associated with adapting to a new cultural environment.

Family dynamics seem supportive, with Sofia demonstrating a clear commitment to her daughter's well-being. Nonetheless, the lack of a broader support network in Suomussalmi could exacerbate feelings of isolation for Aisha, particularly as an unaccompanied minor.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. **Educational Support:** Arrange an introductory meeting with the local school counselor to facilitate Aisha's integration into her new educational environment. This should include exploring extracurricular activities, particularly in art and music, to foster a sense of belonging.

2. **Language and Cultural Integration:** Recommend participation in Finnish-as-a-Second-Language (FIS) classes to enhance Aisha's linguistic skills and cultural understanding.

3. **Community Engagement:** Connect the family with local community centers or immigrant support groups to encourage social interaction and reduce the risk of isolation.

4. **Follow-up Visit:** Schedule a follow-up visit in three months to reassess Aisha's progress, address any emerging concerns, and adjust support strategies as necessary.

This report underscores the importance of proactive intervention to mitigate potential risks associated with Aisha's recent relocation. By addressing her educational, linguistic, and social needs, we aim to ensure her successful integration into Finnish society.
