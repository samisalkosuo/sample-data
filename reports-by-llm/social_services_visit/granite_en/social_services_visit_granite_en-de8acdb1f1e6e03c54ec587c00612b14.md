**Social Services Visit Report**

*Client Name:* Aino M채kel채
*Address:* Kauppakatu 12, 37400 Joutsa, Finland

**Summary of Visit Purpose:**
This visit was conducted on 07.04.2025 in response to a high-severity case of household financial hardship and school attendance issues affecting a teenager residing at the above address. The purpose was to assess the family's current situation, identify potential risks, and determine appropriate support services.

**Observations During the Visit:**
Upon arrival, I was greeted by Aino M채kel채, the single parent of 15-year-old teenager, Eemil. The living conditions were modest but clean, with basic necessities provided. Eemil appeared withdrawn and showed signs of emotional distress during our conversation. He mentioned feeling overwhelmed by his academic responsibilities amidst the family's financial constraints.

Aino expressed her concerns about managing household expenses, particularly school-related costs for Eemil, including textbooks and transportation. She works part-time but struggles to make ends meet, often relying on food banks to feed her son. The strain of their situation is evident in Aino's anxious demeanor and frequent apologies for the family's circumstances.

**Assessment:**
The case severity is high due to the combination of financial hardship and its impact on Eemil's educational attendance. The family's limited resources exacerbate stress, potentially affecting Eemil's emotional well-being and academic performance. There are concerns about potential long-term consequences, including social isolation and reduced future opportunities for Eemil.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up:**
1. Immediate referral to local food banks and community support services to alleviate immediate financial pressures related to nutrition.
2. Collaboration with the school to explore options such as financial assistance for educational materials, transportation subsidies, or tutoring programs to improve Eemil's academic engagement.
3. Arrange a follow-up visit within two weeks to assess progress and adjust support strategies as needed.
4. Initiate a referral to a local mental health service provider for Eemil to address emotional distress and provide coping mechanisms.
5. Explore long-term financial counseling options for Aino to enhance her capacity to manage household finances effectively.

This report outlines the urgent need for intervention to stabilize the family's situation, mitigate risks to Eemil's well-being and education, and empower Aino with resources to navigate their current challenges more effectively.
