---

**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This urgent newborn and infant safety visit was conducted due to concerns about the well-being of two infants, aged three months and six months, being cared for by their maternal grandparents, Aino and Oskari Korhonen, in Pyhäntä, Finland. The referral highlighted potential neglect and inadequate living conditions, necessitating immediate intervention.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at the Korhonen residence, we observed a modest, cluttered home with signs of disorganization. The infants' bedroom was small, lacking proper ventilation and containing an overwhelming number of stuffed animals, posing a suffocation risk. Both infants appeared underweight for their age, with the younger displaying signs of lethargy and poor feeding habits.

Aino and Oskari Korhonen appeared overwhelmed and exhausted, struggling to manage basic care tasks such as feeding and diaper changes. Their emotional state was subdued, with Aino expressing feelings of helplessness and frustration regarding her inability to meet the infants' needs. Oskari, visibly distressed, mentioned their daughter's sudden departure without prior notice or support.

**Assessment**

The assessment reveals an urgent situation due to the grandparents' inability to provide adequate care for the infants, exacerbated by poor living conditions and lack of essential baby supplies. The infants' underweight condition and signs of neglect indicate potential malnutrition and inadequate stimulation. The family dynamics suggest that the parents are absent, leaving the grandparents to cope without proper resources or support.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. Immediate referral to a pediatrician for comprehensive health assessments of both infants, focusing on nutritional status and developmental milestones.
2. Arrangement of home safety checks to address hazards such as excessive stuffed animals in the nursery and general clutter throughout the residence.
3. Connection with local parenting support groups and respite care services to alleviate the grandparents' burden and provide them with essential guidance on infant care.
4. Establish a case management plan involving regular follow-up visits to monitor progress, ensure adherence to recommended interventions, and reassess the family's needs.
5. Explore options for family reunification or alternative long-term care arrangements, depending on the parents' return and their ability to provide a safe environment for their children.

This urgent intervention aims to protect the infants' well-being while supporting the grandparents in fulfilling their caregiving responsibilities. Further action is required promptly to address the identified risks and ensure the safety and development of these vulnerable children.
