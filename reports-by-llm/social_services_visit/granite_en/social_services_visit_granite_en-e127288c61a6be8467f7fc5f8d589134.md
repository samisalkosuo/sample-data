**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This homeless outreach visit was conducted in response to an urgent case report concerning Jari Pitkäranta, a disabled adult residing in Kemiönsaari, Finland. The visit aimed to assess the living conditions, evaluate the immediate needs of the household, and establish a plan for providing necessary support services.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at Jari's modest apartment on Kauppakatu, I was greeted by both Jari and his live-in caregiver, Anna Koskinen. Jari, a 45-year-old with mobility impairments due to a spinal cord injury, appeared visibly anxious and in distress. His living conditions were substandard; the apartment was cluttered, lacking basic furniture, and had signs of mold growth on walls and ceiling. Anna, who has been caring for Jari since his injury two years ago, seemed exhausted and overwhelmed by the situation.

During our conversation, Jari expressed a deep sense of isolation and despair, mentioning that he had recently lost his disability benefits due to administrative errors. Anna revealed that they were on the verge of homelessness as they could no longer afford rent following the loss of income.

**Assessment**

The assessment indicates an urgent situation with significant risks to Jari's health and well-being, exacerbated by the lack of adequate support services. The substandard living conditions pose immediate threats such as potential respiratory issues due to mold exposure and increased risk of falls due to cluttered spaces. Furthermore, the loss of disability benefits has created a financial crisis for the household, pushing them towards imminent homelessness.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. **Immediate Relief:** Arrange emergency housing through local shelters or transitional housing programs to ensure Jari and Anna have safe temporary accommodation while longer-term solutions are being developed.
   
2. **Financial Assistance:** Facilitate an application for emergency financial aid to cover rent arrears and essential living expenses, with a focus on preventing further disruption of disability benefits.

3. **Healthcare Support:** Coordinate with local health services to address Jari's physical health concerns, including arranging a mold inspection and remediation in the current residence if possible or securing alternative accommodation that meets health standards.

4. **Caregiver Relief:** Provide Anna with respite care services to alleviate her exhaustion and ensure she can continue providing essential care for Jari without compromising her own well-being.

5. **Long-term Housing Solution:** Initiate a search for permanent, accessible housing that meets Jari's disability needs, involving collaboration with housing authorities and non-profit organizations specializing in affordable, adapted housing for individuals with disabilities.

6. **Follow-up Visit:** Schedule a follow-up visit within one week to monitor progress on the above actions and reassess Jari's and Anna's situation.

This report underscores the critical need for swift intervention to prevent further deterioration of Jari Pitkäranta’s living conditions and overall well-being. Immediate action is required to mitigate identified risks and ensure the household's stability and safety.
