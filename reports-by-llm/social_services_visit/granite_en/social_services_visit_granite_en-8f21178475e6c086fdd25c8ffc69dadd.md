**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at Aino Mäkelä's residence in Hailuoto, Finland, the living conditions appeared adequate but showed signs of recent upheaval, likely due to the custody transition. The children, aged 8 and 10, were present and engaged with their mother during our observation. Aino demonstrated a caring demeanor, ensuring the children's basic needs were met, including providing nutritious meals and maintaining cleanliness.

Interactions between Aino and her children were generally positive, marked by affectionate exchanges and attempts at open communication. However, there were noticeable tensions, particularly when discussing the custody arrangements with the children's father. Aino's emotional state fluctuated, displaying moments of calm and others of visible stress and anxiety.

**Assessment**

Aino Mäkelä exhibits a fundamental love and concern for her children, evident in her daily care routines. However, the recent custody changes have introduced significant stress, impacting her ability to remain consistently calm and composed, which is crucial for effective parenting, especially during sensitive discussions involving the children.

The family dynamics suggest potential risks related to the children's emotional well-being due to ongoing parental conflict. The urgency of this case necessitates immediate intervention to mitigate these risks and support Aino in managing her stress effectively.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

This will provide Aino with tools to manage her stress and improve communication strategies with the children's father, reducing conflict exposure for the kids.

2. **Parenting Support Group:** Enrollment in a local parenting support group tailored for blended families. This will offer Aino peer support and practical advice on navigating the complexities of her family structure.

3. **Follow-up Visit:** Schedule a follow-up visit within four weeks to reassess progress, evaluate the effectiveness of the recommended interventions, and adjust support strategies as necessary.

4. **Child Welfare Check:** Coordinate with school authorities for regular child welfare checks to monitor the children's emotional and behavioral health in response to the family dynamics at home.

This report underscores the urgent need for targeted support to ensure Aino Mäkelä can provide a stable, nurturing environment for her children amidst these challenging transitions.
