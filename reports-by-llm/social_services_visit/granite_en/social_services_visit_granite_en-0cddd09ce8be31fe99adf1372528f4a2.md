---

**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This post-hospital discharge visit was conducted to assess the well-being of Aino Korhonen following her recent hospitalization for exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The visit aimed to evaluate the family's ability to manage Aino's ongoing health needs, ensure appropriate support is in place, and address any potential risks or concerns arising from her moderate case severity.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival, Aino appeared fatigued but cooperative. Her husband, Markku, was present and demonstrated concern for her well-being. The children, Anna (7) and Eero (9), were engaged in quiet activities, indicating they understood the need for a calm environment.

The living conditions were generally clean and organized, with necessary medical equipment, such as a nebulizer and oxygen concentrator, readily available. However, there was some clutter that could potentially hinder mobility for Aino, who uses a walker due to her respiratory limitations.

Aino expressed emotional distress related to her recent hospital stay and anxiety about managing her condition at home. Markku acknowledged the challenges but seemed committed to supporting his wife's recovery. The couple reported occasional disagreements regarding Aino's care, which occasionally escalated into verbal conflicts.

**Assessment**

The family dynamics present moderate risks, primarily stemming from Aino's health condition and the strain it places on the marital relationship. While Markku demonstrates a willingness to assist, the couple's communication difficulties could exacerbate stress levels, potentially impacting Aino's recovery and the children's well-being.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. **Couples Counseling:** Refer the family to a local couples therapy program to improve communication skills and manage marital stress effectively. This intervention aims to reduce conflict and enhance mutual support for Aino's ongoing health management.

2. **Respite Care:** Arrange for periodic respite care services to provide Markku with temporary relief, allowing him to address personal needs and preventing caregiver burnout.

3. **Home Modification:** Coordinate with a local occupational therapist to assess the home environment for necessary modifications that would improve Aino's mobility and safety.

4. **Medical Follow-up:** Schedule a follow-up appointment with Aino's pulmonologist within two weeks to review her treatment plan, address any emerging concerns, and ensure adherence to medication and therapy regimens.

5. **Support Group Referral:** Encourage Aino's participation in a local COPD support group to foster connections with others facing similar challenges, providing emotional support and practical advice.

**Next Visit Schedule:** Follow-up visit in four weeks to reassess progress, address any emerging needs, and reinforce support strategies.
