They demonstrated a good understanding of basic childcare practices, such as safe sleeping arrangements and feeding techniques.

Aino mentioned attending a local prenatal yoga class to manage stress, while Jussi spoke of his involvement in baby care workshops.

**Assessment**

Aino and Jussi show a moderate level of preparedness for parenthood, evident through their active participation in parenting education and proactive steps taken to ready their home. They exhibit a supportive relationship, with clear communication about responsibilities and expectations.

The primary risks identified are the lack of robust social support networks and Jussi's financial concerns. These factors could potentially increase stress levels post-delivery, impacting their ability to cope effectively as new parents.

Family dynamics appear healthy, with both partners actively involved in preparations. However, addressing the identified concerns is crucial to mitigate potential future challenges.
