**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This follow-up visit was conducted to assess the ongoing needs and living conditions of Mikko Korhonen, a single adult residing in Kaavi, Finland, who has an intellectual disability. The purpose was to evaluate the effectiveness of current support services and identify any emerging concerns or requirements, given the moderate severity of his case.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at Mikko's apartment, I found him engaged in a routine of daily activities, demonstrating a moderate level of independence. The living environment was clean and organized, with necessary assistive devices readily available. Mikko greeted me warmly, displaying a generally positive emotional state. However, there were instances where he appeared confused during conversations, indicating potential cognitive challenges.

During our interaction, Mikko expressed satisfaction with his current support services but mentioned occasional difficulties in understanding complex instructions from caregivers. He also shared concerns about social isolation, as he has limited interaction with neighbors and rarely attends community events due to transportation barriers.

**Assessment**

Mikko's living conditions are satisfactory, with adequate resources for managing his daily needs. His intellectual disability presents moderate challenges in comprehension and decision-making, which may increase the risk of misunderstandings or safety concerns if not properly addressed. The reported social isolation is a notable concern that could exacerbate emotional well-being and hinder cognitive stimulation.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. **Cognitive Support:** Arrange for regular cognitive assessments to tailor support strategies addressing Mikko's comprehension difficulties. Consider incorporating visual aids or simplified communication methods in his care plan.
   
2. **Social Integration:** Facilitate Mikko's participation in community activities by coordinating transportation services or group outings. Explore opportunities for peer support groups tailored to individuals with intellectual disabilities.

3. **Caregiver Training:** Provide additional training for current caregivers on effective communication strategies for individuals with intellectual disabilities, emphasizing patience and clarity.

4. **Follow-up Visit:** Schedule a subsequent visit in three months to reassess Mikko's progress, evaluate the effectiveness of implemented interventions, and address any emerging needs or concerns.

This report encapsulates the findings from the follow-up elderly care visit to Mr. Mikko Korhonen in Kaavi, Finland. The recommended actions aim to enhance his quality of life by addressing cognitive support, social integration, and caregiver effectiveness, all crucial elements in managing a moderate severity case of intellectual disability among elderly individuals.
