---

**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This post-hospital discharge visit was conducted to assess the well-being of Aino Korhonen following her recent hospitalization for exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The visit aimed to evaluate the family's ability to manage Aino's health needs, ensure appropriate support for her recovery, and address any potential risks or concerns arising from their separated status and shared custody arrangement.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival, Aino appeared fatigued but cooperative. Her husband, Markku, was present and demonstrated a supportive demeanor. The children, Anna (8) and Oskari (12), were well-groomed and engaged in quiet activities.

The living conditions were moderately clean, with some signs of disorganization typical of a household adjusting to recent changes. Aino's designated bedroom was comfortable, equipped with necessary medical equipment such as a nebulizer and oxygen concentrator. Markku reported adherence to Aino's medication schedule and assistance with daily activities.

Emotionally, Aino expressed gratitude for the support but also conveyed feelings of isolation due to her health condition and separation from Markku. Markku acknowledged his role in facilitating Aino's medical appointments and managing household tasks during her recovery. The children appeared content and well-cared for, with no immediate behavioral concerns noted.

**Assessment**

The family demonstrates a moderate case severity due to Aino's recent hospitalization and ongoing health management needs. While Markku is actively involved in supporting Aino's recovery, the separation may pose challenges in ensuring consistent care and emotional support. The children seem resilient but require monitoring for potential long-term impacts of their parents' separation.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. **Medical Follow-up:** Schedule a follow-up appointment with Aino's pulmonologist to monitor her COPD management and adjust treatment as necessary.
2. **Mental Health Support:** Refer Aino for counseling services to address feelings of isolation and facilitate coping strategies.
3. **Parental Coordination:** Encourage Markku and Aino to participate in parental coordination sessions to establish clear communication channels regarding the children's needs and support during this transitional period.
4. **Community Resources:** Connect the family with local support groups for individuals managing chronic illnesses and separated parents.
5. **Next Visit:** Schedule a follow-up visit in four weeks to reassess Aino's health status, evaluate the effectiveness of implemented supports, and address any emerging concerns.
