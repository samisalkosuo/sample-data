---

**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted as part of an ongoing immigration case monitoring process for a cohabiting couple, Aino Korhonen and her partner, who have been experiencing mental health challenges. The purpose was to assess their current living conditions, emotional well-being, and family dynamics in light of the moderate severity of their case.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at the designated address, I was greeted by Aino Korhonen, who appeared anxious but cooperative. Her partner, Markus Rantanen, was present and showed signs of depression, maintaining minimal verbal interaction during the visit. Their shared living space was clean and organized, with basic necessities provided. However, there were concerns regarding limited social engagement and potential isolation.

Aino expressed feelings of overwhelm due to her role as primary caregiver for Markus, who has been diagnosed with depression and requires consistent support. Both individuals acknowledged the strain on their relationship caused by these mental health challenges.

**Assessment**

The assessment indicates a moderate case severity, primarily driven by the couple's mental health issues and the resulting impact on their daily functioning and relationship dynamics. While Aino demonstrates resilience in managing household responsibilities, her emotional state suggests the need for additional support to prevent burnout. Markus' depression requires ongoing management to ensure he receives appropriate treatment and care.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. **Mental Health Support:** Arrange a referral to a local mental health professional specializing in couples therapy to address relationship dynamics and provide individual support for both Aino and Markus.

2. **Community Engagement:** Encourage participation in community activities or support groups designed for individuals facing similar challenges, fostering social connections and reducing isolation.

3. **Case Management:** Schedule a follow-up visit within four weeks to reassess progress, address any emerging concerns, and adjust support strategies as necessary.

4. **Immigration Case Monitoring:** Continue monitoring the immigration case aspects, ensuring that any legal or bureaucratic hurdles do not exacerbate their mental health situation.

This report serves to document the current status of Aino Korhonen and Markus Rantanen's household, highlighting areas of concern and outlining recommended actions to mitigate risks and enhance their well-being within the context of their immigration case.
