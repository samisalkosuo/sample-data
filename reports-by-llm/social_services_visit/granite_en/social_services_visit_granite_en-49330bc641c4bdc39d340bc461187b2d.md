**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This follow-up visit was conducted to assess the progress and wellbeing of a refugee family recently relocated to temporary accommodation in Viitasaari, Finland. The urgent case severity indicates a need for immediate attention due to potential risks and vulnerabilities associated with their recent domestic relocation.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at the Temporary Accommodation Centre, I was greeted by Aisha Khan, the mother of the family, along with her husband and three children aged 7, 5, and 2. The family appeared visibly anxious but cooperative during our interaction.

The living conditions were basic yet clean, with separate rooms for sleeping, cooking, and storage. There was adequate furniture, though limited personal belongings suggested recent arrival. The children seemed engaged in play, displaying signs of normalcy despite the circumstances. Aisha expressed gratitude for the temporary housing but conveyed concerns about language barriers, lack of employment opportunities, and integration into Finnish society.

**Assessment**

The family's urgent case severity stems from several factors:
1. Language barrier impacting daily needs and access to essential services.
2. Uncertainty regarding long-term housing solutions post-temporary accommodation.
3. Limited employment prospects, leading to potential financial strain and increased vulnerability.
4. The children's integration into the Finnish education system remains unresolved, posing risks to their development and future prospects.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. **Language Support:** Arrange immediate access to Finnish language classes for Aisha and her spouse to facilitate better communication and engagement with local services.
2. **Employment Assistance:** Connect the family with employment support programs tailored for refugees, including job training and placement services.
3. **Housing Consultation:** Collaborate with housing authorities to explore long-term housing options, ensuring stability beyond temporary accommodation.
4. **Education Enrollment:** Facilitate enrollment of the children in nearby schools, providing necessary support for a smooth transition into the Finnish education system.
5. **Psychosocial Support:** Schedule regular check-ins with a culturally sensitive counselor to address any emerging mental health concerns and promote family resilience.
6. **Next Visit:** Plan a follow-up within two weeks to review progress on these recommendations and adjust support strategies as needed.

This report underscores the immediate need for targeted interventions to mitigate risks and foster stability for this refugee family in their new environment.
