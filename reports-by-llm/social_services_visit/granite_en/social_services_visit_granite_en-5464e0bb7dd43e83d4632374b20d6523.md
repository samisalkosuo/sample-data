**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted to review the financial hardship of the Pitkäranta family, a married couple with four children, residing in Hankasalmi, Finland. The purpose was to assess their current living conditions and identify any potential support needs, given the reported low severity of their situation.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at the Pitkäranta household, I was greeted by both parents, Jari and Leena, who appeared well-groomed and in good health. The family resides in a modest, clean, and organized two-story home. The children, aged 10, 8, 6, and 3, were present and engaged in their respective activities, displaying typical energy levels for their ages.

Jari, the primary breadwinner, works part-time at a local sawmill, while Leena manages household tasks and cares for the youngest child. Both parents expressed gratitude for the support services already in place, such as subsidized childcare and food assistance programs. They reported no immediate concerns regarding housing stability or utility access.

**Assessment**

The Pitkäranta family's situation reflects low-severity financial hardship, primarily due to Jari's part-time employment and the associated lower income. Despite these challenges, the family demonstrates resourcefulness in managing their resources and maintaining a stable living environment for their children. The parents' commitment to their children's well-being is evident through their active involvement in their upbringing and utilization of available support services.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. Continue monitoring the family's situation every three months to assess any changes in employment status, income, or additional support needs.
2. Encourage Jari to explore opportunities for increased working hours or alternative part-time positions that may offer better compensation.
3. Connect the Pitkärantas with local financial literacy workshops and budgeting resources to enhance their ability to manage finances effectively.
4. Maintain open communication channels for any urgent needs or concerns that may arise between scheduled visits.

This report provides a comprehensive overview of the Pitkäranta family's current situation, highlighting their resilience in the face of financial hardship. By implementing the recommended actions, we aim to empower the family further and support their journey towards improved financial stability.
