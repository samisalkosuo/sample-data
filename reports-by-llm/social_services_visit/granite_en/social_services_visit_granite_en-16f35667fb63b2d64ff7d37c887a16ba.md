**Summary of Visit Purpose:**
This visit was conducted as part of an immigration case monitoring process due to the urgent nature of a family's history of chronic domestic violence. The purpose was to assess the current living conditions, evaluate the family dynamics, and identify immediate risks or needs for support services.

**Observations During the Visit:**
Upon arrival at Aino Virtanen's residence in Maarianhamina, I observed a tense atmosphere. Aino, her partner Jussi, and their two children, 8-year-old Elias and 5-year-old Olivia, were present. Aino appeared anxious and hesitant to engage in conversation, while Jussi maintained a domineering demeanor. The children displayed signs of fear and avoidance, keeping close to their mother.

The living conditions were substandard, with visible signs of neglect, such as peeling paint on walls, broken furniture, and a lack of essential household items. There was an overwhelming sense of unease permeating the environment. Aino disclosed that Jussi's verbal and emotional abuse had escalated in recent weeks, causing her to seek immigration status independently for herself and the children.

**Assessment:**
The family's situation is critically urgent due to the ongoing domestic violence and the immediate need for safety. The chronic nature of the abuse, coupled with the children's exposure to this environment, poses significant risks to their emotional well-being and development. Aino's decision to seek immigration status independently indicates a heightened risk and a need for swift intervention.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up:**
1. Immediate referral to the local domestic violence support service for an emergency safety plan, including temporary shelter if necessary.
2. Coordination with immigration authorities to expedite Aino's application for protection, ensuring her and the children's legal status is addressed promptly.
3. Arrange a follow-up visit within one week to assess the implementation of the safety plan and progress on the immigration case.
4. Engage child protective services to evaluate the children's needs and provide appropriate counseling or therapy.
5. Connect Aino with local resources for financial assistance, job training, and language classes to support her transition and independence.

This report underscores the critical need for rapid and comprehensive intervention to ensure the safety and well-being of Aino Virtanen and her children in Maarianhamina, Finland.
