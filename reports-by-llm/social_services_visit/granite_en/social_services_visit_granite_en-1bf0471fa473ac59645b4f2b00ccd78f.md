**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted as an unaccompanied minor intake assessment for Aiko Koskinen, a 14-year-old girl residing in transitional housing following her rehabilitation. The purpose was to evaluate her current living conditions, emotional state, and family dynamics to determine the appropriate level of support required.

**Observations During the Visit**

Aiko appeared clean and well-groomed during our interaction. She engaged actively in conversation, demonstrating a moderate level of curiosity about the assessment process. The transitional housing facility was maintained reasonably, with shared living spaces and private bedrooms for residents. There were no immediate safety hazards observed.

Aiko expressed some anxiety regarding her recent separation from her biological family and adjustment to a new environment. She mentioned feeling isolated at times but appreciated the structure and support provided by the transitional housing program. Her emotional state seemed stable, with occasional signs of sadness when discussing family matters.

**Assessment**

Aiko's case presents moderate severity due to her recent transition from rehabilitation into a new living arrangement without direct familial support. While she appears to be adapting reasonably well within the structured environment of transitional housing, concerns remain about her emotional well-being and potential feelings of isolation. There is no immediate evidence of neglect or abuse; however, ongoing monitoring is necessary to ensure her psychological needs are met.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. **Counseling Referral:** Arrange for Aiko to begin individual counseling sessions with a mental health professional experienced in supporting unaccompanied minors, focusing on coping strategies and family adjustment issues.

2. **Peer Support Group:** Enroll Aiko in a peer support group designed for young people in similar transitional phases to foster social connections and reduce feelings of isolation.

3. **Regular Check-ins:** Schedule bi-monthly follow-up visits to monitor her progress, emotional state, and any emerging needs within the next three months.

4. **Educational Liaison:** Collaborate with local educational authorities to ensure Aiko's enrollment in age-appropriate educational programs, addressing any gaps in schooling resulting from her recent rehabilitation period.

5. **Family Contact Facilitation:** Initiate discussions with Aikoâ€™s family (with her consent) to establish a safe and gradual process for maintaining contact, respecting all parties' boundaries and emotional readiness.

This report serves as an initial evaluation of Aiko Koskinen's situation. Continued vigilance and tailored support are crucial to ensure her successful integration into her new living environment and overall well-being.
