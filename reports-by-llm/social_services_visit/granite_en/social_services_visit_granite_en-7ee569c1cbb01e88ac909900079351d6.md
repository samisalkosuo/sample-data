---

**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted to assess the risk of domestic violence within the Korhonen household in Mikkeli, Finland. The case context involves allegations of neglect by both parents towards their two children. The low severity rating indicates that while concerns exist, there is no immediate danger or acute risk present.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at the Korhonen residence, I observed a modest apartment with basic living conditions. Both parents, Anna (mother) and Jussi (father), were present during the visit. They appeared cooperative and engaged in conversation, albeit with noticeable tension. The children, Linda (7) and Mikko (10), were well-groomed but seemed withdrawn, spending most of the time in their room.

Anna expressed remorse for the neglect, attributing it to her struggle with depression following a recent job loss. Jussi acknowledged his role in the situation, stating he was unaware of the extent of the children's needs due to his long working hours. There were no signs of physical altercations or immediate threats during the visit.

**Assessment**

The family dynamics suggest a low-risk environment for domestic violence at this time. The parents' willingness to engage and acknowledge their shortcomings is a positive indicator. However, Anna's depression and subsequent neglect require immediate attention to prevent escalation into more severe issues. The children's emotional withdrawal points to the need for intervention to address their well-being.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. **Mental Health Support:** Arrange a referral to a local mental health professional for Anna to manage her depression effectively and prevent future neglect.

2. **Parenting Skills Workshop:** Enroll the parents in a parenting skills workshop focused on child development and effective communication strategies.

3. **Regular Check-ins:** Schedule bi-weekly home visits over the next eight weeks to monitor progress, provide support, and ensure the children's needs are being met.

4. **Child Welfare Consultation:** Coordinate with child welfare services for a comprehensive assessment of the children's emotional state and developmental needs.

5. **Family Therapy:** If necessary, refer the family to family therapy sessions to address underlying communication issues and strengthen family bonds.

This report will be updated following each scheduled follow-up visit, with adjustments made to the recommended actions based on the family's progress and evolving needs.
