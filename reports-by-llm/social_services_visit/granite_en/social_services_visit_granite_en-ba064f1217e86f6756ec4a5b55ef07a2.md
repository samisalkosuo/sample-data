*Client Name:* Aino Mäkelä
*Address:* Kauppakatu 12, Hyvinkää, Finland
*Visit Date:* 06.02.2025
*Visit Type:* Child Welfare Check
*Case Severity:* Low

**Summary of Visit Purpose:**
This child welfare check was conducted to assess the living conditions and well-being of a family of five residing in a subsidized apartment in Hyvinkää, Finland. The visit aimed to ensure that the children within the household were safe, healthy, and receiving necessary support, given the low severity case context.

**Observations During the Visit:**
Upon arrival at Aino Mäkelä's residence, I was greeted by the mother, Aino, who appeared calm and cooperative. The family consists of Aino (mother), her partner Jussi, their three school-aged children (10, 8, and 5 years old), and an elderly grandmother living with them.

The apartment was clean and tidy, with age-appropriate toys and educational materials visible for the children. The children were present during the visit and engaged in their homework or playing quietly. Aino explained that they follow a structured daily routine, ensuring the children complete their homework before engaging in leisure activities.

Jussi was present during part of the visit, demonstrating an active role in childcare and household management. The elderly grandmother, who requires some assistance with daily tasks, appeared content and well cared for by the family. Aino expressed gratitude for the support services provided, acknowledging their importance in managing the household responsibilities.

**Assessment:**
The overall assessment of this low severity case indicates a stable and nurturing home environment. The family demonstrates functional dynamics, with clear roles and responsibilities. There are no immediate safety concerns or signs of neglect or abuse. The children appear healthy, well-fed, and supervised. Aino's proactive engagement with support services reflects her commitment to ensuring the best possible upbringing for her family.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up:**
Given the current stable situation, it is recommended that the family continues receiving existing support services tailored to their needs, such as parenting classes and assistance with grandparent care. A follow-up visit in three months is suggested to monitor progress and address any emerging concerns. Additionally, it would be beneficial for Aino to explore community resources and support groups to foster connections and share experiences with other families facing similar challenges.
