---

**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted to assess the parental capacity of the grandparents, Aino and Oskari Mäkelä, who are currently providing care for their three grandchildren, aged 5, 8, and 12. The case is deemed urgent due to recent concerns about the children's well-being and the grandparents' ability to meet their needs effectively.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival, the home appeared clean and organized, with basic necessities readily available. Aino Mäkelä greeted us warmly and expressed her commitment to providing a stable environment for the children. However, it was evident that she was under significant stress, which impacted her ability to engage in focused conversations.

Oskari Mäkelä was present but less involved in daily caregiving tasks. He seemed preoccupied with his own health issues, which he mentioned were affecting his energy levels and capacity to assist with the children's needs. The children appeared healthy and well-fed but displayed signs of restlessness and occasional disobedience, suggesting a lack of consistent discipline and structure in their daily routines.

**Assessment**

The grandparents' age (65 and 70) and health conditions pose potential risks to the children's long-term stability and development. While they demonstrate love and affection for the children, their limited energy and health issues hinder their ability to provide the necessary care, supervision, and emotional support consistently. The absence of the biological parents raises concerns about the children's exposure to potential neglect or inadequate care.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. Immediate referral to a pediatrician for comprehensive health assessments of all three children, focusing on developmental milestones and emotional well-being.
2. Arrangement for respite care services to alleviate the grandparents' caregiving burden and allow them opportunities for rest and rejuvenation.
3. Connection with local community support groups or parenting classes tailored for elderly caregivers to enhance their skills in managing challenging behaviors and providing structured routines for the children.
4. Initiate a search for the biological parents, prioritizing the children's right to family connections while ensuring their safety and well-being.
5. Schedule a follow-up visit within two weeks to reassess the situation, monitor progress, and adjust support strategies as necessary.

This urgent case requires prompt attention to ensure the children's immediate needs are met and to prevent potential long-term negative impacts on their development and emotional health.
