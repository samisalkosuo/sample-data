**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This follow-up visit was conducted to assess the progress and wellbeing of Aino & Jussi Virtanen, a cohabiting couple residing in Vaasa, Finland. The visit pertains to their recent domestic relocation, aimed at improving their mental health due to ongoing challenges.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival, Aino and Jussi welcomed me warmly into their newly established home. The living conditions were clean and organized, with evidence of recent decorating efforts, indicating their active engagement in creating a supportive environment. Both appeared well-groomed, suggesting improved self-care.

During our conversation, Aino expressed gratitude for the relocation, stating it has positively impacted her mood and reduced feelings of isolation. Jussi echoed similar sentiments, noting an increase in his motivation to engage in daily activities. Their emotional states appeared stable, with no signs of acute distress or crisis.

Notably, they mentioned ongoing participation in a local community mental health program, which has provided them with coping strategies and social connections. However, concerns remain regarding Jussi's occasional relapses into passive behavior, potentially linked to unresolved stressors.

**Assessment**

Given the observed improvements in the couple's living conditions, emotional stability, and active engagement with support services, the case severity is considered low. The relocation has facilitated a more conducive environment for their mental health recovery. Nevertheless, vigilance is required to address Jussi's intermittent relapses and ensure sustained progress.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. Continue bi-monthly home visits to monitor the couple's adjustment to their new environment and provide ongoing support.
2. Encourage Jussi's participation in individual therapy sessions to address underlying stressors contributing to his occasional relapses.
3. Facilitate the couple's integration into local support groups and recreational activities to foster social connections and enhance their community engagement.
4. Schedule a review meeting in three months to reassess their progress and adjust support strategies as necessary.
