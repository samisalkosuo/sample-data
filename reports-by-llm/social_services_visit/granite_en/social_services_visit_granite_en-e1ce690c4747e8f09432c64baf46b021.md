**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted as part of the ongoing refugee integration support program in Tornio, Finland. The purpose was to assess the living conditions, well-being, and integration progress of a single father with his young child, who recently arrived from a conflict zone. Given the low case severity, the focus was on ensuring the family's basic needs are met and providing guidance for successful integration into Finnish society.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at Mikko Korhonen's residence, I was greeted by a clean and modestly furnished apartment. The living conditions were adequate, with necessary furniture and basic household items present. Mikko appeared well-groomed and spoke clearly about his situation in Finnish, demonstrating good command of the language. His son, 7-year-old Elias, was present and engaged, playing quietly in a corner while we spoke.

Mikko expressed gratitude for the support received so far but mentioned challenges with employment opportunities and integrating Elias into local schooling. He showed enthusiasm about learning Finnish and participating in community activities, indicating a positive attitude towards integration. There were no immediate concerns regarding their safety or well-being.

**Assessment**

The family's living conditions are satisfactory, with Mikko demonstrating resourcefulness in managing daily life. The low case severity suggests that the family is stable and resilient, with Mikko actively seeking ways to improve their situation. However, there is room for support in employment and educational integration for Elias.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. **Employment Support:** Arrange a meeting with the local employment agency to discuss job opportunities suitable for Mikko's skills and experience. Provide information on any relevant training programs that could enhance his employability.

2. **Educational Integration for Elias:** Schedule an appointment with the school authorities to enroll Elias in a local primary school. Offer assistance in navigating the Finnish education system, including language support if necessary.

3. **Community Engagement:** Encourage Mikko's participation in community events and language classes to foster social connections and improve his integration into Finnish society.

4. **Follow-up Visit:** Plan a follow-up visit within four weeks to assess progress on employment and educational enrollment, and to address any emerging needs or concerns.

This report reflects a single interaction and assessment at the time of the visit. Continuous support and flexibility will be crucial as Mikko and Elias navigate their integration journey in Tornio.
