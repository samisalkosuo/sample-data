**Visit Details:**

Visit date: 16.04.2025  
Location: Merijärvi, Finland  
Visit type: Child visitation supervision report  
Household composition: Single adult with physical disability  
Case severity: Urgent

**Summary of Visit Purpose:**

This visit was conducted due to an urgent case involving a single adult, Eero Pitkäranta, residing alone in Merijärvi, Finland. The purpose was to assess the living conditions and supervise child visitation, given Mr. Pitkäranta's physical disability which necessitates additional support for his well-being and that of any dependent children.

**Observations During the Visit:**

Upon arrival at Mr. Pitkäranta’s residence, it was noted that while the home was clean and organized, accessibility features were minimal, posing challenges for a person with mobility issues. Mr. Pitkäranta appeared to manage daily tasks independently but required assistance with more strenuous activities.

During the visit, his emotional state seemed stable, though there was evident concern regarding his ability to safely care for any children present. A child, identified as Eero's nephew, aged 7, was observed to be well-cared for in terms of basic needs but appeared to lack consistent adult engagement and supervision.

**Assessment:**

The assessment reveals an urgent need for support services to ensure both Mr. Pitkäranta's physical safety and the appropriate care and supervision of his nephew. The living environment, while adequate, requires modifications to accommodate Mr. Pitkäranta’s disability fully, reducing potential risks associated with daily activities.

Family dynamics indicate that while Mr. Pitkäranta is capable of basic care, the absence of regular adult interaction for his nephew raises concerns about the child's social and emotional development. There is an immediate need to establish a structured routine and ensure the child receives necessary educational and recreational stimulation.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up:**

1. Arrange for a home assessment by occupational therapists to recommend and install necessary accessibility modifications in Mr. Pitkäranta's residence, prioritizing safety and ease of movement.
   
2. Coordinate with local childcare services to establish a regular supervised visitation schedule for Mr. Pitkäranta’s nephew, ensuring the child receives appropriate care and interaction during these visits.

3. Initiate a referral to a family support program that can provide guidance on parenting skills and emotional support for Mr. Pitkäranta, acknowledging his role as a caretaker.

4. Schedule a follow-up visit within one month to reassess living conditions, child welfare, and the implementation of recommended services.

This report underscores the urgency of addressing both Mr. Pitkäranta's needs for independent living with his disability and those of his nephew for proper care and development. Immediate action is required to prevent potential risks and ensure a supportive environment for all involved parties.
