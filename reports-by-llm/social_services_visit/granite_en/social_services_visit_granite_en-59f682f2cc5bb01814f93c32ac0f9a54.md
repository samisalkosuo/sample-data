---

**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This safety plan monitoring visit was conducted to assess the ongoing adherence to the established safety plan for a separated couple sharing custody of their two minor children. The critical case severity indicates heightened concerns regarding potential risks to the children's well-being due to ongoing parental conflict and instability in their living environment.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival, I observed Aino Miettinen and her ex-partner, Teppo Koskinen, engaged in a heated verbal altercation outside the residence. The children were present but appeared to be physically unharmed, though visibly distressed. The living conditions within the home were substandard; clutter and debris were scattered throughout common areas, and there was an apparent lack of essential household items such as a working stove or adequate heating.

Aino appeared agitated and defensive during our conversation, while Teppo seemed withdrawn and evasive. Both parents displayed signs of emotional distress, with Aino expressing feelings of isolation and fear, and Teppo exhibiting signs of potential substance use. The children's emotional state was concerning; they were quiet and avoidant, showing reluctance to engage with either parent or the social worker.

**Assessment**

The assessment reveals a critical situation where the parents' inability to manage conflict effectively poses significant risks to the children's safety and well-being. The deteriorating living conditions, coupled with the parents' emotional instability and potential substance use, exacerbate these concerns. The children are exposed to ongoing domestic violence, both physical and emotional, and are at risk of neglect due to their parents' preoccupation with conflict resolution.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. Immediate intervention is required to ensure the children's safety. This includes separating the parents during their custody periods to prevent direct exposure to conflict and potential violence.
2. A comprehensive psychological evaluation for both parents is recommended to address underlying issues contributing to their behavior, with a focus on anger management, stress reduction, and substance use if applicable.
3. Parenting classes should be mandated for both Aino and Teppo to develop healthy co-parenting skills and conflict resolution strategies that prioritize the children's needs.
4. The family requires access to essential resources such as food, clothing, and temporary housing to improve their living conditions. Social services should facilitate connections with local support networks, including domestic violence shelters if necessary.
5. A follow-up visit is scheduled for one week from today to reassess the situation and monitor progress on implemented recommendations. If improvements are not observed, further escalation to child protective services may be warranted.
