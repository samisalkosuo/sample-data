---

**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted to assess Aino Mäkelä's suitability for the youth mentoring program, considering her moderate case severity due to a severe mental health condition. The purpose was to evaluate her living conditions, emotional state, and overall family dynamics to determine if she would benefit from and be able to engage with the proposed mentoring support.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at Aino's apartment in Kumlinge, I found a clean and modestly furnished living space. Aino, a 45-year-old woman, greeted me warmly but appeared somewhat anxious. She spoke openly about her struggles with depression, which she has been managing with medication and occasional therapy sessions.

During our conversation, Aino expressed a strong desire for social interaction and support, particularly in engaging with local youth through the mentoring program. She demonstrated good insight into her condition and actively participates in self-care routines. However, her moderate case severity is evident in occasional bouts of low mood and difficulty concentrating, which she manages through structured daily activities.

**Assessment**

Aino's living conditions are adequate, with no immediate safety concerns noted. Her emotional state fluctuates, aligning with the moderate case severity, but she shows resilience and motivation to improve her situation. Family dynamics are limited to Aino living alone, having lost contact with extended family due to her mental health challenges.

The primary risk identified is the potential for increased isolation and subsequent depressive episodes without structured social engagement. However, Aino's proactive approach to managing her condition and her clear interest in participating in the youth mentoring program suggest a positive outlook and willingness to mitigate these risks.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

Given Aino's moderate case severity and clear interest in the youth mentoring program, it is recommended that she be enrolled. This participation could provide her with much-needed social interaction and a sense of purpose, supporting her ongoing mental health management.

I suggest coordinating with the local mentoring program coordinator to facilitate Aino's integration into an appropriate mentoring role, possibly starting with observation periods alongside experienced mentors. Additionally, it is advisable to schedule follow-up visits in two months and then monthly thereafter to monitor her progress, adjust support as necessary, and ensure the mentoring experience remains beneficial for both Aino and the young people involved.

In parallel, maintaining regular contact with her psychiatric care provider is crucial to coordinate any necessary medication adjustments or therapeutic interventions in response to changes in her mental health status or new insights gained through mentoring activities. 

This report will be shared with the relevant stakeholders, including Aino's healthcare providers and the youth mentoring program coordinator, to ensure a collaborative approach to supporting Aino Mäkelä effectively.
