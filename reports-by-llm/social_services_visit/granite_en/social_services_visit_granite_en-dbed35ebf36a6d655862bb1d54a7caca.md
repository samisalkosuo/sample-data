---

**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted to assess the needs and circumstances of Aino Mäkelä and Teemu Rantala, an unaccompanied young couple residing in Kuhmo, Finland. The purpose was to evaluate their living conditions, emotional well-being, and overall suitability for raising their first child, considering their moderate case severity.

**Observations During the Visit**

Aino Mäkelä (19) and Teemu Rantala (20) appeared clean and well-groomed during the visit. Their home, a modest two-bedroom apartment, was tidy and organized, with evidence of ongoing efforts to prepare for their child's arrival. The couple displayed a positive and cooperative demeanor throughout the interview process.

Aino expressed excitement about the upcoming birth but also acknowledged her apprehension regarding the responsibilities that lie ahead. Teemu demonstrated a strong sense of commitment to supporting Aino and their future child, expressing eagerness to learn parenting skills and provide a stable environment.

Notable concerns include limited financial resources and a lack of extended family support within Kuhmo. Both Aino and Teemu are currently unemployed, with Teemu pursuing vocational training in carpentry, expected to conclude by early 2025. Their housing situation is stable but precarious, as they pay rent month-to-month without a long-term lease agreement.

**Assessment**

The young couple's moderate case severity stems from their financial constraints and the absence of an established support network. While Aino and Teemu exhibit genuine dedication to their impending parenthood, they require guidance and resources to navigate the challenges ahead. Their living conditions are adequate but vulnerable to instability due to employment uncertainties.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. **Financial Support:** Connect Aino and Teemu with local social welfare services for financial assistance applications, including child support benefits and potential housing subsidies.
2. **Parenting Education:** Enroll the couple in a comprehensive parenting program to equip them with essential skills and knowledge for raising their child.
3. **Employment Support:** Facilitate Teemu's transition from vocational training to employment by linking him with job placement services and potential employers within Kuhmo.
4. **Community Resources:** Introduce the family to local parent support groups and community resources, fostering a sense of belonging and reducing feelings of isolation.
5. **Follow-up Visit:** Schedule a follow-up assessment in three months to reevaluate their progress, address any emerging concerns, and adjust support strategies as needed.

This report aims to provide Aino Mäkelä and Teemu Rantala with the necessary resources and guidance to ensure a stable foundation for raising their first child in Kuhmo, Finland.
