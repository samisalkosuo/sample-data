**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted as part of the refugee integration support program in Orivesi, Finland. The purpose was to assess the living conditions and support needs of an elderly woman, Aino Korhonen, who is experiencing early symptoms of dementia. Given her status as a refugee, it is crucial to ensure she receives appropriate care and resources to maintain her well-being within the community.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at Ms. Korhonen's residence on Kauppakatu, I was greeted by a clean and modestly furnished apartment. The environment appeared safe and free of hazards, which is commendable considering her cognitive condition. Ms. Korhonen, in her late seventies, was present and responsive but exhibited mild confusion regarding the date and time. She expressed gratitude for my visit, indicating a positive emotional state despite her challenges.

During our conversation, it became evident that while she understands her condition, she sometimes struggles with daily tasks such as meal preparation and medication management. Neighbors were noted to be supportive, occasionally checking in on her, which alleviates some concerns about social isolation.

**Assessment**

The assessment reveals a low-severity case primarily due to Ms. Korhonen's stable living conditions and the absence of immediate health crises. Her early dementia symptoms are manageable with appropriate support. The household dynamics are favorable, with neighbors offering informal assistance, which is beneficial for her integration into the community.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. **Cognitive Support:** Arrange for a cognitive stimulation therapy program tailored for individuals with early-stage dementia to help maintain cognitive function and slow potential progression.

2. **Home Care Services:** Coordinate with local home care services to provide assistance with daily living activities, ensuring her safety and independence.

3. **Community Integration:** Facilitate Ms. Korhonen's participation in community-based activities designed for seniors, fostering social engagement and reducing feelings of isolation.

4. **Regular Check-ins:** Schedule bi-monthly follow-up visits to monitor her condition, adjust support as necessary, and offer reassurance and companionship.

5. **Healthcare Coordination:** Liaise with healthcare providers to ensure comprehensive care, including regular cognitive assessments and medication reviews.

This report will be shared with the relevant social service coordinators and healthcare professionals involved in Ms. Korhonen's care to ensure a cohesive support plan. Further updates will be provided following the implementation of recommended actions.
