---

**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted to assess the disability support needs of an unaccompanied minor residing temporarily in Jomala, Finland. The purpose was to evaluate the child's living conditions, identify any potential risks, and determine appropriate support services.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at Aino Mäkelä's temporary housing on Kauppakatu, I found a clean and well-maintained environment suitable for a single occupant. The minor, 14-year-old Anna Mäkelä, was present and cooperative during the assessment. She appeared to be in good health, with no immediate signs of distress or disability.

Anna engaged actively in conversation, expressing her interest in attending a local vocational school for students with learning difficulties. She mentioned having some difficulty focusing on tasks and completing assignments due to an undiagnosed condition suspected to be ADHD by her previous school. Anna's emotional state was positive, displaying resilience and determination despite the temporary nature of her housing situation.

**Assessment**

Given Anna's age, unaccompanied status, and expressed learning difficulties, there is a low risk for immediate harm or neglect. However, it is crucial to address her educational needs promptly to prevent potential long-term challenges. The temporary housing arrangement appears safe and adequate, with no notable concerns regarding living conditions or family dynamics, as Anna is an unaccompanied minor without known family support in Finland at this time.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. Arrange for a comprehensive evaluation by a pediatric psychologist to confirm the suspected ADHD and recommend appropriate interventions or accommodations.
   
2. Facilitate Anna's enrollment in the identified vocational school, ensuring any necessary support services are in place before her start date.

3. Coordinate with local social workers to explore long-term housing solutions, including potential guardianship or foster care arrangements if appropriate and in line with Finnish legal requirements.

4. Schedule a follow-up visit within one month to review Anna's progress in school and housing stability, adjusting support plans as needed based on her development and emerging needs. 

This report concludes the initial assessment of Anna Mäkelä's situation. Further updates will be provided following the recommended actions and subsequent visits.
