---

**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted to review the support plan for Ms. Anna Korhonen, a single caregiver residing in Vantaa, Finland, who provides care for her elderly parent suffering from dementia. The purpose was to assess the ongoing effectiveness of the current support measures and make necessary adjustments to ensure the well-being of both Ms. Korhonen and her parent.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival, Ms. Korhonen greeted me warmly and led me through their home. The living conditions were clean and organized, with essential care equipment readily available. Her parent, Mr. Korhonen, was present and appeared calm during our conversation. Anna expressed a moderate level of stress but remained composed and engaged in the discussion about their daily routines and challenges.

**Assessment**

The current support plan appears to be adequately addressing the needs of both Ms. Korhonen and her parent, given the low case severity. Anna effectively manages daily care tasks, including medication reminders and meal preparation. However, she occasionally experiences isolation due to limited social interaction outside of caregiving responsibilities.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. Encourage participation in local support groups for caregivers to foster a sense of community and provide opportunities for respite.
2. Arrange a home health assessment to ensure that all necessary care equipment is functioning correctly and to identify any potential hazards in the living environment.
3. Schedule a follow-up visit in two months to reassess the support plan's effectiveness and address any emerging needs or concerns.
4. Provide information about available community resources, such as adult day care programs, to alleviate some of Anna's caregiving burden and offer her parent additional social engagement opportunities.
