**Social Services Visit Report**

*Client Name:* Aino Mäkelä
*Address:* Kauppakatu 12, Lapinjärvi, Finland
*Visit Date:* 22.11.2024
*Visit Type:* Family Reunification Progress Check
*Case Severity:* Moderate

**Summary of Visit Purpose:**
This visit was conducted to assess the progress of a teenager in foster care (Aino Mäkelä) towards family reunification, as per the moderate severity case context. The purpose was to evaluate the living conditions, emotional state, and family dynamics, ensuring the safety and well-being of the teenager while considering potential reintegration with their biological family.

**Observations During the Visit:**
Aino resides in a clean, modestly furnished foster home in Lapinjärvi. The foster parents were present and cooperative during our interaction. Aino appeared well-groomed and engaged in conversation, displaying a generally positive emotional state. She expressed interest in attending school and participating in extracurricular activities, indicating a willingness to integrate into her current environment.

During the visit, Aino shared that she maintains regular contact with her biological family through supervised visits and phone calls. While there is evident affection between Aino and her family members, concerns arose regarding inconsistent attendance at scheduled family therapy sessions by the parents. This inconsistency may hinder progress towards reunification goals.

**Assessment:**
The teenager's living conditions are satisfactory, with a supportive foster family providing a stable environment. Aino demonstrates emotional resilience and a desire to engage in her community. However, the moderate case severity highlights ongoing challenges related to inconsistent participation in family therapy by the biological parents. This inconsistency poses a risk to the teenager's long-term well-being and successful reunification prospects.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up:**
1. Encourage and support the biological parents' consistent attendance at family therapy sessions, emphasizing their active role in addressing underlying issues that led to the placement of Aino in foster care.
2. Collaborate with the therapist to develop a structured plan for the family, including clear goals and timelines for achieving reunification milestones.
3. Schedule a follow-up visit in three months to reassess progress, focusing on improvements in family dynamics, parental engagement, and Aino's emotional well-being.
4. Provide additional resources or support services if needed, such as parenting classes or individual counseling for the biological parents, to strengthen their capacity for successful reunification.
