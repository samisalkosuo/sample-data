---

**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted as a follow-up to the parenting education program that Jussi Koskinen, a single father residing in Orimattila, Finland, had previously engaged with. The purpose was to assess his progress, evaluate the implementation of learned skills in daily life, and identify any ongoing needs or challenges.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at Jussi's home, the environment appeared clean and organized, albeit modestly furnished. His seven-year-old son, Elias, was present and engaged in quiet play. Jussi greeted me warmly and demonstrated a clear affection for his child. During our conversation, he expressed enthusiasm about the parenting education program and shared specific techniques he had adopted, such as positive reinforcement and active listening.

Jussi's interactions with Elias were generally patient and supportive. However, there were moments of frustration when Elias struggled with his homework, indicating a need for additional support in this area. Jussi acknowledged feeling overwhelmed at times but expressed determination to improve his coping strategies.

**Assessment**

Jussi has shown moderate progress since participating in the parenting education program. He demonstrates a genuine commitment to applying learned skills and fostering a nurturing environment for Elias. The primary concern remains Elias's academic development, as evidenced by Jussi's admission of feeling ill-equipped to assist with homework. This situation poses a moderate risk of exacerbating any potential behavioral issues in Elias and may impact his school performance.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. **Educational Support:** Arrange a referral to the local educational psychologist for an assessment of Elias's learning needs and to provide Jussi with strategies to better support his son's education at home.
2. **Parenting Skills Reinforcement:** Schedule bi-weekly group sessions focusing on managing challenging behaviors and enhancing communication skills, tailored for single parents.
3. **Community Resources:** Connect Jussi with local parent groups and community centers offering activities for children and parents to foster social integration and provide additional support networks.
4. **Follow-up Visit:** Plan a return visit in four weeks to reassess progress, address any emerging concerns, and reinforce ongoing support strategies.

This report reflects a professional evaluation of Jussi Koskinen's situation, highlighting both his strengths and areas requiring further attention. The recommended actions aim to bolster his parenting capabilities and ensure Elias receives the necessary educational and emotional support.
