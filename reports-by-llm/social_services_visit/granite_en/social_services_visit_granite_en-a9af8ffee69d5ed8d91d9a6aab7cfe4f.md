**Case Severity:** High

---

**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted to assess the disability support needs of a teenager currently residing in foster care due to high case severity. The purpose was to evaluate the living conditions, interactions, behaviors, emotional state, and overall family dynamics to determine appropriate interventions and support services.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at Aino M채kel채's residence in Siikajoki, the teenager, 15-year-old Eeva, was present along with her designated foster parent, Mr. Jari Koskinen. The living conditions were adequate but showed signs of neglect, with some areas cluttered and in disarray.

Eeva appeared withdrawn and quiet during the initial interaction, displaying difficulty in maintaining eye contact and exhibiting signs of anxiety. She communicated using simple sentences and seemed to struggle with expressing her needs or emotions. Mr. Koskinen expressed concern over Eeva's behavioral challenges, including occasional aggressive outbursts and difficulty engaging in daily routines.

**Assessment**

Given the high case severity, it is evident that Eeva requires comprehensive disability support to address her developmental needs effectively. The observed emotional distress, behavioral issues, and communication difficulties suggest a potential diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) or another neurodevelopmental condition.

The current foster care environment, while providing a stable home, lacks specialized support tailored to Eeva's unique needs. The absence of structured routines and limited access to therapeutic interventions exacerbate her challenges in daily functioning and emotional regulation.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. Immediate referral for a comprehensive assessment by a multidisciplinary team, including a developmental pediatrician and a clinical psychologist specializing in ASD, to confirm the diagnosis and develop an individualized support plan.
2. Collaboration with local schools to ensure Eeva's educational needs are met through appropriate accommodations and specialized instruction.
3. Arrange for regular therapeutic interventions, such as Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) or occupational therapy, to address behavioral challenges and enhance daily living skills.
4. Provide foster parent training focused on understanding Eeva's specific needs, effective communication strategies, and behavior management techniques.
5. Schedule a follow-up visit in four weeks to monitor progress, reassess needs, and adjust support services as necessary.

This report underscores the urgency for timely intervention to mitigate the high case severity and ensure Eeva's well-being and developmental growth within her foster care environment.
