**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted as part of ongoing mental health monitoring for Eero Korhonen and his sibling, who share housing in Helsinki. The purpose was to assess their current living conditions, emotional states, and overall well-being, given the moderate severity of their case.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at Kalevantie 12, Eero Korhonen, aged 35, and his 38-year-old sibling, welcomed me into their shared apartment. The living conditions were moderately clean, with some signs of disorganization. Both individuals appeared well-groomed but displayed varying levels of emotional engagement during our interaction.

Eero seemed withdrawn and expressed difficulty in articulating his feelings, occasionally becoming non-responsive. His sibling, while more verbally expressive, exhibited signs of heightened anxiety, frequently interrupting Eero's responses to offer her own perspectives or concerns.

There were no immediate safety risks observed within the home, but the tension between the siblings was palpable, suggesting potential for escalation under stress. Both reported sleep disturbances and appetite changes, which they attributed to ongoing life challenges.

**Assessment**

The assessment indicates a moderate case severity, primarily driven by Eero's mental health struggles, which appear to be impacting his daily functioning and interpersonal relationships. His sibling's anxiety seems to be both a reaction to Eero's condition and a manifestation of her own unmet needs for support and recognition within the household.

The family dynamics suggest a cycle where Eero's mental health issues exacerbate his sibling's stress, which in turn may hinder effective coping strategies for both parties. There is a risk of further deterioration in Eeroâ€™s condition without targeted intervention and support.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. **Psychological Evaluation for Eero:** Arrange a comprehensive psychological assessment to better understand the nature and extent of his mental health concerns. This should include cognitive and emotional functioning tests, as well as a clinical interview.

2. **Sibling Support Group:** Enroll both siblings in a support group facilitated by a mental health professional. This will provide Eero with peer understanding and coping strategies while offering his sibling a platform to express her concerns and learn supportive behaviors.

3. **Individual Therapy for Sibling:** Initiate individual therapy sessions for the sibling to address her anxiety and develop healthier response patterns to stress, particularly those related to caring for Eero.

4. **Case Review in 8 Weeks:** Schedule a follow-up visit to reassess progress, adjust interventions as necessary, and ensure adherence to recommended therapies.

This report will be shared with the involved healthcare providers to coordinate care effectively and ensure continuity of support for Eero Korhonen and his sibling.
