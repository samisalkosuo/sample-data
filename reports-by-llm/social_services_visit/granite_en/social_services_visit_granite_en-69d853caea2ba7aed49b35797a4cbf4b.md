**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted to assess the disability support needs of a minor child residing with their non-custodial relative, Aino Korhonen, in Lieto, Finland. The purpose was to evaluate the living conditions, family dynamics, and identify any potential risks or areas requiring intervention due to the moderate case severity.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at Ms. Korhonen's residence, the child, 10-year-old Mikko Korhonen, was present and appeared to be managing daily activities with some independence. The living conditions were adequate, though slightly cluttered, indicating potential challenges in maintaining organization and cleanliness.

Mikko communicated openly about his needs, mentioning difficulties with certain school tasks due to dyslexia. He expressed frustration but remained cooperative during the assessment. Ms. Korhonen demonstrated a willingness to support her nephew, though she acknowledged feeling overwhelmed at times by his special needs and her part-time working schedule.

**Assessment**

The assessment revealed that while Mikko's basic needs are met, there are moderate concerns regarding his educational progress and emotional well-being due to his undiagnosed learning disability. Ms. Korhonen, though supportive, lacks specialized knowledge to effectively address these challenges, potentially leading to increased stress within the household. There is a risk of Mikko's self-esteem being negatively impacted if his needs are not adequately supported.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. **Educational Support:** Arrange for a comprehensive educational assessment by a specialist to identify and address Mikkoâ€™s learning difficulties, ensuring he receives appropriate accommodations at school.
   
2. **Parenting Skills Workshop:** Recommend Ms. Korhonen participate in a parenting skills workshop focused on strategies for supporting children with disabilities, enhancing her confidence and capabilities.

3. **Regular Follow-up:** Schedule bi-monthly follow-up visits to monitor Mikko's progress, provide ongoing support to Ms. Korhonen, and adjust intervention strategies as necessary.

4. **Community Resources:** Connect the family with local disability support groups for peer support and additional resources tailored to their needs.

By implementing these recommendations, we aim to mitigate current risks, enhance Mikko's educational outcomes, and strengthen the caregiving capacity of his aunt, ultimately fostering a more stable and nurturing environment for the child.
