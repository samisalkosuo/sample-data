---

**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This homeless outreach visit was conducted to assess the living conditions and support needs of a household in Kauniainen, Finland, where grandparents are caring for their grandchildren due to parental homelessness. The visit aimed to evaluate the family's current situation, identify any immediate risks or concerns, and determine appropriate support services.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at the modest apartment on Kauppakatu, I was greeted by Eino Korhonen, a 62-year-old grandfather, and his wife, 58-year-old Aino. Their two grandchildren, 10-year-old Markku and 7-year-old Maija, were present. The living conditions were basic but clean, with limited furniture and personal belongings.

Eino and Aino appeared tired but warm and welcoming. They expressed gratitude for the support services already in place, such as food parcels from a local church. However, they voiced concerns about the children's education and lack of privacy due to shared living spaces. Both grandparents reported occasional sleep disturbances due to the children's nighttime anxieties.

The children seemed healthy and engaged, attending school regularly. Markku mentioned missing his friends and struggling with homework without consistent internet access at home. Maija, while shy, appeared content playing with a few toys.

**Assessment**

The family's situation presents moderate case severity due to the grandparents' age and health limitations, coupled with the children's need for stability and routine. The lack of a permanent residence for the parents poses ongoing risks, including potential disruptions to the children's education and emotional well-being.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. **Housing Support:** Initiate an application for social housing, prioritizing the family's need for a stable living environment. Collaborate with local housing authorities to expedite the process.
   
2. **Educational Assistance:** Connect the family with educational support services to address Markku's homework challenges and ensure Maija's developmental needs are met. This may include access to school resources or tutoring programs.

3. **Mental Health Support:** Arrange a referral to a local counseling service for the grandparents to manage stress and sleep issues, ensuring they can provide a nurturing environment for the children.

4. **Regular Follow-up:** Schedule bi-monthly visits to monitor progress, adjust support as needed, and maintain open communication with the family regarding any changes in their circumstances or available resources.

This report will be shared with relevant stakeholders, including local housing authorities, educational institutions, and mental health providers, to ensure a coordinated response to the family's needs.
