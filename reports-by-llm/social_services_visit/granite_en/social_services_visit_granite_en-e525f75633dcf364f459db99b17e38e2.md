**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted due to an urgent report of potential child neglect within a two-parent household in Raahe, Finland. The case context involves concerns about the parents' ability to provide necessary care and support for their disabled child, who requires regular assistance with daily living activities.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at the Korhonen residence, I was greeted by Aino (mother) and Jussi (father). The parents appeared disheveled and exhibited signs of stress. Their home was cluttered, with limited cleanliness, and there were safety hazards such as unsecured electrical cords near the child's play area.

The disabled child, 7-year-old Leo, was present in the living room. He appeared withdrawn and showed signs of developmental delays, struggling with basic motor skills and communication. Leo was observed to be left unattended for extended periods while his parents attended to household chores, posing a risk to his safety and well-being.

**Assessment**

The assessment reveals an urgent situation where the parents' inability to manage their child's needs and maintain a safe living environment puts Leo at significant risk of harm. The family dynamics indicate that both parents are overwhelmed by the demands of caring for Leo, coupled with their own emotional distress. There is an immediate need for intervention to ensure Leo's safety and well-being.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. **Immediate Intervention:** Arrange for a pediatrician's assessment of Leo to evaluate his developmental needs and provide appropriate medical support.
2. **Home Safety Evaluation:** Engage a professional cleaner to address the hazardous living conditions and establish a safer environment for Leo.
3. **Parental Support:** Refer Aino and Jussi Korhonen to parenting classes and stress management workshops tailored for families dealing with disabled children, emphasizing caregiving skills and emotional resilience.
4. **Regular Monitoring:** Schedule bi-weekly home visits by a social worker to monitor Leo's well-being, assess the parents' progress in parenting skills, and ensure adherence to safety measures.
5. **Emergency Contacts:** Establish an emergency contact list involving extended family, neighbors, and local support groups who can provide additional assistance if needed.
6. **Case Review:** Conduct a comprehensive case review within one month to reassess Leo's needs, the parents' capacity for care, and the effectiveness of implemented interventions.

This report underscores the urgency of addressing the Korhonen family's situation to prevent further deterioration in Leo's health and development. Prompt and coordinated action from social services is imperative to mitigate identified risks and ensure the child's safety and well-being.
