---

**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This post-abuse recovery support visit was conducted to assess the well-being of the grandchildren under the care of their grandparents, Aino Mäkelä and her husband, following a reported incident of emotional abuse. The purpose was to provide reassurance, resources, and support to help the family navigate this challenging period and promote healing.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at Aino Mäkelä's residence, the environment appeared clean and organized. The grandparents welcomed me warmly, expressing gratitude for the support. The children, aged 8 and 10, were present and engaged in quiet play. They seemed comfortable in their surroundings, and there were no immediate signs of distress or fear.

Aino Mäkelä shared that her daughter, the parents of the grandchildren, had temporarily relocated due to ongoing marital issues. She expressed concern about her daughter's mental health and the impact this situation might have on the children. The grandparents are actively involved in providing emotional support and routine stability for the children.

**Assessment**

The case severity is currently low, as there are no immediate safety concerns or signs of ongoing abuse. However, the family is navigating a complex emotional landscape due to the parents' separation and mental health challenges. The grandparents demonstrate a strong commitment to their grandchildren's well-being and are proactive in seeking support.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. **Counseling Services:** Arrange for family counseling sessions to address the emotional needs of both the grandparents and grandchildren. This will provide a safe space for processing their experiences and fostering open communication.

2. **Parental Support Groups:** Connect the parents, once they are ready, with local support groups for individuals dealing with marital issues and mental health challenges. This can offer peer support and coping strategies.

3. **Regular Check-ins:** Schedule bi-monthly follow-up visits to monitor progress, address any emerging concerns, and provide ongoing support to the family.

4. **Community Resources:** Introduce the family to community resources such as playgroups or educational workshops that can enrich the children's lives and offer additional social interaction opportunities.

By implementing these recommendations, we aim to bolster the family's resilience, facilitate healing, and ensure the children's continued well-being within their current care arrangement.
