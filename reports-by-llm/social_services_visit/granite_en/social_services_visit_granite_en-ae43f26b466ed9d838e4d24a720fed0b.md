---

**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted as a follow-up to an initial elderly care assessment for Aino Mäkelä, an 82-year-old resident living in a multi-generational household experiencing financial difficulties. The purpose was to evaluate the ongoing support needs and ensure that the family's situation had not deteriorated since the last visit.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival, I was greeted by Aino Mäkelä, who appeared well-groomed and in good spirits. She was seated comfortably in her living room, surrounded by her adult children and grandchildren. The atmosphere was warm and supportive, with family members engaged in conversation and assisting Aino with daily tasks.

The living conditions were modest but clean and organized. There were signs of shared resources, such as a single television and a communal dining table for meals. Financial difficulties were evident in the limited household appliances and occasional reliance on second-hand items.

Aino's cognitive function seemed intact, and she was able to communicate her needs clearly. Her children demonstrated patience and understanding, ensuring their mother's comfort and safety. There were no immediate concerns regarding neglect or abuse, and the family dynamics appeared functional despite the financial strain.

**Assessment**

Given Aino's age and the low case severity, her current support needs are primarily focused on maintaining her independence within the household. The family's financial difficulties pose a risk of social isolation due to limited access to resources and community activities. However, the strong familial bonds and mutual support mitigate this risk significantly.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. Continue bi-monthly follow-up visits to monitor Aino's well-being and the family's evolving needs.
2. Connect the family with local financial counseling services to address their economic challenges and explore potential assistance programs.
3. Encourage participation in community centers or senior groups to foster social engagement and alleviate feelings of isolation.
4. Schedule a review visit in three months to reassess the family's situation and adjust support strategies as necessary.

This report reflects a comprehensive evaluation of Aino Mäkelä's elderly care needs within her multi-generational household, considering their financial constraints. The recommended actions aim to bolster the family's resilience and ensure Aino's continued well-being.
