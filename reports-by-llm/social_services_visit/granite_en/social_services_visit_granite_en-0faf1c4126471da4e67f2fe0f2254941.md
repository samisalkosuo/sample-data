**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted to assess the disability support needs of Aino Mäkelä, a teenage mother residing with her parents and infant in Laitila, Finland. The purpose was to evaluate the family's current living conditions, identify any potential risks, and determine if additional support services are required.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival, Aino welcomed us warmly, displaying a calm and cooperative demeanor. She appeared well-groomed and seemed to have a good understanding of her infant's needs. The family resides in a modest, clean, and organized home. Mikko and Päivi were present during the visit, demonstrating active involvement in caring for Aino and the baby.

Aino reported that she is receiving basic financial assistance and access to healthcare services for herself and the infant. She expressed gratitude for the support but mentioned occasional feelings of isolation due to limited social interaction with other young parents. The infant appeared healthy, well-fed, and content throughout our visit.

**Assessment**

The Mäkelä family's living conditions are satisfactory, with adequate resources for the immediate needs of Aino and her infant. There were no apparent signs of neglect or abuse, and the parents displayed genuine concern and commitment to their daughter and grandchild.

Given Aino's young age and recent motherhood, there is a low risk of significant challenges in managing daily tasks or accessing necessary support services. However, her expressed feelings of isolation warrant attention to ensure her emotional well-being and prevent potential long-term consequences.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. Connect Aino with local parenting support groups or community centers to foster social interaction and provide a platform for sharing experiences and learning from other young parents.
2. Schedule a follow-up visit in three months to reassess her emotional well-being, social integration, and any emerging needs.
3. Encourage Aino to participate in parenting classes or workshops offered by local organizations to enhance her confidence and skills in caring for her infant.
4. Maintain open communication with the family to address any concerns that may arise and provide timely support as needed.

This report reflects a comprehensive assessment of the Mäkelä family's situation, considering their low case severity. The recommended actions aim to bolster Aino's emotional resilience and facilitate her integration into the community, ensuring the best possible outcomes for both mother and infant.
