**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This follow-up visit was conducted to assess the progress of Aino Mäkelä and her former partner, Jari Kivinen, in implementing the parenting education strategies discussed during our previous session. The aim was to ensure that the shared custody arrangement is beneficial for their children's development and well-being.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at Aino Mäkelä's residence, I observed a clean and organized living space, indicating good housekeeping habits. Both parents were present, engaging in a calm conversation with their children. The children appeared happy and well-cared for, participating actively in their homework and playtime.

Aino and Jari demonstrated respectful communication, focusing on their children's needs during the visit. They shared their experiences since our last meeting, highlighting improvements in conflict resolution and cooperation when exchanging their children. Both parents expressed satisfaction with the current custody arrangement and reported fewer disagreements.

**Assessment**

The family dynamics appear stable and supportive, with low-risk factors identified. Aino and Jari have successfully integrated the parenting education strategies into their daily routines, fostering a nurturing environment for their children. The shared custody arrangement seems to be working well, promoting consistency and stability in the children's lives.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

Given the positive developments, it is recommended that Aino and Jari continue their current parenting practices. However, I suggest scheduling another follow-up visit in six months to monitor their progress and address any potential challenges that may arise as the children grow.

In addition, I recommend exploring community resources such as parent support groups or workshops focused on adolescent development to further enhance their parenting skills. Aino and Jari can contact the local Kökar Family Center for more information on available programs.
