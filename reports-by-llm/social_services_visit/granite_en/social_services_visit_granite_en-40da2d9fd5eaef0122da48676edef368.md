---

**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted to assess the disability support needs of Aino Mäkelä and her family, who reside in Saarijärvi, Finland. The family has a documented history of chronic domestic violence, necessitating a comprehensive evaluation of their living conditions, emotional well-being, and potential disability impacts.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at Aino Mäkelä's residence, I was greeted by Aino herself, who appeared visibly anxious but cooperative. The living conditions were moderately cluttered, with signs of recent disturbances, such as overturned furniture and damaged walls. Aino's teenage daughter, Eeva, was present during the visit, displaying signs of emotional distress and avoiding eye contact.

Aino reported experiencing chronic pain due to a previous injury sustained during an incident of domestic violence. She mentioned difficulty sleeping and concentrating, which she believes are exacerbated by the ongoing tension in her home. Eeva, who has been absent from school for several weeks, expressed a desire to return but fears confrontations with her father.

**Assessment**

The family's history of chronic domestic violence poses significant risks to their emotional and physical well-being. Aino's reported chronic pain and resulting cognitive difficulties suggest a need for disability support services, including pain management and mental health counseling. Eeva's school absence and fear of her father indicate the urgent need for child protection measures and family therapy.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. Immediate referral to a local mental health professional for Aino's pain management and anxiety treatment.
2. Arrangement for Eeva's safe return to school, including discussions with school authorities regarding her situation and potential support measures.
3. Coordination with the police or relevant authorities to ensure ongoing safety and enforce any existing restraining orders against the abusive family member.
4. Scheduling a follow-up visit in two weeks to assess progress and adjust support strategies as necessary.
5. Exploration of additional community resources, such as support groups for victims of domestic violence and parenting classes focused on non-violent communication.
