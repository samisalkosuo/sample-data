**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted to verify the emergency housing needs of Ms. Aino Mäkelä, a woman who has recently disclosed experiencing domestic abuse. The purpose was to assess her immediate living conditions and ensure she has access to necessary support services as she transitions away from an abusive environment.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at Ms. Mäkelä's residence, I found a modest apartment that appeared clean and well-maintained. Aino greeted me warmly, displaying a calm demeanor despite her recent traumatic experience. She expressed gratitude for the support services offered by social work and shared that she feels safer since leaving her abusive partner.

During our conversation, Ms. Mäkelä mentioned having limited financial resources but emphasized her determination to rebuild her life independently. There were no immediate signs of distress or ongoing threat, aligning with the low case severity assessment. However, it was noted that she could benefit from emotional support and possibly financial assistance to stabilize her situation further.

**Assessment**

The current living conditions are adequate for Ms. Mäkelä's immediate needs, providing a safe environment free from her abuser. The low case severity indicates that while she has successfully escaped an abusive situation, there remains a need for ongoing support to address potential long-term challenges associated with domestic violence survivorship.

Family dynamics are currently nonexistent within the household as Ms. Mäkelä is estranged from her abusive partner and has no children residing with her. Her support network appears limited, primarily consisting of distant relatives who live in different regions of Finland.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. **Immediate Support:** Arrange for Ms. Mäkelä to attend a series of counseling sessions with a trauma specialist to address the psychological impacts of domestic abuse.

2. **Financial Assistance:** Initiate an application for financial aid through local welfare services to help cover basic living expenses and potentially access vocational training or employment support programs.

3. **Community Resources:** Connect Ms. Mäkelä with local women's shelters or support groups in Sonkajärvi to foster a sense of community and provide additional emotional backing.

4. **Follow-up Visit:** Schedule a follow-up visit within two weeks to reassess her situation, ensure engagement with recommended services, and offer ongoing support.

This report will be shared with the relevant caseworkers and service providers to coordinate comprehensive care for Ms. Mäkelä as she navigates this critical phase of recovery.
