**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This routine family wellbeing visit was conducted to assess the living conditions and support needs of the Koskinen family, where grandparents Aino (68) and Jussi (72) are providing care for their three grandchildren: 10-year-old Sanna, 8-year-old Eero, and 4-year-old Mika. The high case severity indicates a significant risk to the children's wellbeing due to the advanced age of the caregivers and potential strain on their resources.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival, the home appeared tidy but showed signs of wear, with some minor maintenance issues such as a leaking faucet and peeling paint. The living space was modest, yet functional, housing all necessary furniture and children's belongings. Aino and Jussi were warm and welcoming, demonstrating genuine affection for their grandchildren. However, it was evident that the grandparents struggled with daily tasks like carrying groceries or assisting children with personal care due to age-related mobility limitations.

Sanna, Eero, and Mika appeared healthy and well-nourished but exhibited signs of fatigue, possibly from the demands of their daily routine. The children engaged in quiet play, likely out of respect for their grandparents' need for rest. Aino expressed concern about her ability to meet the children's educational needs, particularly with Sanna preparing for school entrance exams.

**Assessment**

The assessment reveals a high-risk situation primarily due to the advanced age of the caregivers and their limited capacity to manage daily activities and provide comprehensive emotional support to the children. The lack of respite for Aino and Jussi could lead to burnout, potentially compromising the children's wellbeing in the long term. Additionally, there is an immediate need to address Sannaâ€™s educational preparation for school, which currently falls short due to insufficient resources and time constraints on her grandparents.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. **Home Support Services:** Arrange for a home maintenance check to rectify minor issues and improve the living environment's safety and comfort.
2. **Respite Care:** Facilitate access to respite care services to provide Aino and Jussi with regular breaks, ensuring they can recharge and maintain their capacity to care for the children effectively.
3. **Educational Support:** Connect the family with local educational resources or tutoring programs to assist Sanna in preparing for school, addressing any learning gaps identified.
4. **Community Resources:** Introduce the family to community centers or support groups where they can access additional resources, social interaction for both children and grandparents, and emotional support.
5. **Follow-up Visit:** Schedule a follow-up visit within four weeks to reassess the situation, monitor progress on implemented recommendations, and adjust support strategies as necessary.

This report underscores the urgent need for intervention to safeguard the wellbeing of Sanna, Eero, and Mika while supporting Aino and Jussi in their caregiving role. Immediate action is crucial to mitigate identified risks and ensure a nurturing environment for these vulnerable children.
