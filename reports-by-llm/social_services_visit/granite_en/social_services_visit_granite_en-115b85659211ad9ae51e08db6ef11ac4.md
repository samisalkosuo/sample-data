---

**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted to assess the disability support needs of Aino Soini, a transitional housing resident following rehabilitation. The purpose was to evaluate her current living conditions, functional abilities, and identify any additional support requirements to facilitate her successful integration into independent living.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at Ms. Soini's residence, I found a clean and organized living space suitable for her needs. Aino appeared well-groomed and was polite during our interaction. She expressed gratitude for the support provided by the transitional housing program. During conversation, she demonstrated moderate cognitive functioning and was able to articulate her daily activities and challenges.

Aino uses a mobility aid (a cane) due to balance issues post-stroke. She reported some difficulty with fine motor skills, affecting tasks like dressing and meal preparation. Despite these challenges, she expressed determination to improve her independence through practice and potential assistive devices. Her emotional state was positive, though there were moments of frustration related to her ongoing rehabilitation process.

**Assessment**

Aino Soini's case presents a moderate severity level, primarily due to physical limitations resulting from a recent stroke. While she resides in transitional housing that meets basic needs, her functional limitations in mobility and fine motor skills pose challenges to achieving full independence. There are no immediate safety concerns noted within the living environment. Family dynamics are supportive, with regular contact and encouragement from her adult daughter who lives nearby.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. **Physical Therapy Referral:** Arrange for a physical therapist to assess Aino's mobility needs and recommend appropriate assistive devices (e.g., reachers, dressing sticks) to enhance her fine motor skills and independence in daily activities.

2. **Occupational Therapy Evaluation:** Schedule an occupational therapy consultation to explore adaptive strategies for kitchen tasks and home management, focusing on energy conservation techniques.

3. **Community Integration Support:** Connect Aino with local community resources such as support groups for stroke survivors to foster peer interaction and emotional well-being.

4. **Follow-up Visit:** Plan a follow-up assessment in four weeks to review progress, reassess needs, and adjust the support plan accordingly. 

This report encapsulates the findings from today's visit to Aino Soini. It outlines immediate actionable steps to address her moderate disability support needs, ensuring she receives the necessary resources for a smoother transition towards independent living in Soini, Finland.
