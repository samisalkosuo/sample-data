---

**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This homeless outreach visit was conducted in response to a high-severity case involving a disabled adult, Jari Pitk채ranta, and his live-in caregiver, Anna Koskinen. The purpose was to assess their living conditions, evaluate immediate needs, and identify potential support services to alleviate the high severity of their situation.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at Jari's residence, a small, one-bedroom apartment on Kauppakatu in Eurajoki, I was greeted by both Jari and Anna. Jari, visibly frail and wheelchair-bound due to severe osteoporosis, appeared to be in considerable pain. Anna, his primary caregiver, seemed exhausted yet dedicated, managing daily tasks with limited resources.

The apartment was sparsely furnished, lacking essential items such as a proper mattress and adequate heating. Clutter indicated an inability to maintain cleanliness effectively. Jari's medication appeared insufficient for the upcoming week, raising concerns about his ongoing health management. Anna expressed her struggle to balance work commitments with caregiving responsibilities, often resorting to skipping meals and sleep.

Emotionally, both displayed a mix of resilience and despair. Jari's spirits were low due to chronic pain and isolation, while Anna harbored significant stress and guilt over her perceived inadequacy in providing comprehensive care.

**Assessment**

The assessment revealed a critical situation with multiple interconnected issues:

1. **Health Risks:** Jari's inadequate pain management and insufficient medication pose immediate health risks, potentially leading to exacerbated medical conditions or hospitalization.
2. **Living Conditions:** The substandard living environment increases vulnerability to illness, particularly concerning for Jari's compromised immune system due to osteoporosis.
3. **Caregiver Strain:** Anna's overextended role as both caregiver and breadwinner is unsustainable, risking her own health and ability to provide quality care for Jari.
4. **Social Isolation:** Both Jari and Anna experience profound social isolation, exacerbated by their precarious living situation and limited community support networks.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. **Immediate Medical Intervention:** Arrange an urgent consultation with a specialist to address Jari's pain management and medication needs, ensuring a sufficient supply for the foreseeable future.
2. **Housing Support:** Initiate an application for temporary housing or subsidized accommodations that meet accessibility standards, prioritizing a safe and healthier living environment.
3. **Caregiver Relief:** Connect Anna with respite care services to alleviate her caregiving burden, allowing for necessary self-care and work-life balance maintenance.
4. **Community Integration:** Facilitate access to local support groups or social activities designed for individuals in similar situations, fostering a sense of community and reducing isolation.
5. **Follow-up Visit:** Schedule a follow-up visit within one week to monitor progress on implemented recommendations and address any emerging needs or concerns.

This report underscores the urgency of intervention for Jari Pitk채ranta and Anna Koskinen, necessitating swift action across medical, housing, and social support domains to mitigate immediate risks and enhance their quality of life.
