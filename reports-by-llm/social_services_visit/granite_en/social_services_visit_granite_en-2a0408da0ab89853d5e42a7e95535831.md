**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted as part of the ongoing refugee integration support program in Virolahti, Finland. The purpose was to assess the living conditions and support needs of Mikko Koskinen, a single adult with a physical disability who recently arrived in the area. Given the high case severity, the visit aimed to identify immediate risks, evaluate family dynamics (in this case, single-person household), and determine appropriate interventions.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at Mikko's apartment located on Kauppakatu, it was evident that while the dwelling was clean and tidy, accessibility features were minimal due to its older construction. Mikko, who uses a wheelchair, expressed difficulty navigating within the space, particularly in reaching upper cabinets and the bathroom sink. Emotionally, Mikko appeared anxious and overwhelmed, acknowledging language barriers and challenges in understanding local services and procedures.

During our conversation, it was clear that despite his resilience, Mikko struggled with daily tasks such as grocery shopping and accessing healthcare due to mobility limitations and the unfamiliarity with Finnish culture and language. He expressed a strong desire to integrate into the community but felt isolated and unsupported.

**Assessment**

The assessment revealed a high-severity case primarily driven by Mikko's physical disability, language barriers, and lack of local support networks. The immediate risk includes potential health issues arising from inadequate self-care due to physical limitations and the psychological impact of social isolation. Family dynamics are non-existent within this single-person household, increasing vulnerability.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. **Immediate Needs:** Arrange for a home assessment by an occupational therapist to recommend accessibility modifications. Coordinate with local volunteers or community groups to assist with grocery shopping and errands until Mikko gains confidence and language proficiency.

2. **Language Support:** Initiate enrolment in a Finnish-as-a-Second-Language (FIS) course tailored for adults with disabilities, ensuring transportation support is available.

3. **Healthcare Access:** Facilitate an appointment with a healthcare provider who speaks a language Mikko understands, to address any immediate medical concerns and establish ongoing care.

4. **Community Integration:** Connect Mikko with local disability advocacy groups and social activities designed for newcomers to foster a sense of belonging and reduce isolation.

5. **Follow-up Visits:** Schedule bi-weekly visits over the next eight weeks to monitor progress, adjust support as needed, and provide ongoing encouragement and resources.

This report underscores the urgency for tailored, multifaceted interventions to address Mikko's complex needs effectively, ensuring his successful integration into the Virolahti community.
