**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This post-abuse recovery support visit was conducted due to an urgent case involving Aino Mäkelä, an elderly woman residing in Pälkäne, Finland. Ms. Mäkelä has been exhibiting early symptoms of dementia, and there are concerns about her recent history of abuse within the household. The purpose of this visit was to assess her current living conditions, emotional state, and overall well-being, as well as to provide necessary support and resources for her recovery and safety.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at Ms. Mäkelä's residence on Kauppakatu 12, I was greeted by a visibly anxious elderly woman who appeared disoriented and confused. Her living conditions were substandard, with clutter and signs of neglect throughout the apartment. There were no immediate safety hazards, but the general state of disarray raised concerns about her ability to maintain a safe environment independently.

During our conversation, Ms. Mäkelä expressed fear and confusion regarding recent events, mentioning unfamiliar individuals in her home. She struggled to recall specific details due to her early-stage dementia but conveyed a sense of ongoing distress and vulnerability. Her emotional state was fragile, with noticeable signs of anxiety and distress.

**Assessment**

The assessment reveals that Ms. Mäkelä is at immediate risk due to her cognitive decline and recent history of abuse. Her living conditions are inadequate, posing potential health hazards. The absence of support from family or caregivers exacerbates her vulnerability. Given the urgency of the situation, it is crucial to address both her physical safety and psychological well-being promptly.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. **Immediate Safety Measures:** Arrange for a temporary stay at a secure senior care facility to ensure Ms. Mäkelä's immediate safety and provide a stable environment conducive to her recovery.

2. **Medical Evaluation:** Schedule an urgent medical assessment to evaluate the extent of any physical injuries resulting from abuse and to manage her dementia symptoms effectively.

3. **Psychological Support:** Refer Ms. Mäkelä to a specialized counselor experienced in trauma and dementia care to address her emotional needs and provide coping strategies.

4. **Family Involvement:** Initiate contact with any known family members to ascertain their awareness of the situation, offer support, and encourage their participation in Ms. Mäkelä's care plan. If necessary, involve protective services to address any ongoing abuse risks.

5. **Regular Follow-up Visits:** Establish a schedule for bi-weekly visits to monitor progress, adjust interventions as needed, and provide ongoing support to both Ms. Mäkelä and her family or caregivers.

This report underscores the urgent need for comprehensive intervention to safeguard Ms. Mäkelä's well-being and prevent further harm. Immediate action is required to address her physical and emotional vulnerabilities stemming from recent abuse and cognitive decline.
