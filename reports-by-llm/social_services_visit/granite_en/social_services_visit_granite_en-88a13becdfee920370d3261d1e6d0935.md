---

**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This post-abuse recovery support visit was conducted to assess the wellbeing of a single father, Jari Koskinen, and his 10-year-old son, Eemil, following an incident of moderate domestic abuse. The purpose was to evaluate their current living conditions, emotional states, and family dynamics, as well as to provide appropriate support and resources for their ongoing recovery.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at Jari's home, I was greeted by a clean and modestly furnished living space. Jari appeared well-groomed and cooperative during our conversation. Eemil was present but kept a respectful distance, engaging occasionally with educational toys in another room.

Jari expressed remorse for his actions and shared that he had sought counseling through a local men's support group focused on anger management and non-violent communication. He also mentioned participating in parenting classes to improve his relationship with Eemil. Jari demonstrated a willingness to learn and change, emphasizing his commitment to providing a safe environment for his son.

Eemil seemed reserved but appeared physically unharmed. He shared that he enjoys school and has friends, indicating some emotional resilience despite the recent events. Jari reported no signs of ongoing abuse or threats, and both he and Eemil expressed a desire for continued support to address lingering emotional distress.

**Assessment**

The case severity is considered moderate due to the isolated nature of the incident, Jari's acknowledgment of wrongdoing, and his proactive steps towards personal growth and family healing. The living conditions are adequate, and there are no immediate safety concerns for Eemil. However, ongoing emotional support is crucial for both father and son to process the trauma and prevent future incidents.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. Continue bi-weekly home visits to monitor progress and provide ongoing emotional support.
2. Refer Jari and Eemil to a family therapist specializing in post-traumatic stress for children and their caregivers.
3. Encourage Jari's participation in a comprehensive anger management program, building on his current group counseling efforts.
4. Schedule a follow-up visit in four months to reassess the family's situation and adjust support strategies as needed.
5. Maintain open communication with local schools and community resources to ensure Eemil receives additional support if required.

This report will be shared with relevant stakeholders, including Jari's legal representative and the assigned family therapist, to facilitate a coordinated approach in supporting Jari and Eemil through their recovery journey.
