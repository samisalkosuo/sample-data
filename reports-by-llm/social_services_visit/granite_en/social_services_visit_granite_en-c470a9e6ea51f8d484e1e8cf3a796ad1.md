**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted as part of ongoing substance abuse support for the Khan family, who recently relocated from another country to Sund, Finland. The purpose was to assess their integration into the local community, evaluate any potential risks related to substance abuse, and provide necessary resources and guidance.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at the Khan residence, a modest apartment in central Sund, I was greeted by Aisha Khan and her children. Mohammad Khan was absent, working. The living conditions were clean and tidy, with basic furnishings typical of newly settled families. The children appeared healthy and engaged, attending to their homework at the dining table.

Aisha expressed gratitude for the support services available in Finland but mentioned ongoing challenges related to language barriers and cultural differences. She reported no recent substance use but acknowledged past struggles with anxiety, which she managed through prescribed medication from a local healthcare provider. Aisha's emotional state was stable, though she displayed occasional signs of stress, likely due to the pressures of adapting to a new environment and supporting her family.

**Assessment**

The Khan family demonstrates a low-severity case concerning substance abuse, primarily historical rather than current. Aisha's commitment to managing her anxiety through prescribed medication indicates responsible behavior. However, the recent relocation presents unique stressors that could potentially exacerbate mental health issues if not addressed proactively.

Family dynamics appear supportive, with Mohammad actively involved in providing for the household and Aisha focused on her children's well-being and education. There are no immediate risks identified within the home environment.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. Continue regular check-ins to monitor Aisha’s mental health and provide ongoing support, including language classes to ease communication challenges.
   
2. Connect the family with local immigrant support groups to foster a sense of community and shared experiences.

3. Schedule a follow-up visit in four weeks to reassess progress and address any emerging concerns or needs.

4. Encourage Mohammad's participation in Finnish language courses to enhance family communication and integration.

5. Maintain open lines of communication with local healthcare providers to ensure Aisha’s medication adherence and mental health management.

This report reflects a supportive approach, acknowledging the Khan family's resilience while proactively addressing potential vulnerabilities associated with their recent relocation and cultural adaptation.
