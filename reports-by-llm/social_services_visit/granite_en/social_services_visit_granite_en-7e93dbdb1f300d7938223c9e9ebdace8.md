---

**Summary of Visit Purpose:**

This follow-up visit was conducted on 29.09.2024 in response to a school truancy report concerning Marja Pitkäranta, a single mother residing in Teuva with her three children: 12-year-old Anna, 10-year-old Olli, and 7-year-old Eeva. The case severity was deemed low, indicating a need for support rather than immediate intervention.

**Observations During the Visit:**

Upon arrival at Marja's residence, I was greeted by the children who appeared healthy and well-groomed. Marja welcomed me into her modest home, which was clean and organized despite some signs of wear. The children were engaged in their respective activities – Anna studying, Olli playing quietly with toys, and Eeva napping.

Marja expressed concern about her eldest child's recent absenteeism from school, attributing it to Anna's struggle with a new teacher and subject matter. She mentioned feeling overwhelmed managing work and childcare responsibilities alone. Marja's emotional state was calm but revealed underlying stress.

**Assessment:**

The family's living conditions are adequate, though financial constraints are evident. There is no immediate risk to the children's safety or well-being. The truancy appears to stem from Anna's adjustment difficulties rather than neglect or indifference on Marja's part. The low case severity suggests that with appropriate support, the issue can be resolved without further escalation.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up:**

1. **School Collaboration:** Arrange a meeting between Marja, Anna, and her teacher to address concerns and develop strategies for improved engagement in schoolwork.
   
2. **Parental Support Group:** Refer Marja to a local parent support group to share experiences and gain coping strategies for single parenthood.

3. **Financial Assistance:** Connect Marja with social welfare services to explore potential financial aid or employment support programs.

4. **Follow-up Visit:** Schedule a follow-up visit in four weeks to assess progress and adjust interventions as necessary.

This report concludes the findings from the visit to Marja Pitkäranta's household in Teuva on 29.09.2024. Further updates will be provided following the recommended actions and subsequent visits.
