---

**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This safety plan monitoring visit was conducted due to the critical case severity, stemming from a blended family environment experiencing recent custody changes. The purpose was to assess the living conditions, family dynamics, and overall safety of all household members, particularly focusing on potential risks and vulnerabilities arising from these significant life transitions.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at Aino Mäkelä's residence in Joensuu, I was greeted by Aino, her teenage son Leo, and her new partner Marko, along with Marko's young daughter Anna. The household appeared tidy but showed signs of recent upheaval, such as unpacked boxes and a generally disorganized living space.

Aino seemed anxious and overwhelmed by the custody arrangements, expressing concerns about her son Leo's adjustment to the new family dynamics and Marko's occasional volatile behavior. Leo appeared withdrawn and reserved, spending most of the visit in his room. Anna, Marko's daughter, seemed content but was visibly uncomfortable with the tension in the household.

During our conversation, Aino disclosed that Marko had become physically aggressive during an argument about custody-related issues just a week prior, leading to a police intervention and temporary restraining orders. Despite this incident, Marko was present during the visit under supervision.

**Assessment**

The current situation within the Mäkelä household presents significant risks due to recent custody changes, evident tensions, and a history of domestic violence. The emotional distress experienced by Aino and Leo is palpable, with Leo's withdrawn behavior indicating potential psychological impact from these events. Anna, although seemingly resilient, may also be affected by the ongoing instability in her home environment.

The critical case severity underscores the urgent need for intervention to ensure the safety and well-being of all household members, particularly focusing on conflict resolution, stress management, and child protection.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. **Immediate Referral:** Aino and her family require immediate access to counseling services specializing in family dynamics post-separation and custody disputes. This should include individual sessions for Aino and Leo, as well as joint family therapy to address communication and conflict resolution skills.

2. **Domestic Violence Support:** Given the recent incident of domestic violence, it is crucial that Marko receives mandatory counseling focused on anger management and non-violent conflict resolution. Aino should also be provided with resources for victims of domestic abuse, including support groups and legal advice regarding restraining orders.

3. **Child Protection Assessment:** Given Leo's withdrawn behavior and the family’s history of conflict, a comprehensive child protection assessment is recommended to evaluate any potential neglect or emotional harm resulting from the current family dynamics.

4. **Follow-up Visits:** Scheduled follow-up visits are essential to monitor progress, adjust interventions as necessary, and ensure adherence to safety plans. These should occur bi-weekly initially, reducing frequency as stability improves.

5. **Community Resources:** Connect the family with local community resources such as parenting classes, financial counseling (if applicable), and recreational activities to foster a sense of normalcy and support for all members, especially during this challenging transition period.

This report serves as an initial intervention plan. Continuous collaboration with legal advisors, mental health professionals, and other relevant stakeholders is imperative to navigate the complexities of this critical case effectively.
