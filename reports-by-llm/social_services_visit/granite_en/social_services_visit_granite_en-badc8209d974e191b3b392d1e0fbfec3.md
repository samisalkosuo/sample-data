---

**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted to provide substance abuse support and assess the living conditions of Aino Mäkelä, a single mother residing in Kangasniemi with a history of chronic domestic violence. The primary objective was to evaluate her current situation, identify potential risks, and offer appropriate resources for her and her children's well-being.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at Aino Mäkelä's residence, I observed a modest, clean living space with signs of recent renovation efforts. Aino appeared anxious but cooperative during our conversation. She disclosed that her former partner, who struggled with alcohol abuse, had been absent from the home for six months following a protective order.

Aino's two children, 8-year-old Emma and 12-year-old Oskari, were present and engaged in quiet activities. Aino expressed concern about her children's emotional well-being due to past exposure to domestic violence and the ongoing stress of their father's substance abuse issues.

**Assessment**

The case severity is considered moderate due to the history of chronic domestic violence, Aino's former partner's alcohol abuse, and the lingering emotional impact on her children. Although the immediate physical danger has subsided with the protective order, the family continues to face challenges related to substance abuse and its effects on their mental health.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. Refer Aino Mäkelä to a local substance abuse counseling program for support in managing stress and potential triggers related to her former partner's past behavior.
2. Arrange for Emma and Oskari to participate in age-appropriate family therapy sessions to address their emotional needs resulting from the domestic violence exposure.
3. Connect Aino with a parenting support group to foster resilience and coping strategies within her family unit.
4. Schedule a follow-up visit in four weeks to reassess progress, address any emerging concerns, and adjust support services as needed.
