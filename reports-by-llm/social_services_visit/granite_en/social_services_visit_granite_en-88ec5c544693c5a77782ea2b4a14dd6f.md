**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted to assess the suitability of Aino and Jussi Koskinen, an elderly couple residing independently in Pori, Finland, for a proposed youth mentoring program. The assessment aims to evaluate their living conditions, social engagement, and potential needs that could benefit from structured youth support.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at the Koskinen residence, Aino, 78, greeted us warmly, while Jussi, 80, remained seated in his armchair, appearing somewhat withdrawn. Their home was clean and well-maintained, albeit modestly furnished. There were signs of daily activities, such as a half-finished crossword puzzle on the table and a recent newspaper scattered with knitting needles, indicating Aino's hobbies. Jussi seemed content with his routine but appeared to have limited mobility, relying on a walker for movement.

During our conversation, both expressed a desire for more social interaction, noting feelings of isolation despite regular visits from family members who live in distant cities. Aino mentioned her enjoyment of storytelling sessions at the local senior center but highlighted the challenge of transportation due to infrequent bus schedules. Jussi expressed a keen interest in technology but admitted his lack of confidence in using it, which he felt was isolating him further from younger generations, including potential mentors.

**Assessment**

The Koskinens' living conditions are adequate, though their moderate case severity stems primarily from social isolation and a desire for increased engagement with the community, particularly through technology. While they have supportive family ties, the distance exacerbates feelings of loneliness. Jussi's limited mobility and interest in technology present an opportunity for intergenerational learning and bridging the digital divide.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. **Youth Mentoring Program Participation:** Given their openness to interaction and specific needs, the Koskinens are deemed suitable candidates for the youth mentoring program. A local youth group could be paired with them to facilitate technology training sessions, enhancing Jussi's comfort and connectivity while providing Aino with a social outlet.

2. **Transportation Support:** Explore partnerships with local community centers or volunteer drivers to ensure reliable transportation for Aino to senior activities, including storytelling sessions, thereby reducing her isolation.

3. **Follow-up Visits:** Schedule bi-monthly visits to monitor progress, address any emerging concerns, and adjust the support plan as necessary. 

4. **Referral to Digital Literacy Programs:** Refer Jussi to a local digital literacy program tailored for seniors to build his confidence in using technology, potentially fostering new friendships and reducing feelings of isolation.

This report recommends immediate action to address the identified needs of Aino and Jussi Koskinen, aiming to enhance their quality of life through structured mentoring and community integration efforts.
