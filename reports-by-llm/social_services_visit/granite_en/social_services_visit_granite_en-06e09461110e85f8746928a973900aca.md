**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This mental health monitoring visit was conducted due to the high-severity case involving a separated couple, Aino Korhonen and her ex-partner, Jouko Hietala, who share custody of their two minor children. The primary objective was to assess the emotional well-being of all household members, evaluate living conditions, and identify any immediate risks or concerns that may impact the children's safety and development.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at Aino Korhonen's residence, I observed a tense atmosphere between Aino and Jouko. Their interactions were marked by frequent disagreements and raised voices, despite their efforts to maintain a civil demeanor in front of the children. Aino appeared visibly anxious and withdrawn, while Jouko exhibited signs of irritability and frustration.

The living conditions were adequate, with necessary provisions for the family's needs; however, there was evidence of clutter and disorganization, potentially indicating difficulties in managing daily tasks due to emotional distress. The children, aged 8 and 10, seemed aware of their parents' tensions but appeared otherwise healthy and engaged during our brief interaction.

**Assessment**

The high case severity is primarily driven by the parents' unresolved conflicts and apparent mental health struggles, which pose significant risks to the children's emotional stability and well-being. The parents' inability to communicate effectively and manage their emotions constructively suggests a need for immediate intervention to prevent escalation into more severe issues, such as domestic violence or neglect.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. **Individual Therapy Referral:** Both Aino and Jouko should be referred to individual counseling services to address their mental health concerns, improve emotional regulation, and develop healthier coparenting strategies.

2. **Family Therapy:** Initiate family therapy sessions focusing on conflict resolution, communication skills, and creating a stable environment for the children.

3. **Parenting Support Groups:** Encourage participation in parenting support groups to provide Aino and Jouko with peer learning opportunities and additional coping strategies.

4. **Follow-up Visits:** Schedule bi-weekly visits over the next eight weeks to monitor progress, adjust interventions as necessary, and ensure the children's safety and well-being remain prioritized.

5. **Emergency Contact Information:** Provide Aino and Jouko with emergency contact information for crisis support services in case of escalating tensions or mental health crises.

This comprehensive approach aims to stabilize the family dynamics, mitigate risks, and promote a nurturing environment for the children amidst their parents' separation and ongoing mental health challenges.
