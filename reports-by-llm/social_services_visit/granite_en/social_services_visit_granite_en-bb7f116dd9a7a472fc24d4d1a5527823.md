---

**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted to assess Aino Mäkelä's social reintegration needs following a recent hospitalization due to a moderate exacerbation of her chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The purpose was to evaluate the current living conditions, caregiver support, and identify any barriers to Aino's successful return to the community.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival, I was greeted by Aino Mäkelä and her niece, Maria Koskinen, who serves as the primary caregiver. The home appeared clean and organized, with accessible pathways for Aino's wheelchair. Aino seemed content but displayed signs of fatigue, consistent with her recent hospital stay. Maria was attentive and demonstrated a good understanding of Aino's needs, although she expressed concerns about managing Aino's care alongside her full-time employment.

During our conversation, Aino expressed a strong desire to regain her independence and return to community activities, such as attending her local senior center and participating in respiratory therapy sessions. However, she also voiced apprehension about managing daily tasks without additional support. Maria acknowledged the challenges of balancing work and caregiving responsibilities, indicating a need for respite care services.

**Assessment**

Aino's moderate case severity is primarily driven by her physical health condition and the strain placed on her caregiver, Maria. While Aino's emotional state appears stable, her desire for increased independence highlights potential risks related to isolation and lack of adequate support. The current living arrangement, although functional, may not sustainably meet Aino's needs without additional resources.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. Arrange a home health assessment to evaluate Aino's ongoing medical needs and develop a tailored care plan.
2. Connect Maria with local respite care services to alleviate her caregiving burden and ensure Aino receives consistent, high-quality care.
3. Facilitate Aino's reintegration into the community by coordinating transportation to medical appointments and social activities, as well as exploring opportunities for peer support groups focused on COPD management.
4. Schedule a follow-up visit in four weeks to assess progress, address any emerging concerns, and adjust the support plan as necessary.
