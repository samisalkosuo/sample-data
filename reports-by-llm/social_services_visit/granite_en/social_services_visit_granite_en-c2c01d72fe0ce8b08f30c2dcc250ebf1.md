**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This homeless outreach visit was conducted to assess the living conditions, well-being, and support needs of a refugee family residing temporarily at the Konnevesi Shelter. The purpose was to ensure their basic needs are met, identify any potential risks or concerns, and provide appropriate guidance and resources.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival, I was greeted by Aisha Khan, the mother of the family. She appeared calm and cooperative, expressing gratitude for the temporary accommodation provided by the shelter. The family's living quarters were clean and organized, with adequate furniture and personal belongings. Both children were present and engaged in quiet activities, indicating a routine was established.

Aisha reported that her husband, Khalid, is actively seeking employment opportunities and participates in Finnish language classes to improve communication skills. The family has access to meals provided by the shelter and utilizes local community resources for educational support for their children. Aisha expressed concerns about the children's integration into Finnish schools and their limited social interaction with other children.

The emotional state of the family seemed stable, though there was a noticeable longing for permanent housing and a sense of uncertainty regarding their future in Finland.

**Assessment**

Given the current situation, the case severity is classified as low. The family has access to essential needs such as food, shelter, and basic amenities through the temporary accommodation and community support services. However, there are notable concerns regarding the children's educational integration and social development due to limited interaction with peers.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. Facilitate an introduction to local Finnish schools for the children, ensuring they receive necessary support during the transition process. This could involve coordinating with school authorities and possibly providing language tutoring if required.

2. Connect the family with community organizations that offer extracurricular activities or playgroups for children of similar backgrounds to foster social integration.

3. Schedule a follow-up visit in two months to reassess their progress, address any emerging needs, and provide ongoing support as they navigate the complexities of settling into a new country.

4. Encourage Khalid's continued participation in language classes and job-seeking initiatives, offering additional resources if needed to enhance his employment prospects.

This report will be shared with relevant service providers to ensure a coordinated approach in supporting the Khan family during their transition period in Konnevesi, Finland.
