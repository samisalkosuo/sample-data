---

**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This post-abuse recovery support visit was conducted to assess the well-being of Aino Mäkelä, a mother residing in Savonlinna, Finland, and her newborn infant. The purpose was to provide emotional and practical assistance following an incident of moderate severity abuse, ensuring their safety and promoting healing within the household.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at Aino's modest apartment on Kauppakatu, I observed a clean and organized living space, indicating her commitment to maintaining a stable environment for her infant. Aino appeared tired but composed, engaging with her baby in a gentle manner. The newborn seemed healthy and content, demonstrating no signs of distress or neglect.

During our conversation, Aino expressed remorse for the recent incident, acknowledging her struggles with stress and isolation post-partum. She disclosed feeling overwhelmed by the responsibilities of motherhood and the absence of a supportive partner. Her emotional state was guarded yet receptive to assistance.

**Assessment**

The case severity is considered moderate, primarily due to Aino's history of abuse and current challenges in managing stress without adequate external support. While there are no immediate safety concerns for the infant, the risk of recurrence remains, necessitating ongoing monitoring and intervention. Family dynamics are strained, with Aino lacking a robust support network within Savonlinna.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. **Immediate Support:** Arrange for regular check-ins by a community health worker to monitor both Aino's mental health and the infant's development.
2. **Counseling Referral:** Refer Aino to a local therapist specializing in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and parenting support, with sessions scheduled biweekly initially, then transitioning to monthly as her situation stabilizes.
3. **Parenting Classes:** Enroll Aino in a parenting class focused on positive reinforcement techniques and stress management for new mothers, fostering her confidence and capabilities.
4. **Support Groups:** Introduce Aino to a peer support group for women who have experienced abuse, facilitating connection and shared learning opportunities.
5. **Follow-up Visit:** Schedule the next visit in four weeks to reassess progress, adjust interventions as necessary, and continue providing encouragement and resources.

This report underscores the importance of timely and comprehensive support for Aino Mäkelä to ensure her recovery and the secure upbringing of her infant within the Savonlinna community.
