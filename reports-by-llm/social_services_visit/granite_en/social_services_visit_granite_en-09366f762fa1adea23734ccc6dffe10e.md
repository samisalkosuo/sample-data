---

**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This child welfare check was conducted due to concerns regarding the financial stability and potential impact on the well-being of the multi-generational household residing at Kauppakatu 23, Pietarsaari. The visit aimed to assess the living conditions, family dynamics, and emotional state of the household members, particularly focusing on the children's needs and safety.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival, the residence appeared clean and organized, with evidence of ongoing efforts to maintain a comfortable environment despite financial constraints. Aino Mäkelä, the head of the household, was present and cooperative throughout the visit. Her adult children and grandchildren were also in attendance.

The family expressed gratitude for the support services previously provided but highlighted ongoing challenges in meeting basic needs due to unemployment and limited financial resources. The children, aged 10, 14, and 16, appeared healthy and well-cared for, with no immediate signs of neglect or abuse. However, their emotional state revealed subtle indicators of stress related to the family's financial situation.

**Assessment**

The moderate case severity is primarily driven by the household's financial difficulties, which have led to occasional food insecurity and limited access to extracurricular activities for the children. While the living conditions are adequate, the emotional well-being of the children warrants attention due to the stressors associated with their family's economic struggles.

Family dynamics appear supportive, with extended family members contributing to childcare and providing emotional support. However, the pressure of financial instability could potentially escalate if left unaddressed, increasing the risk of neglect or compromising the children's developmental needs.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. **Immediate Support:** Connect the family with local food banks and community resources to alleviate immediate food insecurity concerns.
2. **Financial Counseling:** Refer Aino Mäkelä and her adult children to financial literacy workshops offered by the Pietarsaari Social Services to enhance their ability to manage finances effectively.
3. **Mental Health Support:** Arrange for the children to receive counseling sessions through the local youth mental health service to address stress-related emotional concerns stemming from their family's financial situation.
4. **Follow-up Visit:** Schedule a follow-up visit in three months to reassess the family's situation, evaluate the effectiveness of implemented support measures, and adjust interventions as necessary.

This report underscores the importance of proactive engagement with families facing moderate welfare concerns. By addressing immediate needs and equipping households with tools for long-term stability, we aim to mitigate risks and foster a nurturing environment for children within challenging circumstances.
