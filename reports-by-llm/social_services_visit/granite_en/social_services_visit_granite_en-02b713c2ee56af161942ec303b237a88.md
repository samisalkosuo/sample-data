**Social Services Visit Report**

*Client Name:* Aino Mäkelä
*Address:* Kauppakatu 12, 67100 Kuortane, Finland
*Visit Date:* 19.02.2025
*Visit Type:* Child visitation supervision report
*Case Severity:* Urgent

**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted due to an urgent case involving a child in the care of an adult, Aino Mäkelä, who is living with a severe mental health condition. The purpose was to assess the living conditions, evaluate the adult's capacity to care for the child, and ensure the child's safety and well-being during supervised visitations.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival at Ms. Mäkelä's residence, the living conditions appeared adequate but disorganized, with signs of neglect in household maintenance. Ms. Mäkelä was present and cooperative during the visit. She displayed erratic behavior, including periods of agitation and withdrawal, which are consistent with her known severe mental health condition. The child, a 7-year-old girl named Eeva, was well-groomed but appeared anxious and clingy to Ms. Mäkelä, indicating a strong attachment.

**Assessment**

The assessment reveals that while the immediate environment is not overtly hazardous, Ms. Mäkelä's mental health condition poses significant risks to her ability to provide consistent, stable care for Eeva. The child's anxiety suggests she is acutely aware of her mother's unpredictable behavior, which could impact her emotional and psychological development.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

Given the urgency and potential risks identified, it is recommended that:

1. Ms. Mäkelä be referred for intensive mental health support to stabilize her condition and improve her capacity to care for Eeva.
2. A family therapist be engaged to address the dynamics between Ms. Mäkelä and Eeva, focusing on building resilience in the child and supporting Ms. Mäkelä's parenting skills.
3. Regular supervised visitation continue with increased frequency to monitor progress and ensure Eeva's safety and emotional well-being.
4. A follow-up visit be scheduled within one month to reassess the situation and adjust interventions as necessary.

This report underscores the immediate need for targeted mental health services to address Ms. Mäkelä's condition, thereby mitigating risks to Eeva's development and ensuring her safety.
