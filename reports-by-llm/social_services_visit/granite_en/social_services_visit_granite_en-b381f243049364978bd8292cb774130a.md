---

**Summary of Visit Purpose**

This visit was conducted as a routine newborn and infant safety check due to the recent birth of Ms. Mäkelä's third child. The purpose was to assess the living conditions, parenting skills, and overall family dynamics to ensure the safety and well-being of the newborn and the other two young children.

**Observations During the Visit**

Upon arrival, the home appeared clean and organized, with age-appropriate toys and furniture for the children. Ms. Mäkelä was present and cooperative throughout the visit. She demonstrated basic parenting skills, such as preparing a bottle for the newborn and engaging the older children in age-appropriate activities.

The oldest child, aged 5, was attending school and showed signs of regular school attendance. The 2-year-old appeared healthy and was interacting well with their siblings. The newborn was sleeping soundly in a safe crib, free from loose bedding or soft objects.

Ms. Mäkelä expressed some stress related to managing three young children alone but showed resilience and a strong desire to provide for her family. She mentioned occasional difficulty affording necessary baby supplies and expressed gratitude for any support offered.

**Assessment**

The living conditions are generally satisfactory, with no immediate safety hazards identified. Ms. Mäkelä's parenting skills are adequate, but her emotional well-being and financial stability pose moderate concerns. The single parenthood status and limited social support increase the risk of stress and potential burnout.

**Recommended Actions or Follow-up**

1. Connect Ms. Mäkelä with local parenting support groups to foster a sense of community and provide additional resources.
2. Arrange for a financial counseling session to address budgeting concerns and explore available assistance programs for single parents.
3. Schedule a follow-up visit in four weeks to reassess the family's situation, monitor progress, and offer ongoing support as needed.
4. Provide information on local food banks or community kitchens to alleviate any immediate food insecurity concerns.

This report will be shared with relevant social service agencies to ensure comprehensive support for Ms. Mäkelä and her children.
