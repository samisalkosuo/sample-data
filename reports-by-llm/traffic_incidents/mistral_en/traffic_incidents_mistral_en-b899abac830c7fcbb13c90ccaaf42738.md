Incident Summary:
A multi-vehicle collision occurred on Kauppakatu (Shopping Street) near the intersection with Linnankatu (Castle Street), in the heart of Mustasaari. The incident involved nine vehicles, resulting in minor injuries to several individuals and significant traffic disruption.

Incident Timeline:
1. At approximately 08:35 AM, a white Volvo V60 with Finnish license plate FAB-123X, driven by Mr. Jukka Mäki (45), was traveling southbound on Kauppakatu. Witnesses report that the vehicle was driving at an excessive speed for the conditions.

2. Simultaneously, a red Toyota Corolla with Finnish license plate YZA-987B, driven by Ms. Liisa Koskela (32), was turning left from Linnankatu onto Kauppakatu. The intersection did not have traffic signals or signs indicating a stop at the time of the incident.

3. As Mr. Mäki's Volvo approached the intersection, he failed to notice Ms. Koskela's Corolla and collided with the side of her vehicle. The impact caused a chain reaction involving seven additional vehicles, including a black Mercedes-Benz E-Class (license plate TUV-345S), a grey Ford Focus (license plate LAX-901Z), and a blue Volkswagen Golf (license plate PQR-765T).

4. Emergency services arrived at the scene within 8 minutes, with police officers, firefighters, and paramedics all responding to the incident. The road was closed for approximately two hours while the vehicles were removed and the scene was investigated.

Damage Descriptions:
1. Volvo V60 (FAB-123X): Extensive damage to the front bumper, hood, and passenger side door.
2. Toyota Corolla (YZA-987B): Significant damage to the driver's side, including a collapsed door and shattered windows.
3. Mercedes-Benz E-Class (TUV-345S): Damage to the front bumper, hood, and passenger side fender.
4. Ford Focus (LAX-901Z): Moderate damage to the driver's side, including a dented door and broken mirror.
5. Volkswagen Golf (PQR-765T): Damage to the rear bumper and taillight assembly.

Injuries:
1. Mr. Jukka Mäki sustained minor injuries to his left arm and was transported to Mustasaari Hospital for treatment.
2. Ms. Liisa Koskela complained of neck pain but refused further medical attention at the scene.
3. Two passengers in one of the involved vehicles were also treated for minor injuries at the scene before being released.

Cause:
The primary cause of this incident appears to be excessive speed and failure to yield the right-of-way, as well as the absence of traffic signals or signs at the intersection. The windy conditions may have further complicated visibility for drivers.

Recommendations:
1. Increase enforcement in areas with a history of traffic incidents, particularly during adverse weather conditions.
2. Install traffic signals or signs at intersections where they are currently lacking to improve driver safety.
3. Encourage drivers to adjust their speed according to the prevailing weather and road conditions.
