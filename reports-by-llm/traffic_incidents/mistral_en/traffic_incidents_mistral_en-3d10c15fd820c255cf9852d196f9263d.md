Incident Number: RUO-240705-001

On the night of July 5th, 2024, a traffic incident occurred on Kauppakatu (Shopping Street) near the intersection with Linnankatu (Castle Street), Ruovesi. The incident involved two vehicles: a silver Volvo XC90 (license plate F-XYZ123) driven by Mr. Juhani Sorsa, aged 45, and a black Mercedes E-Class (license plate O-ABC456) driven by Ms. Liisa Mäki, aged 38.

At approximately 23:30, Mr. Sorsa was traveling southbound on Kauppakatu at a speed estimated to be around 60 km/h in mixed snow and rain conditions. Ms. Mäki was approaching the same intersection from Linnankatu, also heading south, with an estimated speed of 50 km/h.

As Mr. Sorsa approached the intersection, he failed to notice that the traffic lights had turned red due to poor visibility caused by the mixed weather conditions. Ms. Mäki, who had a green light, proceeded into the intersection and collided with the driver's side of Mr. Sorsa's Volvo.

Witness statements indicate that both drivers appeared to be unharmed but shocked immediately following the collision. The impact caused significant damage to both vehicles, with the Mercedes sustaining front-end damage and the Volvo having extensive damage to its passenger side.

Emergency services arrived at the scene within 8 minutes of the initial call. Both drivers were assessed by paramedics and found to be physically uninjured but emotionally distressed. The vehicles were towed away for further examination, and the road was cleared by 01:00.

The incident is currently under investigation by local authorities. Preliminary findings suggest that the primary cause of the accident was failure to obey traffic signals due to poor visibility caused by mixed snow and rain conditions.

This report will be updated as more information becomes available.
