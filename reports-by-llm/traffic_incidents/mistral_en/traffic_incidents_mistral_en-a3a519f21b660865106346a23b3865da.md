Location: Valkeakoski, Finland
Municipality: City of Valkeakoski
Incident Number: VK-230822-01

Incident Summary:
A two-vehicle collision occurred on Mäkelänkatu (Mäkelä Street) near the intersection with Kauppakatu (Shopping Street), involving a silver Volvo XC60 (license plate FIN-ABC 123) and a black Toyota Corolla (license plate FIN-DEF 456). The incident took place during mixed snow and rain conditions, which significantly impacted the road surface.

Incident Narrative:
Witness statements indicate that the Volvo XC60, driven by Mr. Jari Mäkelä (age 38, resident of Kauppakatu 21), was traveling southbound on Mäkelänkatu at a moderate speed. Simultaneously, the Toyota Corolla, driven by Ms. Liisa Koskela (age 45, resident of Mäkelänkatu 37), was turning left from Kauppakatu onto Mäkelänkatu, intending to head northbound.

Ms. Koskela reported that she had activated her turn signal and began the maneuver when the Volvo XC60 failed to slow down or adjust its speed accordingly. As a result, the front of the Volvo collided with the driver's side of the Toyota Corolla, causing both vehicles to spin out of control before coming to a stop on the roadway.

Emergency services arrived at the scene within minutes and assessed the condition of all parties involved. Mr. Mäkelä and Ms. Koskela were uninjured but shaken up by the incident. Both drivers provided statements to the investigating officer, who noted that visibility was reduced due to the mixed snow and rain conditions, which may have contributed to the collision.

Damage Assessment:
Upon inspection of the vehicles, it was determined that both the Volvo XC60 and Toyota Corolla sustained significant damage to their front ends, with the Volvo's bumper and grille being crushed against the Toyota's passenger door. The airbags in both vehicles were deployed, but no other passengers were present during the incident.

Road Conditions:
The road surface on Mäkelänkatu was slick due to the mixed snow and rain conditions, which likely played a role in the collision. The city's snowplows had been active throughout the night, but the continuous precipitation had re-frozen into a layer of ice in some areas.

Conclusion:
The incident is currently under investigation by the Valkeakoski Police Department's Traffic Unit. Preliminary findings suggest that the collision may have been caused by reduced visibility and slippery road conditions, as well as an alleged failure by Mr. Mäkelä to adjust his speed or react appropriately to Ms. Koskela's turn signal.

This report will be updated as more information becomes available and the investigation progresses.
