Weather Conditions: Heavy rain

Upon arrival at the scene on Kauppakatu (Shopping Street), near the intersection with Linnankatu (Castle Street), I found a multi-vehicle collision involving nine vehicles. The incident occurred during rush hour, exacerbating traffic congestion in the area.

The first vehicle involved was a silver Volvo XC90 (license plate F-ABC 123) driven by Mr. Jukka Saarinen, 45, of Kauppakatu 24. Witness statements suggest that Mr. Saarinen lost control of his vehicle due to the heavy rain, causing him to swerve into oncoming traffic.

The second vehicle involved was a black Audi Q7 (license plate O-DEF 456) driven by Ms. Liisa Mäki, 38, of Linnankatu 12. Ms. Mäki attempted to avoid the out-of-control Volvo but collided with it, causing a chain reaction involving seven additional vehicles.

The third vehicle involved was a red Toyota RAV4 (license plate G-HIJ 789) driven by Mr. Marko Koskela, 27, of Kauppakatu 36. The fourth vehicle was a blue Ford Focus (license plate J-KLM 901) driven by Ms. Anna Särkkä, 52, of Linnankatu 4.

The fifth vehicle involved was a green Mazda CX-5 (license plate P-NOP 321) driven by Mr. Petri Hämäläinen, 30, of Kauppakatu 18. The sixth vehicle was a white Volkswagen Tiguan (license plate Q-RST 456) driven by Ms. Sanna Virtanen, 29, of Linnankatu 20.

The seventh vehicle involved was a black Mercedes-Benz GLC (license plate U-VWX 789) driven by Mr. Eero Nurmi, 42, of Kauppakatu 5. The eighth vehicle was a silver BMW X3 (license plate Y-ZAB 123) driven by Ms. Minna Lappalainen, 34, of Linnankatu 6.

The ninth and final vehicle involved was a red Subaru Forester (license plate A-BCD 456) driven by Mr. Juhani Korpela, 58, of Kauppakatu 10.

All drivers and passengers were able to exit their vehicles without assistance, but several reported minor injuries. Emergency medical services were called to the scene to assess and treat the injured parties.

The heavy rain made it difficult for emergency responders to navigate the scene, and traffic was diverted around the incident for several hours. The road surface was slick, and skid marks indicated that many vehicles had lost control due to the wet conditions.

The incident is currently under investigation by the Ranua Police Department. Preliminary findings suggest that the heavy rain played a significant role in the collision, and charges may be filed against Mr. Saarinen for reckless driving.

This report will be updated as more information becomes available.
