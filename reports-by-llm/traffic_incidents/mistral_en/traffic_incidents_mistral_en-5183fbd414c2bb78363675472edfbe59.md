 Title: Traffic Incident Report
Date: August 25, 2024
Location: Luoto, Finland
Incident Number: LUO-240825-001

On the morning of August 25, 2024, at approximately 08:37 AM local time, a traffic incident occurred on Kauppakatu (Shopping Street) near the intersection with Mannerheimintie (Mannerheim Avenue), in the heart of Luoto municipality.

The incident involved two vehicles: a silver Volvo XC90 with license plate FIN-ABC 123, driven by Mr. Juhani Särkijärvi, aged 45, and a black Audi Q7 with license plate FIN-DEF 456, driven by Ms. Liisa Mäkelä, aged 38. Both drivers were the sole occupants of their respective vehicles.

According to eyewitness accounts, Mr. Särkijärvi was traveling southbound on Kauppakatu while Ms. Mäkelä was heading east on Mannerheimintie. The weather conditions at the time were wet and slippery, which significantly impacted the road surfaces.

As Mr. Särkijärvi approached the intersection, he failed to notice the traffic light turning from green to yellow, and subsequently to red. In an attempt to make a right turn onto Mannerheimintie, his Volvo slid on the wet pavement, colliding with Ms. Mäkelä's Audi that was proceeding straight through the intersection.

The impact caused extensive damage to both vehicles. The front end of Mr. Särkijärvi's Volvo was severely crumpled, while Ms. Mäkelä's Audi sustained damage to its passenger side and undercarriage. Both drivers were able to exit their vehicles without assistance but reported minor injuries.

Emergency services arrived at the scene promptly and provided first aid to the injured parties before transporting them to the nearest hospital for further evaluation and treatment. The road was closed for approximately two hours while the incident was investigated and cleared.

The traffic lights, road signs, and weather conditions were all found to be functioning correctly at the time of the incident. No charges have been filed as of this report's submission; however, the investigation is ongoing.

This report has been compiled based on eyewitness accounts, physical evidence from the scene, and interviews with the drivers involved. Further updates will be provided as the investigation progresses.
