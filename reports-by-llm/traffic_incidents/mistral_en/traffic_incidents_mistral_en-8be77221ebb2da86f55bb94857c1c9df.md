 Title: Traffic Incident Report - Humppila, Finland - 23.01.2025, 23:47 Hours

On the night of January 23rd, 2025, at approximately 23:47 hours, a multi-vehicle collision occurred on Kauppakatu (Shopping Street) in Humppila, Finland. The incident involved eleven vehicles, resulting in extensive damage and minor injuries to several individuals.

The sequence of events began when Mr. Jukka Lehto, driving a 2035 Tesla Model X with license plate F-ABC 123, lost control of his vehicle due to wet and slippery road conditions near the intersection with Mannerheimintie (Mannerheim Road). Witnesses report that Mr. Lehto's vehicle skidded sideways across the road, blocking the path for oncoming traffic.

In an attempt to avoid a collision, Ms. Liisa Mäki, driving a 2034 Volvo XC90 with license plate O-DEF 456, swerved to the right but was unable to stop in time and collided with Mr. Lehto's vehicle. The impact caused a chain reaction involving nine additional vehicles, including a 2033 Ford Transit van (license plate K-GHI 789) driven by Mr. Eero Saari, who was en route to deliver pizzas from Pizza Paradise at 12 Mannerheimintie.

Emergency services arrived on the scene within minutes and found several individuals requiring medical attention. Mr. Lehto and Ms. Mäki sustained minor injuries, while Mr. Saari was unharmed but his van suffered significant damage. Other drivers and passengers involved in the incident were not reported to have any serious injuries.

The road was closed for approximately three hours while emergency services attended to the scene and police conducted an initial investigation. The wet and slippery conditions, combined with the high volume of traffic at that time, are believed to have contributed to the severity of the collision.

This incident serves as a reminder to all drivers to exercise caution, especially during adverse weather conditions. Road safety is paramount, and we urge everyone to drive responsibly to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.

Investigation into the accident continues, with further details to be released as they become available.
