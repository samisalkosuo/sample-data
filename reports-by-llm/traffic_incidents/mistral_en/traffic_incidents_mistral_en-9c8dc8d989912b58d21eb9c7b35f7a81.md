Upon arrival at the scene, officers found two vehicles involved in a collision on Kauppakatu (Shopping Street), near the intersection with Linnankatu (Castle Street). The incident occurred approximately 50 meters south of the Alavus City Library.

Vehicle 1: A silver 2018 Volvo XC60, license plate F-XYZ 123, driven by Mr. Jukka Saarinen, age 45, and carrying one passenger, Ms. Liisa Mäki, age 42. The vehicle sustained significant front-end damage, with the bumper and grille severely crushed.

Vehicle 2: A black 2017 Toyota Corolla, license plate O-ABC 987, driven by Ms. Sanna Koskela, age 34, and carrying no passengers at the time of the incident. The vehicle's front left fender was damaged, with noticeable scrapes along the side.

According to eyewitness accounts, both vehicles were traveling south on Kauppakatu when the incident occurred. Ms. Koskela reportedly lost control of her Toyota Corolla due to icy road conditions, causing her vehicle to slide diagonally across the intersection and collide with Mr. Saarinen's Volvo XC60.

The first responding officer arrived at the scene at 19:42 and found both drivers uninjured but shaken. Ms. Mäki was transported to Alavus Central Hospital for precautionary examination due to complaints of neck pain. The vehicles were towed away from the scene at 20:35, with traffic returning to normal by 21:00.

The incident is currently under investigation, with a focus on determining whether any traffic laws were violated and assessing the role of icy road conditions in the collision. The report will be updated as more information becomes available.
