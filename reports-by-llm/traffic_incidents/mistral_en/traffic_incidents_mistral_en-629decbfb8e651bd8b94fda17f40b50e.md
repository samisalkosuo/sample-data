Incident Number: KAV-230302-001

On the night of March 2nd, 2023, at approximately 23:45 local time, a traffic incident occurred on Mäntyharju Street (B97) near the intersection with Kylänkyläntie (C18), in Kaavi municipality. The incident involved two vehicles: a silver Toyota Corolla (license plate F-XYZ 123) driven by Mr. Jukka Saarinen, aged 45, and a black Volkswagen Golf (license plate O-ABC 987) driven by Ms. Liisa Mäki, aged 38.

According to eyewitness accounts, both vehicles were traveling in the same direction when the incident occurred. Mr. Saarinen was approaching the intersection from Mäntyharju Street, while Ms. Mäki was approximately 100 meters behind him. The road conditions were snowy and slippery due to fresh snowfall, reducing visibility and traction for the drivers.

As Mr. Saarinen approached the intersection, he lost control of his vehicle on the icy surface, causing it to spin out of control and slide sideways into the path of Ms. Mäki's approaching Volkswagen Golf. Despite attempting to brake, Ms. Mäki was unable to avoid colliding with the spinning Toyota Corolla.

The impact caused significant damage to both vehicles. The front-end of Mr. Saarinen's Toyota sustained heavy damage, with the bumper and grille being crushed against the radiator. The Volkswagen Golf suffered damage to its passenger side, with the door and fender being dented and scratched.

Both drivers and their passengers (Ms. Saarinen, aged 42, and Mr. Mäki, aged 10) were uninjured in the incident. However, both vehicles were rendered inoperable due to the extent of the damage. The scene was secured by local law enforcement, and a tow truck was called to remove the damaged vehicles.

The incident is currently under investigation by the Kaavi Police Department. Witness statements are being collected, and the road conditions will be reviewed as part of the ongoing investigation. No charges have been filed at this time.
