Time of Occurrence: 08:37 (morning)
Weather Conditions: Windy with gusts

Upon arrival at the scene, I found two vehicles involved in a collision on Kauppakatu (Shopping Street), near the intersection with Torikatu (Market Street). The incident occurred approximately 200 meters west of the Rauma Market Square.

Vehicle 1: A silver Volvo V60 with Finnish license plate FAB-123M, driven by Mr. Juhani Mäki (45 years old) and carrying one passenger, Ms. Sanna Niemi (38 years old). The vehicle sustained significant front-end damage, with the bumper and grille crushed against the radiator.

Vehicle 2: A red Toyota Corolla with Finnish license plate LKO-987N, driven by Ms. Liisa Koskela (32 years old) and carrying no passengers. The vehicle's front left fender was crumpled, and the airbags had deployed.

According to eyewitness accounts, both vehicles were traveling westbound on Kauppakatu when a sudden gust of wind caused Mr. Mäki's Volvo to swerve into the eastbound lane, colliding with Ms. Koskela's Corolla. The impact occurred near the intersection, causing both vehicles to spin out and come to rest in the middle of the road.

The first witness, Mr. Eero Saari (58 years old), a local shop owner, reported that he saw the Volvo swerve into the oncoming lane just before the collision. Another witness, Ms. Marja-Liisa Hämäläinen (62 years old), who was walking her dog at the time, confirmed Mr. Saari's account and added that the wind had been particularly strong at the moment of the accident.

Both drivers and the passenger in Vehicle 1 were transported to Rauma Central Hospital for precautionary checks. Preliminary reports indicate no life-threatening injuries. Ms. Koskela declined medical attention on the scene but was advised to seek a checkup at her earliest convenience.

The road was closed for approximately two hours while the vehicles were removed and the scene was investigated. The incident is currently under investigation, with a focus on the impact of the windy conditions on the drivers' ability to maintain control of their vehicles.

This report will be updated as more information becomes available.
