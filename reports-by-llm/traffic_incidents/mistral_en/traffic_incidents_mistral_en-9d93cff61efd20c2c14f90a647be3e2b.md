 Title: Traffic Incident Report

Date: July 15, 2024
Location: Kemiönsaari, Finland
Incident Number: TI-240715-001

On the night of July 15, 2024, at approximately 23:37 hours, a multiple-vehicle collision occurred on Vuosaarenkatu, near the intersection with Kauppakatu. The incident involved three vehicles and resulted in minor injuries to several individuals.

The following is a detailed account of the events leading up to the accident:

1. Mr. Jukka Saarinen (Driver A), operating a 2023 Volvo XC90 with license plate F-ABC 123, was traveling southbound on Vuosaarenkatu at an estimated speed of 60 km/h.

2. Ms. Liisa Mäki (Driver B), driving a 2024 Toyota Corolla with license plate F-DEF 456, was approaching the same intersection from Kauppakatu, intending to turn left onto Vuosaarenkatu.

3. Mr. Eero Lappalainen (Driver C), in a 2022 Ford Focus with license plate F-GHI 789, was stationary at the same intersection due to a red traffic light. Upon observing that Ms. Mäki's vehicle had begun its left turn, he proceeded to move forward, intending to pass through the intersection.

As Driver B began her left turn, she failed to notice that Driver C had started moving. Consequently, Driver C collided with the left side of Driver B's Corolla. The impact caused Driver B to lose control of her vehicle, which subsequently struck a street sign and spun out into the opposite lane, where it was struck by Driver A's Volvo XC90.

Witness statements suggest that the wet and slippery road conditions may have contributed to the accident, as several witnesses reported seeing other vehicles hydroplane on the same stretch of road during the incident. The weather at the time was overcast with occasional rain showers, creating a slick surface on the roads.

Upon arrival, emergency services found all parties involved in the collision conscious and responsive. Driver A and Driver C sustained minor injuries, while Driver B reported no physical harm but appeared shaken. All three were transported to Kemiönsaari Hospital for further evaluation and treatment.

The vehicles involved in the incident sustained significant damage. Driver A's Volvo XC90 suffered front-end damage, with the left headlight and bumper being destroyed upon impact with Driver B's Corolla. Driver B's Corolla had extensive damage to its left side, including a crushed door and wheel, while Driver C's Ford Focus sustained front-end damage as well, with the hood being pushed in from the collision with both other vehicles.

The Kemiönsaari Police Department is currently investigating the incident, focusing on potential factors such as visibility, road conditions, and driver error. The investigation will also include an analysis of any available dashcam footage from nearby vehicles to further determine the sequence of events leading up to the collision.

This report will be updated as more information becomes available.
