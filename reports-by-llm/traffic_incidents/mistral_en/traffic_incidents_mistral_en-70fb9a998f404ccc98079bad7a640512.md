5. Vehicle 5 (Witness: Mr. Eero Lappalainen, no license plate) - A 2022 Nissan Qashqai

Sequence of Events:
1. At approximately 08:10, Ms. Koskela was driving westbound on Kauppakatu Street in the left lane. Mr. Saarinen was traveling eastbound in the right lane, approaching the intersection with Mannerheimintie.
2. As both drivers approached the intersection, a sudden mixed snow and rain shower obscured visibility for approximately 30 seconds.
3. In the adverse weather conditions, Ms. Koskela failed to stop at the red light and collided with Mr. Saarinen's vehicle, causing it to spin out of control and block the eastbound lanes.
4. Mr. M채ki, traveling behind Mr. Saarinen, was unable to stop in time and rear-ended his vehicle, pushing it further into the intersection.
5. Ms. Nurmi, who was also traveling westbound but in the right lane, swerved to avoid the collision but clipped the rear of Mr. M채ki's vehicle, causing minor damage.
6. Mr. Lappalainen, a witness driving behind Ms. Nurmi, stopped his vehicle and called emergency services to report the incident.
7. Emergency responders arrived at the scene within 5 minutes and assessed the injuries of those involved. Minor injuries were reported, with no one requiring hospitalization.
8. The road was closed for approximately 1 hour while the vehicles were towed away and the scene was cleared. Traffic was diverted through side streets during this time.

Weather and Road Conditions:
The incident occurred in mixed snow and rain conditions, which significantly reduced visibility and made road surfaces slippery. The adverse weather conditions are believed to have contributed to the collision. Road salt had been applied earlier in the day but was not sufficient to prevent the accident due to the rapid onset of the storm.

Damage Descriptions:
1. Vehicle 1 (Mr. Saarinen's Toyota Corolla) sustained significant front-end damage, with a collapsed passenger side airbag and a damaged bumper. The vehicle was towed away from the scene.
2. Vehicle 2 (Ms. Koskela's Volkswagen Golf) had moderate front-end damage, including a cracked windshield and a damaged bumper. The vehicle was also towed away from the scene.
3. Vehicle 3 (Mr. M채ki's Ford Focus) suffered minor rear-end damage, with a dented bumper and a scratched trunk. The vehicle was able to be driven away from the scene after being inspected by a mechanic.
4. Vehicle 4 (Ms. Nurmi's Hyundai i30) had only minor scrapes on the rear bumper, which did not appear to have affected its drivability.
5. No damage was reported for Vehicle 5 (Mr. Lappalainen's Nissan Qashqai).

This report is based on eyewitness accounts and the initial investigation by local law enforcement. Further analysis will be conducted to determine the exact cause of the collision and any potential contributing factors, such as vehicle maintenance or road conditions.
