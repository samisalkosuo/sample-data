 Title: Traffic Incident Report
Date: March 23, 2023
Location: Hailuoto, Finland
Incident Number: 230323-HAI-001

On the evening of March 23, 2023, at approximately 19:45 local time, a traffic incident occurred on Kauppakatu (Shopping Street) near the intersection with Linnankatu (Castle Street), in Hailuoto. The incident involved two vehicles: a silver Toyota Corolla (license plate F-ABC 123) driven by Mr. Jukka Saarinen, aged 45, and a black Volkswagen Golf (license plate O-DEF 456) driven by Ms. Liisa Mäki, aged 38.

According to eyewitness accounts, both vehicles were traveling in opposite directions when the incident occurred. Mr. Saarinen was approaching the intersection from Kauppakatu, while Ms. Mäki was coming from Linnankatu. The weather conditions at the time were unfavorable, with a severe thunderstorm causing heavy rain and reduced visibility.

As Mr. Saarinen approached the intersection, he reportedly failed to notice that the traffic light had turned red due to the poor visibility caused by the storm. Ms. Mäki, who had the right of way, continued through the intersection, but due to the heavy rain, she was unable to stop in time and collided with Mr. Saarinen's vehicle.

The impact caused significant damage to both vehicles. The front end of Ms. Mäki's Volkswagen Golf was severely crumpled, while Mr. Saarinen's Toyota Corolla sustained damage to its passenger side. Both drivers and their passengers—Ms. Saarinen, aged 42, and Mr. Mäki, aged 10—were uninjured but shaken up by the incident.

Emergency services arrived at the scene promptly and assessed the situation. The vehicles were towed away for further inspection and potential repairs. The road was closed for approximately two hours to allow for the cleanup of debris and the investigation into the cause of the accident.

The incident is currently under investigation by local authorities, with a focus on determining whether Mr. Saarinen's failure to notice the red traffic light was due to the adverse weather conditions or other factors. Witness statements are being collected, and further investigations will be conducted as necessary.

This report is preliminary and subject to change as the investigation continues. Updates will be provided as more information becomes available.
