 Title: Traffic Incident Report - 27.12.2022, Suonenjoki, Finland

On the evening of December 27th, 2022, at approximately 19:35 local time, a multi-vehicle collision occurred on Kauppakatu (Shopping Street), near the intersection with Linnankatu (Castle Street) in Suonenjoki, Finland. The incident involved ten vehicles, resulting in minor injuries to several individuals and significant traffic disruption.

The following is a detailed account of the events leading up to the collision:

1. Initial Incident (19:35): A white Volvo V60 with Finnish license plate FAB 123X, driven by Mr. Juhani Mäki (45), was traveling southbound on Kauppakatu at an estimated speed of 60 km/h. Simultaneously, a black Mercedes-Benz C-Class with the license plate YZO 987W, driven by Ms. Sanna Koskela (32), was turning left from Linnankatu onto Kauppakatu.

2. Collision (19:35): Due to heavy traffic and poor visibility due to the setting sun, Mr. Mäki failed to notice Ms. Koskela's turn signal and collided with her Mercedes-Benz. The impact caused a chain reaction involving eight additional vehicles, including a red Toyota Corolla (license plate TYH 456V), a blue Ford Focus (license plate LKO 234Z), and a grey Opel Astra (license plate PQR 890X).

3. Aftermath (19:35 - 19:50): Emergency services, including the Suonenjoki Police Department and local ambulance service, were dispatched to the scene. The road was closed in both directions, causing significant traffic congestion throughout the city center.

4. Injuries and Damage (19:35 - 20:30): Several individuals sustained minor injuries as a result of the collision. Mr. Mäki and Ms. Koskela were transported to Suonenjoki Central Hospital for treatment. The other drivers and passengers involved in the incident were assessed at the scene and released with no reported injuries.

The vehicles involved in the collision sustained varying degrees of damage, ranging from minor scratches to extensive structural damage. Mr. Mäki's Volvo V60 was towed away with a severely damaged front bumper and hood, while Ms. Koskela's Mercedes-Benz C-Class required significant repairs to its front end and left side.

The clear and sunny weather conditions contributed to the reduced visibility for drivers, making it difficult to navigate the busy city streets during rush hour. The road surface was dry and in good condition, but the setting sun created glare that may have played a role in the initial collision.

Witnesses at the scene reported seeing Mr. Mäki using his mobile phone just before the accident occurred. Police are investigating whether this distraction contributed to the incident. The investigation is ongoing, and further updates will be provided as information becomes available.

This report has been compiled based on eyewitness accounts, police reports, and on-scene observations. It serves as a record of the events that transpired on December 27th, 2022, in Suonenjoki, Finland.
