Upon arrival at the scene, I found a multi-vehicle collision on Kauppakatu (Shop Street), near the intersection with Linnankatu (Castle Street). The incident involved five vehicles, as follows:

1. Vehicle 1 - A silver Volvo XC90 (license plate F-ABC 123) driven by Mr. Jukka Saarinen, age 45, of Kauppakatu 21. Mr. Saarinen was traveling southbound on Kauppakatu when the incident occurred.

2. Vehicle 2 - A black Mercedes-Benz C-Class (license plate F-DEF 456) driven by Ms. Liisa Mäki, age 38, of Linnankatu 17. Ms. Mäki was turning left from Linnankatu onto Kauppakatu when the incident occurred.

3. Vehicle 3 - A red Toyota Corolla (license plate F-GHI 789) driven by Mr. Markku Koskela, age 25, of Kauppakatu 34. Mr. Koskela was following Ms. Mäki's Mercedes-Benz and collided with it due to the slippery road conditions.

4. Vehicle 4 - A blue Ford Focus (license plate F-JKL 012) driven by Ms. Anna Lehto, age 52, of Kauppakatu 19. Ms. Lehto was traveling northbound on Kauppakatu and collided with Mr. Koskela's Toyota due to the chain reaction caused by the initial collision.

5. Vehicle 5 - A green Volkswagen Golf (license plate F-MNO 345) driven by Mr. Petri Hämäläinen, age 28, of Linnankatu 27. Mr. Hämäläinen was traveling southbound on Kauppakatu and collided with Ms. Lehto's Ford Focus due to the debris and blocked roadway caused by the initial collision.

Upon assessing the scene, it appeared that all vehicles sustained significant damage, with Mr. Saarinen's Volvo being the most severely damaged due to its initial impact with the median. All drivers and passengers involved in the incident were uninjured but shaken up.

Witnesses at the scene reported seeing Ms. Mäki attempting to make a left turn onto Kauppakatu from Linnankatu, when her vehicle began to slide on the wet and slippery road surface. Mr. Koskela was unable to stop in time and collided with her Mercedes-Benz, causing a chain reaction involving the other three vehicles.

The incident caused significant traffic disruptions for approximately one hour while emergency services attended to the scene and cleared the debris. The roadway was closed during this time, and detours were put in place to divert traffic away from the area.

This report will be forwarded to the relevant authorities for further investigation and potential charges against any parties involved in the incident.
