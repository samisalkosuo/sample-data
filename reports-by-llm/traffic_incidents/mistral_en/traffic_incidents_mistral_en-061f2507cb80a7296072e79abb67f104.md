2. Ms. Anna Miettinen (Address: Valkeakoski, Linnankatu 78, Apartment 1A) was driving east on Linnankatu Street and stopped at the intersection due to the heavy rain and visibility issues before witnessing the collision.

Timeline of Events:
- At approximately 23:10, Mr. Mäki (Vehicle 1) was traveling south on Kauppakatu Street at a speed estimated between 60-70 km/h.
- Ms. Koskela (Vehicle 2) was heading east on Linnankatu Street at an estimated speed of 50 km/h, approaching the intersection with Kauppakatu Street.

- As Mr. Saarinen turned left, he lost visibility due to the heavy rain and thunderstorm, causing him to collide with Ms. Koskela's vehicle (Vehicle 2). The impact caused both vehicles to spin out of control.
- In the chaos, Ms. Nurmi (Vehicle 4) was unable to stop in time and crashed into the rear of Mr. Saarinen's vehicle.
- The collision resulted in significant damage to all four vehicles, with Vehicles 1 and 2 sustaining the most severe damage due to their initial impact.

Weather and Road Conditions:
The incident occurred during a thunderstorm, which significantly reduced visibility on the roads. Heavy rainfall made it difficult for drivers to see other vehicles and road signs, contributing to the collision. The road surfaces were wet and slippery, further complicating driving conditions.

Investigation and Next Steps:
The investigation is ongoing, with police officers collecting statements from witnesses and analyzing the scene. Preliminary findings suggest that the heavy rain and reduced visibility played a significant role in the accident. No charges have been filed at this time, but the investigation will continue to determine any potential contributing factors or violations of traffic laws.

Traffic disruptions were extensive due to the collision, with Kauppakatu Street being closed for several hours while emergency services attended to the scene and tow trucks removed the damaged vehicles. Diversions were put in place to redirect traffic away from the area during this time.
