 Title: Traffic Incident Report
Date: February 15, 2025
Location: Muonio, Finland
Incident Number: MUO-250215-003

On the evening of February 15, 2025, at approximately 19:37 hours, a multiple vehicle collision occurred on Käsivarsi Road (State Road 4), near the intersection with Pallas Street, in Muonio. The incident involved three vehicles: a silver Toyota Corolla (license plate FIN-ABC 123), a red Volkswagen Golf (FIN-DEF 456), and a black Volvo XC90 (FIN-GHI 789).

Witness statements suggest that the incident began when the driver of the Toyota Corolla, Mr. Jari Mäki (age 35, resident of Käsivarsi Road 21), was traveling southbound on Käsivarsi Road at an estimated speed of 60 km/h. The driver of the Volkswagen Golf, Ms. Liisa Koskela (age 42, resident of Pallas Street 37), was approaching the intersection from Pallas Street, also heading southbound.

According to eyewitness accounts, a sudden gust of wind caused Ms. Koskela's vehicle to lose control as she entered the intersection. The Volkswagen Golf veered into the path of Mr. Mäki's Toyota Corolla, colliding with it broadside. The impact caused both vehicles to spin out of control and skid across the road before coming to a halt.

In the aftermath of the initial collision, the black Volvo XC90, driven by Mr. Markku Saari (age 52, resident of Käsivarsi Road 15), was unable to stop in time due to the debris and skidding vehicles blocking his path. The Volvo collided with the rear of the Toyota Corolla, causing further damage to all three vehicles.

Emergency services arrived at the scene within minutes, with police officers, firefighters, and paramedics attending to the injured parties and assessing the extent of the damage. Mr. Mäki and Ms. Koskela sustained minor injuries and were transported to the local hospital for treatment. Mr. Saari was unharmed in the incident.

The road was closed for approximately two hours while the scene was cleared, debris was removed, and investigations into the cause of the accident were initiated. The weather conditions at the time of the incident were windy with gusts, which likely contributed to Ms. Koskela's loss of control. Road surfaces were wet due to recent snowfall, further complicating driving conditions.

The vehicles involved in the collision sustained significant damage. Mr. Mäki's Toyota Corolla had extensive front-end damage, with the driver's side door being crushed as a result of the impact. Ms. Koskela's Volkswagen Golf suffered similar damage to its passenger side, while Mr. Saari's Volvo XC90 sustained minor rear-end damage due to the collision.

This report will be updated as further information becomes available and the investigation progresses.
