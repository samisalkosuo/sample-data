Incident Number: 24-00036

On the evening of January 10th, 2024, at approximately 19:37 hours, a multiple vehicle collision occurred on Vuokkijärventie (Highway 5), near the intersection with Kylpylänkatu (Street of Baths). The incident involved three vehicles and resulted in minor injuries to several individuals.

The following is a detailed account of the events leading up to the collision:

1. Vehicle 1, a silver 2023 Volvo XC60 with license plate FIN-ABC 123, was traveling southbound on Vuokkijärventie at an estimated speed of 70 km/h. The driver, Mr. Juhani Mäki (45 years old), and his passenger, Ms. Sanna Niemi (38 years old), were en route to their home in Hankasalmi after a day of shopping in Jyväskylä.

2. Approximately 100 meters north of the intersection, Vehicle 2, a black 2022 Toyota Corolla with license plate FIN-DEF 456, was waiting at a red traffic light. The driver, Mr. Markku Koskela (32 years old), was turning left onto Kylpylänkatu to reach his workplace, the Hankasalmi Hospital.

3. As Vehicle 1 approached the intersection, the mixed snow and rain conditions made visibility poor, reducing the driver's ability to react appropriately. Unable to stop in time, Mr. Mäki's Volvo collided with the rear of Mr. Koskela's Toyota Corolla.

4. The impact caused Vehicle 2 to spin out of control and collide with a nearby street sign, snapping it off at its base. Simultaneously, Vehicle 1 veered off the road onto the grassy median, where it came to a halt after striking a tree.

5. A witness, Ms. Liisa Lappalainen (58 years old), who was walking her dog near the scene, immediately called emergency services and provided assistance to those involved in the collision.

6. Upon arrival, emergency responders found that Mr. Mäki and Ms. Niemi had sustained minor injuries, while Mr. Koskela remained unharmed. All parties were transported to Hankasalmi Hospital for further evaluation and treatment.

7. The road was closed for approximately two hours while the scene was cleared and an investigation commenced. The vehicles involved in the collision were towed away, with Vehicle 1 sustaining significant front-end damage and Vehicle 2 displaying damage to its rear bumper and left side.

8. The incident remains under investigation by local authorities, with a focus on determining whether weather conditions played a role in the accident. Preliminary findings suggest that poor visibility due to mixed snow and rain may have contributed to the collision.

This report is submitted for the record and will be forwarded to the appropriate departments for further review and analysis.
