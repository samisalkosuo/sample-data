 Traffic Incident Report

Date: October 10, 2023
Location: Nurmijärvi, Finland
Incident Number: NJR-231010-001

On the day of October 10, 2023, at approximately 14:37 hours, a traffic incident occurred on Mäkelänkatu, a major road in Nurmijärvi. The incident involved two vehicles: a silver Volvo V60 with license plate F-XYZ 123 and a black Audi Q5 with license plate O-ABC 456.

Witness accounts suggest that the Volvo, driven by Mr. Jukka Koskela (age 42, resident of Mäkelänkatu 7), was traveling southbound on Mäkelänkatu at a moderate speed. Simultaneously, the Audi, driven by Ms. Liisa Saarinen (age 35, resident of Kauppakatu 12), was approaching from the opposite direction.

As both vehicles approached the intersection with Töölönkatu, the road surface became increasingly slippery due to icy conditions. The Volvo, attempting to maintain control on the slick roads, lost traction and began to slide sideways across the lanes.

Ms. Saarinen, who was unable to react in time due to the suddenness of the incident, collided with the sliding Volvo. The impact caused both vehicles to spin out of control, with the Audi coming to a stop on the northbound lane of Mäkelänkatu, and the Volvo coming to rest partially on the sidewalk.

Emergency services arrived at the scene within minutes, and both drivers were assessed for injuries. Mr. Koskela sustained minor cuts and bruises, while Ms. Saarinen was unharmed. Both drivers were subsequently transported to the nearest hospital for further evaluation.

The road was closed for approximately two hours while the vehicles were removed and the scene was cleared. The incident serves as a reminder of the importance of driving cautiously during adverse weather conditions, particularly on icy roads.

Investigation into the incident is ongoing, with a focus on determining the exact cause of the Volvo's loss of control. This report will be updated as more information becomes available.
