Location: Alajärvi, Finland
Incident Number: TI-230515-001

On the day of May 15th, 2023, at approximately 14:37 hours, a traffic incident occurred on Kauppakatu (Shopping Street) near the intersection with Linnankatu (Castle Street), in the heart of Alajärvi. The incident involved three vehicles and resulted in minor injuries to two individuals.

The following is a detailed account of the events leading up to the incident:

14:35 hours - A blue 2022 Volvo XC60 with Finnish license plate FAB-123X, driven by Mr. Juhani Mäki (age 45) and carrying one passenger, Ms. Sanna Niemi (age 42), was traveling southbound on Kauppakatu at a speed estimated to be within the posted 50 km/h limit.

14:36 hours - A red 2018 Toyota Corolla with Finnish license plate LKO-987Y, driven by Ms. Liisa Koskela (age 38) and carrying one passenger, Mr. Eero Saari (age 40), was traveling eastbound on Linnankatu at a speed estimated to be within the posted 60 km/h limit.

14:37 hours - As Ms. Koskela approached the intersection with Kauppakatu, she failed to observe the stop sign due to overcast weather conditions that reduced visibility and obscured her view of oncoming traffic. The Toyota Corolla proceeded into the intersection, colliding with the Volvo XC60 as it was passing through the intersection.

14:38 hours - A third vehicle, a black 2021 Mercedes-Benz C-Class with Finnish license plate SJK-345Z, driven by Mr. Marko Hämäläinen (age 35), was traveling northbound on Kauppakatu and was unable to stop in time to avoid the collision. The Mercedes-Benz collided with the rear of the Volvo XC60, causing a chain reaction that involved all three vehicles.

14:39 hours - Emergency services were notified immediately following the incident, and police officers, firefighters, and paramedics arrived on the scene within minutes. The injured parties were treated at the scene before being transported to Alajärvi Hospital for further evaluation and treatment. No life-threatening injuries were reported.

14:50 hours - The road was closed for approximately two hours while the vehicles were removed, the scene was cleared, and an investigation into the incident was initiated. The cause of the collision is believed to be due to the failure of Ms. Koskela to stop at the designated stop sign, which may have been exacerbated by overcast weather conditions that reduced visibility.

The vehicles involved in the incident sustained significant damage, with the Volvo XC60 and Toyota Corolla requiring tow trucks for removal from the scene. The Mercedes-Benz C-Class was able to be driven away under its own power after minor repairs were made on site.

This report is preliminary in nature and will be updated as more information becomes available during the ongoing investigation. All parties involved have been contacted and are cooperating fully with the authorities.
