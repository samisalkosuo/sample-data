Incident Description:

On March 21, 2025, at approximately 08:47 AM, a traffic incident occurred on Main Road 6 in Hartola, Finland. The incident involved two vehicles: a silver 2023 Volvo XC90 (license plate F-ABC 123) driven by Mr. Jukka Saarinen, and a black 2024 Toyota Corolla Hybrid (license plate O-DEF 456) driven by Ms. Liisa Koskela.

According to eyewitness accounts, both vehicles were traveling in the same direction when strong gusts of wind caused Mr. Saarinen's Volvo to swerve into the oncoming lane. The Corolla, unable to avoid a collision due to the reduced visibility and slippery road conditions, collided with the driver's side of the Volvo near the intersection of Main Road 6 and Kylpyläntie (address: 48720 Hartola).

Upon arrival, emergency services found both drivers conscious but shaken. Mr. Saarinen sustained minor injuries to his arm, while Ms. Koskela reported no immediate injuries. Both vehicles suffered significant damage to the front ends and were towed from the scene.

Witness statements suggest that neither driver appeared to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs. The incident is currently under investigation by local authorities to determine the exact cause and any contributing factors.

This report will be updated as more information becomes available.
