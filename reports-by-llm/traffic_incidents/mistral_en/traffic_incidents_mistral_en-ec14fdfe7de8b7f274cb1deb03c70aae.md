On the day of April 11, 2024, at approximately 14:36 hours, a traffic incident occurred on Kauppakatu (Shopping Street) near the intersection with Mannerheimintie (Mannerheim Avenue), in the heart of Ypäjä. The incident involved two vehicles: a silver Volkswagen Golf TSI bearing Finnish license plate FAB 123 and a black Toyota Corolla Hybrid with license plate XYZ 456.

Witnesses at the scene, identified as Mr. Juhani Mäki (witness 1) and Ms. Liisa Koskela (witness 2), both residents of Kauppakatu, reported that the incident occurred when the Volkswagen Golf, driven by Mr. Marko Saarinen (driver 1), was traveling southbound on Kauppakatu at a speed estimated to be around 60 km/h. Simultaneously, the Toyota Corolla, driven by Ms. Sanna Nurmi (driver 2), was turning left from Mannerheimintie onto Kauppakatu, also moving at an approximate speed of 30 km/h.

According to witness statements, Mr. Saarinen failed to notice the turning Corolla and collided with it on the driver's side. The impact caused both vehicles to spin out of control, with the Volkswagen coming to a halt against a streetlight pole, while the Toyota came to rest partially on the sidewalk.

Upon arrival at the scene, emergency services found no injuries among the drivers or passengers involved. Both Mr. Saarinen and Ms. Nurmi were cooperative and provided statements to the investigating officer. The weather conditions were clear and sunny, with good visibility, and the road surfaces were dry.

The Volkswagen Golf sustained significant damage to its driver's side, including a collapsed passenger compartment door and a shattered side window. The Toyota Corolla suffered damage to its front-left fender and grille, as well as scrapes along the driver's side from the impact with the sidewalk.

The incident caused minor traffic disruptions for approximately 30 minutes while emergency services attended to the scene and cleared debris. Both vehicles were towed away for further inspection and repairs. The investigation is ongoing, with a focus on determining the exact cause of the collision and any contributing factors.
