 Title: Traffic Incident Report - 12.04.2025, Myrskylä, Finland

On the morning of April 12th, 2025, at approximately 8:37 AM local time, a multi-vehicle collision occurred on Kauppakatu (Shopping Street), near the intersection with Miettisalmentie (Mietti's Field Road) in Myrskylä, Finland. The incident involved six vehicles and resulted in minor injuries to several individuals.

The following is a detailed account of the events leading up to and including the collision:

1. Vehicle 1 (Volvo XC90, license plate F-ABC 123) was traveling southbound on Kauppakatu, driven by Mr. Juhani Lehto (45 years old).

2. Vehicle 2 (Toyota Corolla, license plate O-DEF 456), driven by Ms. Sanna Mäki (30 years old), was also moving southbound on Kauppakatu, immediately behind Mr. Lehto's vehicle.

3. As they approached the intersection with Miettisalmentie, a sudden gust of wind caused both vehicles to lose control due to reduced visibility and slippery road conditions.

4. Vehicle 1 swerved to the right, crossing into the northbound lane and colliding with Vehicle 3 (Ford Focus, license plate G-HIJ 789), driven by Mr. Markku Korpela (50 years old).

5. In an attempt to avoid the collision, Ms. Mäki applied her brakes hard, causing her vehicle to skid sideways and collide with the rear of Vehicle 1.

6. The impact from this collision caused Vehicle 2 to spin out of control and strike a street sign on the northeast corner of the intersection.

7. Meanwhile, Vehicle 4 (Audi A4, license plate J-KLM 901), driven by Ms. Liisa Niemi (28 years old), was approaching the intersection from Miettisalmentie. Unable to stop in time due to the initial collision, she collided with the rear of Vehicle 3.

8. The force of this impact caused Vehicle 3 to roll onto its side, blocking the northbound lanes on Kauppakatu.

9. Vehicle 5 (Skoda Octavia, license plate L-MNO 123), driven by Mr. Petri Saarinen (35 years old), was unable to stop in time and collided with the rear of Vehicle 4.

10. The final vehicle involved, Vehicle 6 (Mercedes C-Class, license plate P-QRS 567), driven by Ms. Anna Koskela (23 years old), witnessed the collision and pulled over to assist. She called emergency services immediately after stopping.

Upon arrival, emergency responders found all drivers and passengers unharmed but shaken. Mr. Lehto, Ms. Mäki, and Ms. Niemi were treated for minor injuries at the scene before being transported to a nearby hospital for further evaluation. The other drivers and passengers did not require medical attention.

The road was closed for approximately two hours while emergency services attended to the incident and cleared debris from the scene. Traffic was diverted through alternate routes during this time.

Weather conditions at the time of the collision were windy with gusts, reducing visibility and causing slippery road surfaces due to recent rainfall. The intersection where the accident occurred has since been treated with salt and sand to improve traction and visibility for motorists.

This report is based on eyewitness accounts, police investigation, and statements from the drivers involved. The incident remains under investigation by local authorities.
