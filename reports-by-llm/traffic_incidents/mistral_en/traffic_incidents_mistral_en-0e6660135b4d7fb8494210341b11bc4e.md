 Traffic Incident Report

Date: 21st of January, 2024
Location: Marttila, Finland
Incident Number: TI-2024-0037

On the day of January 21, 2024, at approximately 14:36 hours, a traffic incident occurred on Kauppakatu (Shopping Street) near the intersection with Mannerheimintie (Mannerheim Avenue), in Marttila, Finland. The incident involved two vehicles and resulted in minor injuries to one of the drivers.

The first vehicle involved was a silver 2018 Volvo XC60 (license plate F-XYZ 123) driven by Mr. Jukka Saarinen, aged 45, of Kauppakatu 29, Marttila. The second vehicle was a red 2020 Toyota Corolla (license plate O-ABC 987) driven by Ms. Liisa Koskela, aged 32, of Mannerheimintie 45, Marttila.

According to eyewitness accounts, Mr. Saarinen was traveling southbound on Kauppakatu at a moderate speed when he failed to stop at the red traffic light at the intersection with Mannerheimintie. Ms. Koskela, who was traveling eastbound on Mannerheimintie, had the right of way but did not notice Mr. Saarinen's vehicle due to the sun glare.

As a result, Ms. Koskela's Toyota Corolla collided with the driver's side of Mr. Saarinen's Volvo XC60. The impact caused both vehicles to spin out of control and come to a stop on the intersection.

The weather conditions at the time were clear and sunny, which may have contributed to the reduced visibility for Ms. Koskela. The road surfaces were dry and free of ice or snow, but the sun glare could have impaired her ability to see the approaching Volvo XC60.

Upon arrival, emergency services found both drivers uninjured but shaken. Mr. Saarinen was visibly upset and admitted to running the red light. Ms. Koskela sustained minor injuries to her arm and was transported to Marttila Hospital for treatment.

The Volvo XC60 sustained significant damage to its driver's side, including a collapsed passenger door and a shattered side window. The Toyota Corolla had damage to the front bumper and hood, as well as a cracked windshield.

This incident serves as a reminder for all drivers to adhere to traffic rules, pay attention to road conditions, and be mindful of other road users, especially in situations where visibility may be reduced due to weather or environmental factors.

Investigation is ongoing to determine the exact cause of the accident and any potential charges against Mr. Saarinen for running a red light.
