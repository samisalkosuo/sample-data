 Title: Traffic Incident Report - 30.04.2025, Pori, Finland

On the day of April 30th, 2025, at approximately 14:37 hours, an unfortunate traffic incident occurred on Mannerheimintie (State Road 8), a major thoroughfare in the city of Pori, Finland. The incident involved three vehicles and resulted in minor injuries to several individuals.

The first vehicle, a silver Volvo XC90 with license plate F-ABC 123, was being driven by Mr. Juhani Kivinen (58) southbound towards the city center. The second vehicle, a red Toyota Corolla with license plate O-DEF 456, was being driven by Ms. Sanna Mäki (34) in the opposite direction, northbound. The third vehicle, a black Audi Q7 with license plate G-HIJ 789, was stationary on the side of the road due to a mechanical issue, with Mr. Markku Saarinen (45) and his daughter, Emma (10), waiting for assistance.

As Mr. Kivinen approached the stationary Audi Q7, he noticed the red Toyota Corolla drifting towards his lane due to the windy conditions. In an attempt to avoid a collision, Mr. Kivinen swerved to the right but lost control of his vehicle, which skidded across the road and collided with the stationary Audi Q7 on the passenger side.

The impact caused the Audi Q7 to roll onto its side, trapping Mr. Saarinen and Emma inside. Witnesses at the scene, including a passerby named Petri Lappalainen (32) and a bus driver named Matti Koskela (48), immediately called emergency services and assisted in freeing the trapped individuals.

Ms. Mäki's Toyota Corolla sustained significant damage to its front-end, while Mr. Kivinen's Volvo XC90 had damage to its passenger side and right rear. Both drivers were shaken but uninjured. Ms. Emma Saarinen complained of minor pain in her arm and was transported to the Pori Central Hospital for further evaluation.

The incident caused significant traffic congestion on Mannerheimintie, with emergency services requiring approximately 30 minutes to clear the scene. The road was closed in both directions during this time, causing delays for commuters and bus routes.

Weather conditions at the time of the incident were windy with gusts, which undoubtedly contributed to the initial drifting of Ms. Mäki's vehicle. Road surfaces were wet due to recent rainfall, further complicating driving conditions.

This report is being submitted for the official record and will be forwarded to the appropriate authorities for further investigation and analysis. Recommendations for improved road safety measures in windy conditions, such as increased signage or adjustments to traffic light timings, may be considered based on the findings of this investigation.
