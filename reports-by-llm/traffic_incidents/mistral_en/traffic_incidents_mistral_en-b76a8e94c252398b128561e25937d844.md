Location: Somero, Finland
Incident Number: SOM-230117-001

On the evening of January 17th, 2023, at approximately 19:35 hours, a traffic incident occurred on Mäkelänkatu (Mäkelä Street), a major road in the municipality of Somero. The incident involved two vehicles: a silver Volvo XC60 with license plate F-XYZ 123 and a black Toyota Corolla with license plate O-ABC 456.

Witnesses at the scene reported that the Volvo, driven by Mr. Juhani Mäkelä (age 42, resident of Mäkelänkatu 21), was traveling southbound on Mäkelänkatu when it lost control due to slippery road conditions caused by snowfall. The vehicle veered off the road and collided with a street sign before skidding into the path of the oncoming Toyota Corolla, driven by Ms. Liisa Somero (age 35, resident of Somerontie 37).

Ms. Somero attempted to swerve to avoid the collision but was unable to do so in time. The front ends of both vehicles collided, causing significant damage to both. Mr. Mäkelä's Volvo sustained damage to its front bumper, grille, and left headlight, while Ms. Somero's Corolla had damage to its front bumper, hood, and windshield.

Emergency services arrived at the scene within minutes of the incident being reported. Both drivers were uninjured but shaken by the event. Mr. Mäkelä was issued a traffic violation for careless driving due to the slippery road conditions.

The incident caused minor traffic disruptions as emergency vehicles attended to the scene and police diverted traffic away from the area. The road was cleared and reopened by 20:15 hours.

Weather conditions at the time of the incident were snowy, with visibility reduced due to heavy snowfall. Roads in the Somero area had been treated with salt and sand earlier in the day but had become slick as temperatures dropped throughout the evening.

This report is based on witness statements, physical evidence at the scene, and the observations of responding officers. The incident remains under investigation by the Somero Police Department's traffic division.
