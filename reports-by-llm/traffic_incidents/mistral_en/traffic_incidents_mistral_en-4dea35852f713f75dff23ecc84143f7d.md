**Narrative:**

On the morning of May 13, 2024, at approximately 08:37, a traffic incident occurred on Mäkelänkatu, near the intersection with Kylpylänkatu, in Tuusula. The incident involved two vehicles: a silver 2023 Volvo XC60 (license plate F-XYZ123) driven by Mr. Juhani Särkijärvi, aged 45, and a black 2022 Toyota Corolla (license plate O-ABC987) driven by Ms. Liisa Mäkeläinen, aged 38.

According to eyewitness accounts, Mr. Särkijärvi was traveling southbound on Mäkelänkatu at a speed estimated between 60 and 70 km/h. Ms. Mäkeläinen was approaching the same intersection from Kylpylänkatu, also heading south, at an approximate speed of 40 km/h.

As Mr. Särkijärvi approached the intersection, he failed to notice that Ms. Mäkeläinen had a red light and proceeded to make a left turn onto Kylpylänkatu. The wet and slippery road conditions caused Mr. Särkijärvi's Volvo to lose traction, resulting in a collision with the front passenger side of Ms. Mäkeläinen's Toyota.

The impact caused both vehicles to spin out of control, with the Volvo coming to rest against a street sign on the southwest corner of the intersection, and the Toyota coming to rest diagonally across Mäkelänkatu, partially blocking the southbound lane.
