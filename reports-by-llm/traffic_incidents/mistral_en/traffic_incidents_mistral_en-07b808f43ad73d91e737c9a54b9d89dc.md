Time of Incident: 18:37 (evening)
Weather Conditions: Light rain

Vehicles Involved:
1. Vehicle 1 - A silver 2024 Volvo XC60 with license plate FIN-ABC 123, driven by Mr. Jari Mäki (driver) and carrying Mrs. Sanna Mäki (passenger). The vehicle was traveling southbound on Kauppakatu.
2. Vehicle 2 - A black 2022 Toyota Corolla with license plate FIN-DEF 456, driven by Ms. Liisa Koskela (driver) and carrying Mr. Eero Koskela (passenger). The vehicle was traveling northbound on Kauppakatu.

Witnesses:
1. Mr. Marko Saari, a local resident who lives at 2A Mannerheimintie, Ylöjärvi. He was walking his dog near the intersection of Kauppakatu and Mannerheimintie when he observed the incident.
2. Ms. Anna Niemi, a passenger in a bus (Bus 123) that was stopped at the traffic light on Kauppakatu due to the accident. She provided her statement after being questioned by the responding officers.

Incident Description:
According to witness statements and evidence gathered at the scene, both vehicles were traveling in opposite directions on Kauppakatu when Vehicle 1, driven by Mr. Mäki, failed to stop at a red light at the intersection with Mannerheimintie. The vehicle collided with Vehicle 2, which was unable to avoid the impact due to the poor visibility caused by the light rain.

Upon arrival, responding officers found both vehicles severely damaged but still operable. Mr. Mäki and Mrs. Sanna Mäki were visibly shaken but uninjured. Ms. Koskela and Mr. Eero Koskela also reported no injuries.

The intersection of Kauppakatu and Mannerheimintie was closed for approximately two hours to allow for the investigation, cleanup, and removal of the damaged vehicles. Traffic was diverted through alternate routes during this time.

Road Conditions:
At the time of the incident, the road surface was wet due to the light rain. Visibility was reduced but not significantly impaired. The intersection where the accident occurred had functioning traffic signals and reflective markings on the pavement.

Investigation Findings:
Preliminary findings suggest that Mr. Mäki may have been distracted or failed to notice the red light due to the poor visibility caused by the light rain. Further investigation, including reviewing dashcam footage from both vehicles and interviewing witnesses, will be conducted to determine the exact cause of the accident.

Recommendations:
1. Increase visibility at intersections during adverse weather conditions through additional lighting or reflective markings.
2. Remind drivers to remain alert and focused while driving, especially in poor weather conditions.
3. Encourage regular vehicle maintenance to ensure proper functioning of lights and brakes.

This report is preliminary and subject to change as the investigation continues. Further updates will be provided as necessary.
