 Traffic Incident Report

Date: 28.03.2023
Location: Eurajoki, Finland
Incident Number: 23-1456
Time of Occurrence: 23:37 (Night)
Weather Conditions: Mixed snow and rain

Upon arrival at the scene, I found two vehicles involved in a collision on Kauppakatu (Shopping Street), near the intersection with Linnankatu (Castle Street). The incident occurred approximately 50 meters north of the address Kauppakatu 23.

The first vehicle, a silver Volvo V60 with license plate FIN-ABC123, was traveling southbound on Kauppakatu when it collided with a red Toyota Corolla (license plate FIN-DEF456) that was turning left from Linnankatu onto Kauppakatu.

According to eyewitness accounts, the Volvo was driving at an excessive speed for the weather conditions, which included mixed snow and rain, making it difficult for drivers to see clearly. The Toyota, driven by a 35-year-old female named Anna Mattila (resident of Linnankatu 12), had activated its turn signal but failed to yield right-of-way to the oncoming Volvo.

The impact caused both vehicles to spin out of control and come to rest on the east side of Kauppakatu, partially blocking the road. The Volvo sustained significant front-end damage, while the Toyota's left rear fender was crushed.

Upon examination, I found no signs of intoxication or distraction from either driver. Both drivers and passengers reported no serious injuries but were transported to Eurajoki Hospital for precautionary checks. The drivers involved in the incident are:

1. Mark Johnson (resident of Kauppakatu 35), 42, driving the Volvo V60
2. Anna Mattila (resident of Linnankatu 12), 35, driving the Toyota Corolla

The road was closed for approximately one hour while the vehicles were removed and the scene was cleared. The incident is currently under investigation, with a focus on determining whether excessive speed or failure to yield right-of-way played a significant role in the collision.

This report will be forwarded to the Eurajoki Police Department for further action.
