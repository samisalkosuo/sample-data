 Title: Traffic Incident Report
Date: July 21, 2024
Location: Mynämäki, Finland
Incident Number: 24-3678

On the day of July 21, 2024, at approximately 15:30 hours, a three-vehicle collision occurred on Vuokkosenkatu, near the intersection with Kylänkatu. The incident involved vehicles with the following details:

1. A silver Toyota Corolla (license plate F-ABC 123) driven by Mr. Juhani Lehto, aged 45, traveling southbound on Vuokkosenkatu.
2. A red Volkswagen Golf (license plate O-DEF 456) driven by Ms. Sanna Mäki, aged 32, also traveling southbound on Vuokkosenkatu.
3. A blue Ford Fiesta (license plate G-HIJ 789) driven by Mr. Markku Saari, aged 50, turning left from Kylänkatu onto northbound Vuokkosenkatu.

According to eyewitness accounts, the incident occurred as a result of adverse weather conditions and poor visibility due to wind gusts. Mr. Saari, while attempting to turn left, failed to notice the approaching vehicles due to the reduced visibility. Ms. Mäki was unable to stop her vehicle in time, colliding with Mr. Saari's Ford Fiesta. The impact caused Mr. Lehto's Toyota Corolla, which was following behind, to rear-end Ms. Mäki's Volkswagen Golf.

The incident resulted in minor injuries for all parties involved. Mr. Lehto and Ms. Mäki sustained cuts and bruises, while Mr. Saari complained of neck pain. All three were transported to the Mynämäki Hospital for treatment.

Upon arrival at the scene, emergency services found the vehicles partially blocking the road. The Toyota Corolla had significant front-end damage, with the airbags deployed. The Volkswagen Golf sustained damage to its front and left side, while the Ford Fiesta's front-left fender was crushed.

The road was closed for approximately two hours while the vehicles were removed and the scene was investigated. Traffic was diverted through alternative routes during this time.

Weather conditions at the time of the incident included strong winds with gusts, reducing visibility and making driving conditions challenging. The road surface was wet but otherwise clear, with no reported issues prior to or following the incident.

This report is based on eyewitness accounts, police investigation, and medical assessments at the scene. Further investigations may be conducted as necessary.
