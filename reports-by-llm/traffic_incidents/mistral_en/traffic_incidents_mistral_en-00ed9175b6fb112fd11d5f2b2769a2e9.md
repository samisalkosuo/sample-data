3. As a result, Ms. Koskela's Volkswagen Golf collided with the front-right side of Mr. Mäki's Toyota Corolla. The impact caused both vehicles to spin out of control and collide with the curb on the east side of Kauppakatu.
4. Shortly after, Mr. Saarinen, who was driving northbound in his Hyundai Tucson, failed to react in time to the collision and rear-ended Ms. Koskela's Volkswagen Golf.

Injuries:
1. Mr. Mäki sustained minor cuts and bruises but was otherwise unharmed. He was treated at the scene by paramedics and released shortly after.

Damage:

The incident is currently under investigation by the Konnevesi Police Department.
