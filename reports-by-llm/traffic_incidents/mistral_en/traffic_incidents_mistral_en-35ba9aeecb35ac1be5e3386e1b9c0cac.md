On the morning of January 4th, 2024, at approximately 9:37 AM, a three-vehicle collision occurred on Kauppakatu (Shopping Street) near the intersection with Miettisalmentie (Mietti Farm Road). The incident involved vehicles with the following details:

1. A silver Toyota Corolla (license plate FIN-ABC 123), driven by Mr. Jukka Saarinen, aged 45, and carrying two passengers, Ms. Liisa MÃ¤ki, aged 40, and their child, aged 7.

2. A red Volkswagen Golf (license plate FIN-DEF 456), driven by Ms. Sanna Koskinen, aged 32, with no passengers.

3. A blue Ford Fiesta (license plate FIN-GHI 789), driven by Mr. Marko Lappalainen, aged 28, and carrying one passenger, Ms. Anna Niemi, aged 25.

According to eyewitness accounts, the incident began when Mr. Saarinen's Toyota Corolla was approaching the intersection from Kauppakatu with a green light. Simultaneously, Ms. Koskinen's Volkswagen Golf was traveling southbound on Miettisalmentie, also with a green light. As Mr. Saarinen turned left onto Miettisalmentie, his vehicle collided with the front-right side of Ms. Koskinen's car. The impact caused Ms. Koskinen to lose control, and her Volkswagen Golf veered into the path of an oncoming Ford Fiesta driven by Mr. Lappalainen.

Mr. Lappalainen attempted to swerve but was unable to avoid the collision, resulting in his vehicle striking the driver's side of Ms. Koskinen's car. The impact caused significant damage to all three vehicles, with the Toyota Corolla sustaining damage to its front-left fender and bumper, the Volkswagen Golf having extensive front-right and rear-end damage, and the Ford Fiesta experiencing damage to its driver's side doors and fenders.

Emergency services arrived at the scene within minutes, with police officers, firefighters, and paramedics all responding promptly. The passengers in Mr. Saarinen's vehicle were shaken but uninjured, while Ms. Koskinen sustained minor injuries to her arm and was transported to Uurainen Hospital for treatment. Ms. Niemi, the passenger in Mr. Lappalainen's car, was unharmed.

The road conditions at the time of the incident were wet due to light rainfall, which may have contributed to the slick surfaces and reduced visibility for the drivers involved. The intersection where the collision occurred has a history of accidents, prompting local authorities to consider installing traffic calming measures in the future.

This report is based on eyewitness accounts, physical evidence at the scene, and statements from the drivers and passengers involved. The incident remains under investigation by the Uurainen Police Department.
