 Title: Traffic Incident Report
Date: October 16, 2023
Location: Kaavi, Finland
Incident Number: KAV-231016-001

On the morning of October 16, 2023, at approximately 8:45 AM local time, a traffic incident occurred on Mäntyharju Street (B97), near the intersection with Pohjankuja (A4). The incident involved two vehicles: a silver Volkswagen Golf TSI, license plate F-ABC 123, driven by Mr. Juhani Särkijärvi, and a black Toyota Corolla Hybrid, license plate O-DEF 456, driven by Ms. Liisa Mäkelä.

According to eyewitness accounts, both vehicles were traveling in the same direction on Mäntyharju Street when the incident occurred. The overcast weather conditions and wet road surface due to light rain made visibility slightly challenging.

Mr. Särkijärvi, who was driving the Volkswagen Golf, reported that he had slowed down as he approached the intersection due to the poor visibility. However, Ms. Mäkelä, in the Toyota Corolla, did not notice the reduced speed of Mr. Särkijärvi's vehicle and collided with it from behind.

The impact caused both vehicles to spin out of control, with the Volkswagen coming to a stop on the side of the road, and the Toyota Corolla ending up in the median strip. No other vehicles were involved in the incident.

Emergency services arrived at the scene promptly and assessed the situation. Both drivers and passengers reported no serious injuries, though they were shaken up by the incident. The Volkswagen Golf sustained significant rear-end damage, while the Toyota Corolla had front-end damage.

The road was temporarily closed for cleanup and investigation purposes. Traffic was diverted through an alternate route during this time. The incident has been documented, and a full investigation is ongoing to determine the exact cause of the accident.

This report is preliminary and subject to change as the investigation continues. Further updates will be provided as necessary.
