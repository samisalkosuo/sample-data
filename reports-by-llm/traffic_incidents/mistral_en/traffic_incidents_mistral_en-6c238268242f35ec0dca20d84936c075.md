On the morning of April 3rd, 2024, at approximately 8:35 AM local time, a four-vehicle collision occurred on M채ntylahdenkatu (Highway 12), near the intersection with Kauppakatu, in the heart of Janakkala.

The following vehicles were involved in the incident:

1. Vehicle A - A white 2023 Volvo XC90 (license plate F-XYZ 123) driven by Mr. Juhani Lehto, aged 45, of M채ntylahdenkatu 76, Janakkala.
2. Vehicle B - A black 2022 Toyota Corolla (license plate F-XYZ 456) driven by Ms. Sanna Koskinen, aged 32, of Kauppakatu 38, Janakkala.
3. Vehicle C - A silver 2019 Mercedes-Benz E-Class (license plate F-XYZ 789) driven by Mr. Markku Saarinen, aged 52, of M채ntylahdenkatu 45, Janakkala.
4. Vehicle D - A blue 2016 Ford Focus (license plate F-XYZ 901) driven by Ms. Liisa Niemi, aged 28, of Kauppakatu 67, Janakkala.

According to eyewitness accounts and the investigation conducted at the scene, Mr. Lehto was traveling southbound on M채ntylahdenkatu in heavy fog conditions when he failed to notice the stopped traffic due to poor visibility. In an attempt to avoid a collision, he swerved into the northbound lane, directly into the path of Ms. Koskinen who was driving in that direction.

Ms. Koskinen, unable to react in time, collided with Mr. Lehto's vehicle, causing a chain reaction involving Vehicles C and D. Mr. Saarinen, who was following closely behind Ms. Koskinen, rear-ended her vehicle, while Ms. Niemi, traveling northbound, swerved to avoid the collision but ended up hitting Mr. Lehto's car from the side.

Upon arrival at the scene, emergency services found all drivers and passengers uninjured but shaken. The vehicles sustained significant damage:

- Vehicle A: Front-end damage, airbags deployed, windshield cracked.
- Vehicle B: Front-end and passenger-side damage, airbags deployed, side mirror detached.
- Vehicle C: Rear-end damage, airbags deployed, bumper dislodged.
- Vehicle D: Side-swipe damage, no airbag deployment, minor scratches on the driver's door.

The road was closed for approximately two hours while the vehicles were removed and the scene was cleared. The incident is currently under investigation by local authorities to determine the exact cause of the collision and any potential contributing factors.
