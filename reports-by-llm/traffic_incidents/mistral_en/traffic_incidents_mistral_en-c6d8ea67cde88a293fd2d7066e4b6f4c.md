On the night of December 14, 2022, at approximately 23:37 hours, a four-vehicle collision occurred on Kauppakatu (Shopping Street) near the intersection with Linnankatu (Castle Street), in the heart of Multia. The incident involved the following vehicles and parties:

1. Vehicle A (Volvo XC90, license plate FIN-ABC 123): Driven by Mr. Juhani Mäki, aged 45, with two passengers - Ms. Sanna Niemi, aged 42, and their child, aged 8.

4. Vehicle D (Skoda Octavia, license plate FIN-JKL 012): Driven by Mr. Petri Mäki, aged 52, with one passenger - Ms. Mari Saarinen, aged 49.

According to eyewitness accounts and the investigation conducted at the scene, the incident unfolded as follows:

- Mr. Juhani Mäki (Vehicle A) was traveling southbound on Kauppakatu, approaching the intersection with Linnankatu. Due to foggy conditions, visibility was significantly reduced, making it difficult for drivers to see beyond their immediate vicinity.
- Ms. Anna Lehto (Vehicle C), who was also heading southbound, failed to notice that Mr. Mäki's vehicle had slowed down due to the poor weather conditions and collided with the rear of Vehicle A at approximately 23:37 hours.
- The impact caused Vehicle A to swerve to the left, crossing into the northbound lane and striking Vehicle D head-on. Mr. Petri Mäki (Vehicle D) had no time to react and collided with the oncoming vehicle.
- The force of the collision caused both vehicles to spin out of control, with Vehicle A coming to a stop partially on the sidewalk, and Vehicle D coming to rest in the northbound lane.
- In the aftermath of the initial collision, Mr. Markku Saari (Vehicle B), who was traveling northbound, failed to notice the stopped vehicles ahead and collided with the rear of Vehicle A at approximately 23:38 hours.

Upon arrival, emergency services found all parties involved in the incident unharmed but shaken. The foggy conditions and reduced visibility were determined to have played a significant role in the incident. No alcohol or drug impairment was suspected for any of the drivers involved.

Damage assessments revealed that Vehicle A sustained extensive front-end damage, with the bumper, grille, and hood severely damaged. The rear of Vehicle C also showed signs of impact, with a dented bumper and cracked taillight. Both Vehicles D and B had significant front-end damage, with crumpled fenders, bent headlights, and shattered windshields.

The incident caused minor traffic disruptions in the area for approximately one hour while emergency services attended to the scene and cleared debris from the roadway. The vehicles were towed away for further inspection and repairs.

This report is being submitted for the official record and will be forwarded to the appropriate authorities for further investigation and potential charges, as deemed necessary.
