 Title: Traffic Incident Report - Ranua, Finland - 25.12.2023, 23:45

On the night of December 25th, 2023, at approximately 23:45, a multi-vehicle collision occurred on Kauppakatu (Shopping Street) in Ranua, Finland. The incident involved seven vehicles and resulted in minor injuries to several individuals.

The sequence of events began when Mr. Juhani Mäki, driving a 2018 Volvo XC60 with the license plate F-XYZ 123, lost control of his vehicle due to icy road conditions as he approached the intersection at Kauppakatu and Linnankatu (Castle Street). Mr. Mäki's vehicle slid into the path of an oncoming 2021 Toyota Corolla driven by Ms. Sanna Koskela, who was unable to avoid a collision.

As a result of the initial impact, both vehicles spun out of control and collided with three additional vehicles waiting at the red light: a 2022 Ford Focus (license plate O-ABC 456) driven by Mr. Marko Saari, a 2019 Mercedes-Benz C-Class (license plate L-DEF 789) driven by Ms. Liisa Hämäläinen, and a 2017 Hyundai i30 (license plate P-GHI 901) driven by Mr. Petri Nurmi.

Witnesses at the scene reported that the icy road conditions had made it difficult for drivers to maintain control of their vehicles, contributing to the severity of the collision. Ms. Anna Lehto, a local resident who was walking her dog nearby, provided statements describing the chaotic scene and the immediate aftermath of the accident.

Upon arrival, emergency services found that all parties involved were able to exit their vehicles without assistance. Mr. Mäki, Ms. Koskela, and Mr. Saari sustained minor injuries and were transported to Ranua Hospital for treatment. The other drivers and passengers involved in the incident did not report any injuries.

The vehicles involved in the collision sustained significant damage, with Mr. Mäki's Volvo XC60 suffering front-end damage, Ms. Koskela's Toyota Corolla experiencing rear-end damage, and all other vehicles displaying various degrees of cosmetic and structural damage.

Road closures were implemented at the scene to allow for the safe removal of the damaged vehicles and the investigation of the incident by local authorities. The icy road conditions were addressed by the city's maintenance crew, who applied salt and sand to improve traction and prevent further accidents.

This report will be forwarded to the appropriate departments for further analysis and potential traffic safety improvements in Ranua.
