 Title: Traffic Incident Report
Date: 08.06.2025
Location: Orivesi, Finland
Incident Number: TI-2025-ORV-001

On the evening of June 8th, 2025, at approximately 19:37 hours, a traffic incident occurred on Kauppakatu (Shopping Street) near the intersection with Linnankatu (Castle Street), in the heart of Orivesi. The incident involved two vehicles: a silver Volvo XC60 with license plate F-XYZ 123 and a black Audi Q5 with license plate O-ABC 456.

Witness accounts suggest that the Volvo, driven by Mr. Juhani Mäki (age 42, resident of Kauppakatu 21), was traveling southbound on Kauppakatu at a speed estimated to be slightly above the posted 50 km/h limit. The Audi, driven by Ms. Sanna Koskela (age 35, resident of Linnankatu 37), was turning left from Linnankatu onto Kauppakatu when the incident occurred.

Heavy rain had been falling throughout the evening, significantly reducing visibility and making the roads slippery. The wet conditions, combined with Mr. Mäki's reported excessive speed, are believed to have contributed to the accident. As Ms. Koskela began her turn, her Audi hydroplaned on the slick road surface, causing it to slide sideways into the path of the oncoming Volvo.

The front left bumper of the Volvo collided with the rear right quarter panel of the Audi, causing both vehicles to spin out of control. The Volvo came to a stop against a street lamp on the southwest corner of the intersection, while the Audi ended up partially blocking the northbound lane of Kauppakatu.

Emergency services arrived at the scene within minutes and assessed the condition of all parties involved. Both drivers reported no serious injuries but were taken to Orivesi Hospital for further examination. No passengers were present in either vehicle.

The traffic incident caused significant delays in the area, with police diverting traffic around the blocked intersection until the vehicles could be towed away and the road cleared. The incident remains under investigation, with a focus on determining the exact speed of Mr. Mäki's vehicle at the time of impact and assessing the role of the heavy rain in contributing to the accident.

This report is based on witness statements, physical evidence at the scene, and CCTV footage from nearby buildings. Further updates will be provided as the investigation progresses.
