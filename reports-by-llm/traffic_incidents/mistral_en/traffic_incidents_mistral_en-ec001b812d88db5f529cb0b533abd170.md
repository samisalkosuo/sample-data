Date: August 19, 2023
Location: Hanko, Finland
Incident Number: 23-45678

On the evening of August 19, 2023, a four-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Merikatu streets in Hanko. The incident involved the following vehicles and parties:

1. Vehicle A (Licence Plate: FIN-ABC 123) - A 2022 Toyota Corolla driven by Mr. John Eriksson, aged 45, of Kauppakatu 21, Hanko.
2. Vehicle B (Licence Plate: FIN-DEF 456) - A 2018 Volkswagen Golf driven by Ms. Anna Svensson, aged 37, of Merikatu 34, Hanko.
3. Vehicle C (Licence Plate: FIN-GHI 789) - A 2015 Ford Focus driven by Mr. Mark Johnson, aged 52, of Kauppakatu 15, Hanko.
4. Vehicle D (Licence Plate: FIN-JKL 0MN) - A 2019 Mercedes-Benz C-Class with unidentified driver, as the individual fled the scene before emergency services arrived.

The incident occurred at approximately 7:30 PM local time. Witnesses reported that Mr. Eriksson was traveling south on Kauppakatu while Ms. Svensson was heading west on Merikatu. Both drivers claimed they had a green light and did not see the other vehicle until it was too late.

Mr. Johnson, who was driving north on Kauppakatu, stated that he saw the collision unfold in his rearview mirror as he approached the intersection. He attempted to stop but was unable to avoid colliding with Vehicle A and Vehicle B. The unidentified driver of Vehicle D was traveling east on Merikatu at high speed and failed to stop at the red light, causing the initial collision between Vehicles A and B.

The foggy weather conditions significantly reduced visibility, making it difficult for drivers to see each other or react in time to avoid the accident. The road surface was wet due to recent rainfall, which further complicated the situation.

Upon arrival, emergency services found all four vehicles severely damaged. Vehicle A and B sustained front-end damage, while Vehicle C had damage to both the front and rear ends. Vehicle D fled the scene before emergency services arrived, leaving behind debris from its shattered headlights and a damaged bumper.

No fatalities were reported, but several parties involved in the collision suffered minor injuries and were transported to Hanko Hospital for treatment. The incident caused significant traffic disruptions in the area, with police diverting traffic away from the intersection until it could be safely reopened at around 10:30 PM.

The investigation into this incident is ongoing, with a focus on identifying the unidentified driver of Vehicle D and determining the exact sequence of events leading up to the collision. Witness statements and traffic camera footage are being reviewed as part of the investigation.

This report will be updated as more information becomes available.
