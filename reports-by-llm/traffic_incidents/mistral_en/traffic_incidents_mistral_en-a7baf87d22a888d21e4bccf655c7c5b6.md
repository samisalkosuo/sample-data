Incident Number: 23-14567

On the evening of August 9th, 2023, at approximately 19:30 hours, a traffic incident occurred on Kauppakatu (Shopping Street), near the intersection with Linnankatu (Castle Street). The incident involved two vehicles: a silver Volvo V60 with license plate F-ABC 123 and a black Toyota Corolla with license plate XYZ-456.

Witnesses at the scene reported that the Volvo, driven by Mr. Jari Mäki (age 42, address: Kauppakatu 2A), was traveling southbound on Kauppakatu when it lost control due to icy road conditions. The vehicle slid into the intersection and collided with the Toyota Corolla, which was driven by Ms. Liisa Koskela (age 35, address: Linnankatu 10B), who was waiting for a green light to proceed eastbound on Linnankatu.

Ms. Koskela and her passenger, Mr. Marko Hämäläinen (age 40, address: Linnankatu 12C), were both transported to Forssa Hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. Mr. Mäki was unharmed but visibly shaken.

Upon arrival at the scene, emergency services found that the Volvo had sustained significant front-end damage, while the Toyota Corolla had damage to its passenger side and front bumper. The road was closed for approximately two hours to allow for the removal of the vehicles and cleanup of debris.

The incident serves as a reminder to all drivers to exercise caution when driving on icy roads, especially during the evening hours. It is essential to maintain a safe following distance, reduce speed, and ensure that vehicles are properly equipped with winter tires.

This report will be forwarded to the Traffic Accident Investigation Unit for further analysis.
