Witness Accounts:
A local resident, Mr. Eero Laine (70 years old), living at Mannerheimintie 98, reported seeing the initial collision between Vehicles 1 and 2. He stated that both vehicles were traveling west on Kauppakatu when they collided at the intersection due to poor visibility caused by heavy rain.

Ms. Sanna Koskinen (32 years old), a passenger in Vehicle 2, also witnessed the initial collision and described it as a "chain reaction" that involved several vehicles. She stated that after the initial impact, other vehicles swerved to avoid the accident but ended up colliding with each other or the stationary vehicles.

Investigation Findings:
Upon arrival at the scene, emergency responders found all six vehicles damaged and blocking the intersection. The Toyota Corolla (Vehicle 1) sustained significant front-end damage, while the Mercedes-Benz C-Class (Vehicle 2) had damage to both the front and rear ends. The other vehicles involved also showed varying degrees of damage.

The heavy rainfall and poor visibility were determined to be contributing factors in the incident. Road conditions were reported as wet and slippery, making it difficult for drivers to maintain control of their vehicles.

Given the hazardous weather conditions, we recommend increased caution and reduced speed limits during heavy rainfall events. Additionally, we suggest further investigation into the possibility of installing traffic signals or improved signage at this intersection to improve safety for motorists.

Conclusion:
This multi-vehicle collision occurred due to poor visibility caused by heavy rainfall during the nighttime hours in Vesilahti, Finland. Six vehicles were involved, resulting in minor injuries to several individuals. The incident highlights the importance of increased caution and reduced speed limits during adverse weather conditions. Further investigation is ongoing to determine additional safety measures that could be implemented at this intersection.
