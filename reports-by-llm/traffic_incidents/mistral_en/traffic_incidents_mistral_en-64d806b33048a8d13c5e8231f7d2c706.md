 **Traffic Incident Report**

Date: June 18, 2024
Location: Toholampi, Finland
Incident Number: 24-TOL-0618-001

On the morning of June 18, 2024, at approximately 08:37 AM local time, a four-vehicle collision occurred on Kauppakatu (Shopping Street) near the intersection with Miettisalmentie (Mietti Farm Road). The incident involved the following vehicles and parties:

1. Vehicle A (2024 Toyota Corolla, license plate F-ABC 123): Driven by Mr. Jari Kivinen (age 35), with a passenger, Ms. Liisa M채ki (age 32).
2. Vehicle B (2022 Volkswagen Golf, license plate F-DEF 456): Driven by Ms. Sanna Nurmi (age 28), with no passengers.
3. Vehicle C (2019 Ford Focus, license plate F-GHI 789): Driven by Mr. Marko Lappalainen (age 42), with a passenger, Ms. Anna H채m채l채inen (age 45).
4. Vehicle D (2023 Hyundai Tucson, license plate F-JKL 901): Driven by Mr. Eero Saarinen (age 58), with no passengers.

According to eyewitness accounts and the sequence of events, the incident began when Vehicle A, traveling south on Kauppakatu, approached the intersection with Miettisalmentie. At the same time, Vehicle B was stopped at the red light facing north on Miettisalmentie, intending to turn left onto Kauppakatu.

As Vehicle A approached the intersection, it is believed that Mr. Kivinen failed to notice the red light for the cross traffic and proceeded through the intersection, colliding with Vehicle B as it turned left. The impact caused Vehicle B to spin out of control and collide with the curb on the northeast corner of the intersection.

Meanwhile, Vehicles C and D were traveling south on Kauppakatu behind Vehicle A. Upon witnessing the collision between Vehicles A and B, Mr. Lappalainen attempted to swerve to avoid the accident but was unable to do so, colliding with the rear of Vehicle A. In response, Vehicle D also swerved to avoid the collision, striking the passenger side of Vehicle C.

The incident resulted in extensive damage to all four vehicles and required the attendance of emergency services, including the Toholampi Fire Department and the Toholampi Police Department's Traffic Unit. No fatalities were reported; however, several parties sustained minor injuries and were transported to the Toholampi Hospital for treatment.

The weather conditions at the time of the incident consisted of light rain, which likely contributed to reduced visibility and slick road surfaces. The road surface was wet but otherwise in good condition, with no significant obstructions or hazards present.

This report is preliminary and subject to further investigation by the Toholampi Police Department's Traffic Unit. Charges may be filed against Mr. Kivinen for failure to obey a traffic control device, which is considered a traffic violation under Finnish law.
