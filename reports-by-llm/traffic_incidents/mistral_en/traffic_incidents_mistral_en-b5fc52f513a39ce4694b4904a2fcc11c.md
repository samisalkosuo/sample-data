Incident Number: FIN-KT-2025-0034

On the morning of March 6th, 2025, at approximately 8:17 AM local time, a traffic incident occurred on Mäkelänkatu (Mäkelä Street) near the intersection with Keskuskatu (City Center Street), in the municipality of Koski Tl. The incident involved two vehicles: a silver Volvo XC90 (license plate FIN-ABC 123) driven by Mr. Juhani Särkijärvi, aged 45, and a black Mercedes E-Class (license plate FIN-DEF 456) driven by Ms. Liisa Mäkeläinen, aged 38.

According to eyewitness accounts, both vehicles were traveling in the same direction on Mäkelänkatu when strong gusts of wind caused Mr. Särkijärvi's Volvo to swerve into the adjacent lane, colliding with Ms. Mäkeläinen's Mercedes. The impact was significant, causing both vehicles to spin out of control and come to a halt on the opposite side of the road.

The first emergency services arrived at the scene at 8:23 AM, followed by local police officers. Mr. Särkijärvi and Ms. Mäkeläinen were both uninjured but shaken up from the incident. The Volvo sustained damage to its front bumper and left headlight, while the Mercedes had damage to its right rear fender and a cracked windshield.

The weather conditions at the time of the incident were windy with gusts, which likely contributed to Mr. Särkijärvi's loss of control. Road conditions were wet due to recent rainfall, making it more challenging for drivers to maintain traction.

Witnesses at the scene provided statements corroborating the events leading up to the collision. The incident caused a temporary traffic disruption on Mäkelänkatu, with police directing traffic around the accident site until the vehicles were towed away at 9:30 AM.

This report is preliminary and subject to further investigation by the local police department's traffic unit. No charges have been filed at this time, but the incident remains under review.
