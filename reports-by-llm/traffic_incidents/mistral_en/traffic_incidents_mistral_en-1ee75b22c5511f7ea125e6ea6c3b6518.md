 Title: Traffic Incident Report
Date: 08.12.2023
Location: Rauma, Finland
Incident Number: RA-231208-001

On the day of December 8th, 2023, at approximately 14:37 hours, a traffic incident occurred on Kauppakatu (Shopping Street) near the intersection with Torikatu (Market Street), in the heart of Rauma. The incident involved two vehicles: a silver Volvo V60 with license plate FIN-ABC 123 and a black Opel Astra with license plate FIN-DEF 456.

Witnesses at the scene reported that the Volvo, driven by Mr. Juhani Mäki (age 45, resident of Kauppakatu 23), was traveling southbound on Kauppakatu when it collided with the Opel, which was turning left from Torikatu onto Kauppakatu, driven by Ms. Liisa Koskela (age 38, resident of Torikatu 17).

According to eyewitness accounts, Mr. Mäki failed to notice the Opel due to poor visibility caused by overcast weather conditions. The Volvo struck the Opel's passenger side, causing both vehicles to spin out of control and come to a halt on the opposite sides of the intersection.

Upon arrival at the scene, emergency services found no injuries among the four occupants involved (Mr. Mäki, Ms. Koskela, and their respective passengers). However, both vehicles sustained significant damage: the Volvo's front-end was crumpled, while the Opel's passenger side door was dented and its left rear wheel was damaged.

The road surface was wet due to the overcast weather conditions, which may have contributed to the incident. The intersection of Kauppakatu and Torikatu was closed for approximately two hours while the vehicles were removed and the scene was cleared.

This report is preliminary in nature and further investigation will be conducted to determine the exact cause of the accident. All parties involved have been informed of the incident, and no charges have been filed at this time.
