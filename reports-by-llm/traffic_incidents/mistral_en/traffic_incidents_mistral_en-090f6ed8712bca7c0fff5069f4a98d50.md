Incident Summary:
On the night of May 29th, 2023, at approximately 21:45, a traffic incident occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Linnankatu in Rääkkylä, Finland. The incident involved two vehicles: a silver 2018 Volvo XC60 (license plate F-ABC 123) driven by Mr. Juhani Mäki (age 45, resident of Kauppakatu 21) and a black 2019 Toyota Corolla (license plate O-DEF 456) driven by Ms. Liisa Koskela (age 38, resident of Linnankatu 37).

According to eyewitness accounts, Mr. Mäki was traveling southbound on Kauppakatu while Ms. Koskela was heading east on Linnankatu. Due to the foggy conditions and reduced visibility, Mr. Mäki failed to stop at the red light at the intersection, colliding with Ms. Koskela's vehicle as she proceeded through the intersection on a green light.

The impact caused both vehicles to spin out of control, blocking the intersection for approximately 30 minutes until emergency services arrived and cleared the scene. Mr. Mäki and Ms. Koskela were uninjured but shaken from the incident.

Upon arrival, officers noted significant damage to both vehicles. The Volvo sustained front-end damage, with the bumper and grille severely damaged, while the Toyota's passenger side was crushed due to the impact.

Witness statements were taken on site, and both drivers were issued traffic violation notices for failing to stop at a red light (Mr. Mäki) and running a red light (Ms. Koskela). The incident is currently under investigation by local authorities.
