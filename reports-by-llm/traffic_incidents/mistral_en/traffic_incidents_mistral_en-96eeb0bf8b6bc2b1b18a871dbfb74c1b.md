 Title: Traffic Incident Report
Date: 07.03.2023
Location: Pudasjärvi, Finland
Incident Number: 23-PJ-0014

On the evening of March 7th, 2023, at approximately 19:35 local time, a traffic incident occurred on Kauppakatu (Shopping Street) near the intersection with Linnankatu (Castle Street), in Pudasjärvi. The incident involved two vehicles: a silver Volkswagen Golf TSI bearing Finnish license plate FAB 1234 and a black Toyota Corolla Hybrid with license plate XYZ 5678.

Witness accounts suggest that the Volkswagen, driven by Mr. Juhani Mäki (age 35, resident of Kauppakatu 20) was traveling southbound on Kauppakatu at a speed estimated to be around 60 km/h. Simultaneously, the Toyota Corolla, driven by Ms. Liisa Koskela (age 42, resident of Linnankatu 15), was turning left from Linnankatu onto Kauppakatu.

As Ms. Koskela began her turn, she reportedly failed to yield right-of-way to the oncoming Volkswagen. The front bumper of the Corolla collided with the driver's side door of the Golf, causing both vehicles to spin out of control and come to a stop on the intersection.

The impact caused significant damage to both vehicles. The driver's side door of the Volkswagen was crushed, while the front end of the Toyota sustained heavy damage. No airbags were deployed in either vehicle.

Both drivers and passengers reported minor injuries, including whiplash and cuts from broken glass. All parties involved were transported to Pudasjärvi Hospital for treatment.

The incident was further complicated by the light rain that fell throughout the evening, making the road surface slippery and reducing visibility. The weather conditions are believed to have contributed to the accident.

The investigation is ongoing, with a focus on determining the exact cause of the collision and any potential contributing factors such as distraction or impairment. Both drivers were cooperative during the initial investigation and provided statements detailing their recollection of events.

This report will be updated as more information becomes available.
