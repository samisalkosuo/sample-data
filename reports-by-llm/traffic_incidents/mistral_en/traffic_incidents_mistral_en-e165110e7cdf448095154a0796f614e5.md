Location: Lumijoki, Finland
Incident Number: TI-230125-001

On the morning of the 25th of January, 2023, at approximately 8:47 AM, a traffic incident occurred on Kauppakatu (Shopping Street), near the intersection with Miettisalmentie (Mietti Farm Road). The incident involved two vehicles: a silver Volvo XC60 with license plate F-XYZ123, driven by Mr. Jari Mattila, and a black Toyota Corolla with license plate O-ABC456, driven by Ms. Liisa Koskela.

Mr. Mattila, aged 48, was traveling southbound on Kauppakatu, while Ms. Koskela, aged 37, was heading east on Miettisalmentie. Both drivers reported that the roads were unusually slippery due to the icy conditions, which had been exacerbated by the overnight freeze.

According to eyewitness accounts, Mr. Mattila's Volvo lost traction as he approached the intersection, causing him to slide sideways into the path of Ms. Koskela's Corolla. The impact occurred at approximately 8:47 AM, with both vehicles sustaining significant damage.

Ms. Koskela and her passenger, Mr. Marko Miettinen, aged 62, were transported to Lumijoki Hospital for precautionary checks. Both reported minor injuries but are expected to make a full recovery. Mr. Mattila was uninjured but visibly shaken.

The road was closed for approximately two hours while the vehicles were removed and the scene was investigated. The incident is currently under investigation by the Lumijoki Police Department, with a focus on the icy road conditions and the role they may have played in the accident.

This report will be updated as more information becomes available.
