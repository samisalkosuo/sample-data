On the evening of October 7th, 2023, a traffic incident occurred on Kauppakatu (Shopping Street) near the intersection with Linnankatu (Castle Street), in the heart of Hailuoto. The incident involved two vehicles: a silver Toyota Corolla (license plate F-ABC 123) driven by Mr. Juhani Sariola, aged 45, and a black Volkswagen Golf (license plate X-DEF 456) driven by Ms. Liisa Mäki, aged 38.

At approximately 19:30, heavy rain began to fall, reducing visibility and making the roads slippery. Mr. Sariola was traveling south on Kauppakatu, while Ms. Mäki was heading east on Linnankatu. As they approached the intersection, both drivers failed to notice the red traffic light due to the poor weather conditions.

Mr. Sariola proceeded through the intersection, and as he did so, his vehicle collided with Ms. Mäki's, which had a green light. The impact caused both vehicles to spin out of control, blocking the intersection and causing minor injuries to Mr. Sariola and one passenger in Ms. Mäki's car, a 10-year-old child named Elias.

Upon arrival at the scene, emergency services found Mr. Sariola disoriented but otherwise unharmed. He was administered a breathalyzer test, which showed no signs of intoxication. Ms. Mäki and her passenger were taken to Hailuoto Hospital for treatment of minor injuries.

Witnesses at the scene reported that both drivers appeared to be distracted before the collision. A local resident, Mr. Antti Korpela, stated that he saw Mr. Sariola looking at his phone just before the accident. Another witness, Ms. Anna Lehto, confirmed that she saw Ms. Mäki adjusting her car's radio settings moments before the impact.

The vehicles sustained significant damage in the collision. The Toyota Corolla's front end was crushed, while the Volkswagen Golf's passenger side suffered extensive damage. Both vehicles were towed from the scene for further examination and repair.

This incident serves as a reminder to all drivers to remain vigilant, especially during adverse weather conditions. Distracted driving can have severe consequences, and it is essential to prioritize safety on our roads.

Investigation into this incident continues, with interviews being conducted with witnesses and further examination of the vehicles involved. The final report will be submitted to the Hailuoto Police Department for review and potential charges against the drivers.
