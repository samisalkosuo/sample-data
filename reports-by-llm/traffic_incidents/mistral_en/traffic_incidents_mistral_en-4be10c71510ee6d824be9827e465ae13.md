On the evening of August 29, 2023, at approximately 19:37 hours, a traffic incident occurred on Kauppakatu (Shopping Street) near the intersection with Mannerheimintie (Mannerheim Avenue), in Lappajärvi. The incident involved two vehicles: a silver Toyota Corolla (license plate F-ABC 123) driven by Mr. Juhani Siltala, aged 45, and a black Volkswagen Golf (license plate O-DEF 456) driven by Ms. Liisa Mäki, aged 38.

According to eyewitness accounts, both vehicles were traveling in opposite directions on Kauppakatu when the incident occurred. Mr. Siltala was approaching the intersection from Mannerheimintie, while Ms. Mäki was coming from Kauppakatu. The weather conditions at the time were dry but cold, with temperatures around 10°C (50°F), and visibility was good.

The preliminary investigation suggests that Mr. Siltala failed to stop at the red light at the intersection, proceeding into the path of Ms. Mäki's oncoming vehicle. The impact occurred near the crosswalk, causing both vehicles to spin out of control before coming to a halt.

Upon arrival, emergency services found no injuries reported among the drivers or passengers involved. However, both vehicles sustained significant damage. Mr. Siltala's Toyota Corolla had front-end damage, while Ms. Mäki's Volkswagen Golf suffered damage to its passenger side.

Witness statements indicate that several pedestrians were present at the crosswalk at the time of the incident but managed to avoid being struck by either vehicle. The road was closed for approximately one hour while the scene was secured and cleared, causing minor traffic disruptions in the area.

The investigation is ongoing, with a focus on determining the exact cause of the accident and any contributing factors. Both drivers have been cooperative and are undergoing routine drug and alcohol screening as part of the standard procedure following such incidents.

This report will be updated as more information becomes available.
