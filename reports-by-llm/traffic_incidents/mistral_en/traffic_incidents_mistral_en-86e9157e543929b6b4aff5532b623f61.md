On the morning of May 14th, 2023, at approximately 8:37 AM local time, a traffic incident occurred on Kauppakatu (Shopping Street) near the intersection with Linnankatu (Castle Street), in Ilmajoki. The incident involved two vehicles: a silver Toyota Corolla (license plate F-XYZ123) driven by Mr. Jukka Saarinen, aged 45, and a red Volkswagen Golf (license plate O-ABC456) driven by Ms. Liisa Mäki, aged 38.

According to eyewitness accounts, both vehicles were traveling in opposite directions on Kauppakatu when the incident occurred. Mr. Saarinen was approaching the intersection from Linnankatu while Ms. Mäki was coming from Kauppakatu. The weather conditions at the time were windy with gusts, which may have contributed to the accident.

The sequence of events, as gathered from eyewitness testimonies and physical evidence at the scene, is as follows:

1. Mr. Saarinen, while approaching the intersection, failed to notice that Ms. Mäki's Volkswagen Golf was turning left onto Linnankatu due to the poor visibility caused by the windy conditions.
2. Unable to stop in time, Mr. Saarinen's Toyota Corolla collided with the driver's side of Ms. Mäki's Volkswagen Golf. The impact caused both vehicles to spin out of control and come to a halt on the opposite sides of the intersection.
3. Witnesses immediately called emergency services, and traffic was diverted away from the scene until the arrival of the police and medical personnel.

Upon arrival, it was determined that Ms. Mäki had sustained minor injuries but refused further medical attention at the scene. Mr. Saarinen appeared unharmed. Both drivers were issued traffic violation notices for failure to yield right-of-way.

The Toyota Corolla sustained significant damage to its front bumper and left fender, while the Volkswagen Golf had damage to its driver's side door and fender. The vehicles were towed away from the scene for further inspection and repairs.

This incident serves as a reminder to all drivers to exercise caution, especially during adverse weather conditions, and to always yield right-of-way when necessary to ensure the safety of themselves and others on the road.
