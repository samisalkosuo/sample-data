Incident Description:

On August 28, 2023, at approximately 23:45, a traffic incident occurred on Kauppakatu, Multia. The incident involved two vehicles: a white 2018 Volvo XC60 (FIN-ABC 123) driven by Mr. Juhani Lehto and a grey 2015 Toyota Corolla (FIN-DEF 456) driven by Ms. Sanna Mäki.

Mr. Lehto was traveling southbound on Kauppakatu, while Ms. Mäki was heading northbound. Both drivers reported reduced visibility due to the mixed snow and rain conditions. As they approached each other near the intersection with Torikatu, Mr. Lehto attempted to make a left turn onto Torikatu but failed to yield right-of-way to Ms. Mäki.

The front of Ms. Mäki's Toyota Corolla collided with the driver's side of Mr. Lehto's Volvo XC60, causing both vehicles to spin out of control and come to a stop on the road. The impact caused significant damage to both vehicles, with the front end of Ms. Mäki's Toyota Corolla being severely crumpled, and the driver's side door of Mr. Lehto's Volvo XC60 sustaining extensive damage.

Upon arrival at the scene, emergency services found Mr. Marko Lehto and Ms. Emilia Mäki unharmed but shaken. Both drivers were administered breathalyzer tests, which showed no signs of intoxication. Witnesses Mr. Petri Niemi and Ms. Liisa Koskela confirmed the sequence of events and provided statements supporting Mr. Lehto's failure to yield right-of-way as the primary cause of the incident.

Conclusion:

The traffic incident on Kauppakatu, Multia, on August 28, 2023, was caused by Driver 1 (Mr. Juhani Lehto) failing to yield right-of-way while making a left turn onto Torikatu. The mixed snow and rain conditions contributed to reduced visibility, which may have exacerbated the incident. No injuries were reported, but both vehicles sustained significant damage. Further investigation will be conducted to determine any additional factors that may have contributed to the incident.
