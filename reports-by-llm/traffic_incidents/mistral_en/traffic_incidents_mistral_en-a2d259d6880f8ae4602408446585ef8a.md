Incident Narrative:
On the night of December 17th, 2022, at approximately 23:45, a three-vehicle collision occurred on Kauppakatu in Simo. The incident took place near the intersection with Linnankatu, where visibility was reduced due to blowing snow and windy conditions.

According to witness statements, Mr. Juhani Lehto (Vehicle 1) was traveling southbound on Kauppakatu at a speed that appeared to be above the posted limit. Ms. Sanna Mäki (Vehicle 2) was turning left from Linnankatu onto Kauppakatu, while Mr. Markku Koskela (Vehicle 3) was stationary in the northbound lanes of Kauppakatu, waiting for a green light to proceed.

As Ms. Mäki began her turn, she was unable to see oncoming traffic due to the poor visibility and gusty winds. Mr. Lehto's vehicle struck the rear of Vehicle 2, causing it to spin out of control and collide with Vehicle 3, which was stationary at the time.

The impact caused significant damage to all three vehicles. Mr. Lehto's Volvo sustained front-end damage, while Ms. Mäki's Toyota had extensive rear-end and side damage. Mr. Koskela's Ford Focus suffered minor damage from the collision with Vehicle 2.

Emergency services arrived at the scene promptly and assessed all parties involved for injuries. Fortunately, no serious injuries were reported. The road was closed for approximately two hours while the incident was investigated and cleared.

Conclusion:
The primary cause of this incident appears to be excessive speed on the part of Mr. Juhani Lehto, combined with poor visibility due to windy conditions and blowing snow. Charges are being considered against Mr. Lehto for reckless driving. The investigation is ongoing.
