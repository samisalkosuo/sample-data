Location: Nivala, Finland
Incident Number: TIR-230510-001

On the day of May 10th, 2023, at approximately 14:37 hours, a traffic incident occurred on Kauppakatu (Shopping Street) near the intersection with Linnankatu (Castle Street), in the heart of Nivala. The incident involved two vehicles: a silver Volvo V60 with license plate F-XYZ 123 and a black Volkswagen Golf GTI with license plate O-ABC 456.

Witnesses at the scene reported that the heavy rainfall had been ongoing for several hours, making visibility poor and roads slippery. The Volvo, driven by Mr. Juhani Mäki (38) of Kauppakatu 21, was traveling southbound on Kauppakatu when it hydroplaned due to the wet road conditions. As a result, the vehicle veered off the road and collided with the Volkswagen, which was stationary at the traffic light waiting for the green signal. The Volkswagen was being driven by Ms. Sanna Koskela (27) of Linnankatu 35.

Upon arrival, emergency services found both drivers uninjured but shaken up from the incident. Mr. Mäki admitted to losing control of his vehicle due to the heavy rain and slick roads. Ms. Koskela confirmed that she had been stationary at the time of the collision.

The Volvo sustained significant front-end damage, with the bumper and grille being crushed against the radiator. The Volkswagen's passenger side received minor scratches and dents from the impact. Both vehicles were towed away from the scene for further inspection and repairs.

Traffic was diverted through alternate routes during the cleanup process, which took approximately one hour to complete. The incident serves as a reminder to drivers to exercise caution when driving in adverse weather conditions and to maintain a safe following distance from other vehicles.
