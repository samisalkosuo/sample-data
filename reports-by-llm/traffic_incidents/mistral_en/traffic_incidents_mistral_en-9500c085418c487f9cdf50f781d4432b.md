Weather Conditions: Clear and Sunny

Upon arrival at the scene, I found three vehicles involved in a collision on Mannerheimintie (State Highway 1), near the intersection with Kauppakatu (Main Street). The incident occurred approximately 300 meters north of the Salo City Library (Address: Kauppakatu 24).

Vehicle 1, a silver Volvo V60 with license plate FIN-ABC 123, was traveling southbound on Mannerheimintie. The driver, Mr. Juhani Särkijärvi (DOB: 01.01.1985), and his passenger, Ms. Liisa Koskinen (DOB: 01.02.1986), were both uninjured but visibly shaken.

Vehicle 2, a red Toyota Corolla with license plate FIN-DEF 456, was traveling northbound on Mannerheimintie and attempted to make a left turn onto Kauppakatu at the time of the collision. The driver, Mr. Marko Hämäläinen (DOB: 01.03.1987), and his passenger, Ms. Sanna Niemelä (DOB: 01.04.1988), were both transported to Salo Central Hospital for precautionary checks.

Vehicle 3, a black Audi A4 with license plate FIN-GHI 789, was stationary on the side of the road due to a mechanical failure. The driver, Ms. Anna Mäkelä (DOB: 01.05.1989), had already exited her vehicle and was standing near the curb when I arrived at the scene.

Witness statements suggest that Mr. Hämäläinen failed to notice Vehicle 3 on the side of the road due to poor visibility caused by the darkness. As a result, he turned left into the path of Vehicle 1, causing both vehicles to collide. The impact forced Vehicle 1 onto the sidewalk, where it struck a street lamp, causing minor damage but no injuries.

The clear and sunny weather conditions contributed to good visibility for all parties involved, with the exception of the poor lighting in the area surrounding Vehicle 3. Road conditions were dry and well-maintained at the time of the incident.

Upon further investigation, it was determined that Mr. Hämäläinen had been driving under the influence of alcohol, which contributed to his failure to notice Vehicle 3 on the side of the road. He has since been charged with Driving Under the Influence (DUI) and Reckless Driving.

This report is based on my observations at the scene, witness statements, and subsequent investigations. I will continue to gather evidence and interview parties involved in order to build a comprehensive case against Mr. Hämäläinen.
