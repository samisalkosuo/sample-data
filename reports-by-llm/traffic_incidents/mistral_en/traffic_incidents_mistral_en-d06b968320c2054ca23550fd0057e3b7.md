On the evening of January 18th, 2025, at approximately 19:37 hours, a four-vehicle collision occurred on Mäkelänkatu (Mäkelä Street), near the intersection with Kauppakatu (Shopping Street) in Lapua, Finland.

The incident involved the following vehicles:

1. Vehicle A - A 2024 Volvo XC90 (license plate F-XYZ 123) driven by Mr. Juhani Mäkelä, aged 45, and carrying three passengers: Mrs. Sari Mäkelä, aged 42, and their two children, aged 8 and 10.

2. Vehicle B - A 2023 Toyota Corolla (license plate F-ABC 987) driven by Ms. Liisa Kauppi, aged 38, with no passengers.

3. Vehicle C - A 2025 Ford Mustang (license plate F-DEF 456) driven by Mr. Eero Pentti, aged 22, and carrying one passenger, Ms. Emilia Pentti, aged 19.

4. Vehicle D - A 2023 Mercedes-Benz E-Class (license plate F-GHI 789) driven by Mr. Marko Hämäläinen, aged 52, with no passengers.

According to eyewitness accounts and the investigation conducted at the scene, the foggy weather conditions significantly reduced visibility, making it difficult for drivers to navigate the road. The incident began when Vehicle A, driven by Mr. Mäkelä, slowed down due to the poor visibility as they approached the intersection from Mäkelänkatu.

Simultaneously, Vehicle B, driven by Ms. Kauppi, failed to notice the reduced speed of Vehicle A and collided with its rear end. The impact caused Vehicle A to swerve into the oncoming lane, where it was struck by Vehicle C, driven by Mr. Pentti. The force of this collision sent Vehicle A spinning back onto Mäkelänkatu, where it was subsequently hit by Vehicle D, driven by Mr. Hämäläinen.

Upon arrival at the scene, emergency services found all parties involved to be conscious and responsive. No life-threatening injuries were reported; however, several individuals sustained minor to moderate injuries and were transported to the local hospital for further evaluation and treatment.

The vehicles involved in the collision suffered significant damage. Vehicle A's rear end was severely crushed, while its front end sustained extensive scrapes and dents from the subsequent collisions. Vehicles B, C, and D also displayed noticeable damage, including crumpled fenders, shattered headlights, and broken windshields.

The road was closed for approximately three hours to allow for the removal of the damaged vehicles, investigation by local authorities, and cleanup of debris. The incident serves as a reminder of the importance of driving cautiously in adverse weather conditions and maintaining a safe following distance from other vehicles.

This report is based on eyewitness accounts, physical evidence at the scene, and interviews with the drivers involved. Further investigations may be conducted to determine the exact cause of the collision and any potential contributing factors.
