On the day of July 16, 2025, at approximately 14:37 hours, a multi-vehicle collision occurred on Kauppakatu (Shopping Street) near the intersection with Mannerheimintie (Mannerheim Avenue), in the heart of Vaala. The incident involved three vehicles and resulted in minor injuries to several individuals.

The following is a detailed account of the events leading up to the accident:

14:35 hours - A white Volvo XC90, driven by Mr. Juhani Lehto (license plate F-ABC 123), was traveling southbound on Kauppakatu. Mr. Lehto, a 48-year-old resident of Vaala, was accompanied by his wife, Mrs. Sari Lehto (age 45).

Simultaneously, a black Mercedes E-Class (license plate F-DEF 456), driven by Ms. Liisa Mäki (age 32), was traveling northbound on Kauppakatu. Ms. Mäki, a local businesswoman, had a passenger, Mr. Petri Koskela (age 30).

14:36 hours - As both vehicles approached the intersection with Mannerheimintie, mixed snow and rain began to fall, reducing visibility and causing slippery road conditions.

14:37 hours - At the same time, a red Toyota Corolla (license plate F-GHI 789), driven by Mr. Eero Saarinen (age 25), was stopped at the traffic light on Mannerheimintie, waiting to turn left onto Kauppakatu.

14:37 hours - Due to the adverse weather conditions and reduced visibility, Mr. Lehto failed to notice the red Toyota Corolla as it began its left turn from Mannerheimintie onto Kauppakatu. As a result, the Volvo XC90 collided with the side of the Toyota Corolla.

14:38 hours - The impact caused the Toyota Corolla to spin out of control and collide with the Mercedes E-Class, which was unable to avoid the accident due to the poor road conditions.

Upon arrival at the scene, emergency services found all parties involved in the collision unharmed but shaken. Mr. Lehto and his wife sustained minor injuries, as did Ms. Mäki's passenger, Mr. Koskela. They were transported to Vaala Hospital for further evaluation and treatment.

The vehicles involved in the incident suffered significant damage. The Volvo XC90 sustained damage to its front left fender and side door, while the Mercedes E-Class had damage to its front right bumper and passenger side door. The Toyota Corolla was severely damaged, with extensive damage to both the driver's and passenger's sides.

Witnesses at the scene reported that the adverse weather conditions played a significant role in the accident, as visibility was reduced, and the roads were slippery. The incident is currently under investigation by the Vaala Police Department.
