 Title: Traffic Incident Report - 09.06.2025, Kristiinankaupunki, Finland

On the morning of June 9th, 2025, at approximately 8:37 AM local time, a traffic incident occurred on Helsinginkatu, a major thoroughfare in the heart of Kristiinankaupunki. The incident involved two vehicles: a silver Volvo XC60 with license plate F-ABC 123 and a black Mercedes E-Class with license plate O-DEF 456.

The Volvo, driven by Mr. Jari Mäki (age 42, resident of Helsinginkatu 78), was traveling southbound from the city center towards the outskirts. The Mercedes, driven by Ms. Liisa Koskela (age 35, resident of Kauppakatu 90), was heading northbound on the same street.

According to eyewitness accounts, both drivers were adhering to the speed limit in the snowy conditions. However, as they approached the intersection with Mannerheimintie, Ms. Koskela's Mercedes began to slide due to the icy road surface. The vehicle lost control and drifted into the opposite lane, colliding with Mr. Mäki's Volvo.

The impact caused significant damage to both vehicles. The front end of the Mercedes was severely crumpled, while the Volvo sustained damage to its passenger side. Both drivers and their respective passengers—Ms. Koskela's husband, Mr. Juhani Koskela (age 40), and Mr. Mäki's daughter, Miss Emilia Mäki (age 12)—were unharmed but shaken by the incident.

Emergency services arrived at the scene promptly and assessed the situation. The damaged vehicles were towed away, and the road was cleared of debris. Traffic flow was temporarily disrupted, but normal operations resumed shortly after 9:50 AM.

The police are currently investigating the incident, focusing on the role of weather conditions and road maintenance in the accident. Both drivers have been cooperative and provided statements detailing their actions leading up to the collision. No charges have been filed at this time.

This report is preliminary and subject to further investigation. Updates will be provided as more information becomes available.
