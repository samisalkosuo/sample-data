Location: Kotka, Finland
Incident Number: KTK-240528-001

On the day of May 28th, 2024, at approximately 14:37 hours, a traffic incident occurred on Vesikko Street near the intersection with Sapokka Road in Kotka. The incident involved two vehicles: a silver Volkswagen Golf TSI bearing Finnish license plate FAB-123M and a black Toyota Corolla Hybrid with the license plate KZY-456N.

According to eyewitness accounts, the driver of the Volkswagen Golf, Mr. Jukka Lehto (age 38, resident of Vesikko Street), was traveling southbound on Vesikko Street at a speed estimated between 60-70 km/h. Simultaneously, the Toyota Corolla, driven by Ms. Liisa Mäki (age 42, resident of Sapokka Road), was turning left from Sapokka Road onto Vesikko Street.

The overcast weather conditions and poor visibility due to rain showers contributed to the incident. Witnesses reported that Mr. Lehto failed to notice Ms. Mäki's Corolla as it began its turn, resulting in a collision between the two vehicles. The impact caused both vehicles to spin out of control before coming to a halt on the southbound lane of Vesikko Street.

Upon arrival at the scene, emergency services found no injuries among the drivers or passengers involved. Both Mr. Lehto and Ms. Mäki were cooperative and provided statements regarding the incident.

A preliminary investigation revealed that Mr. Lehto's Volkswagen Golf sustained significant front-end damage, with the bumper and grille being crushed against the radiator. The Toyota Corolla, on the other hand, suffered damage to its passenger side, including a dented door and shattered side window.

The vehicles were towed away from the scene for further examination and assessment of damages. Traffic was diverted through alternate routes during the cleanup process, which took approximately two hours to complete.

This incident serves as a reminder to all drivers to exercise caution, especially in adverse weather conditions and when approaching intersections. The investigation is ongoing, with potential charges being considered against Mr. Lehto for failure to yield at an intersection.
