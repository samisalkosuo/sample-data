 Title: Traffic Incident Report
Date: May 25, 2024
Location: Vantaa, Finland
Incident Number: VA-240525-1234

On the evening of May 25, 2024, at approximately 19:37 hours, a traffic incident occurred on Tikkurila Road (Tie 618) near the intersection with Kaukokoski Street (Kaukokoskenkatu), in Vantaa. The incident involved two vehicles: a silver Toyota Corolla (license plate F-ABC 123) driven by Mr. Jari Mäkelä, aged 45, and a black Volkswagen Golf (license plate O-DEF 456) driven by Ms. Liisa Koskela, aged 38.

According to eyewitness accounts, both vehicles were traveling in the same direction when the incident occurred. Mr. Mäkelä, who was driving the Toyota Corolla, lost control of his vehicle due to mixed snow and rain conditions on the road. The car slid onto the opposite lane, colliding with Ms. Koskela's Volkswagen Golf.

The first witness, Mr. Marko Saari (address: Kaukokoski 2A, Vantaa), reported that he saw the Toyota Corolla skid across the road before the collision. Another witness, Ms. Sanna Lappalainen (address: Tikkurila Road 105, Vantaa), stated that she heard a loud impact and immediately stopped her car to assist.

Upon arrival at the scene, emergency services found both vehicles severely damaged but with no immediate signs of life-threatening injuries for either driver or passengers. Mr. Mäkelä and Ms. Koskela were transported to Tikkurila Hospital for further evaluation and treatment.

The road was closed for approximately two hours while the incident was investigated and cleared. The Finnish Weather Service reported that the mixed snow and rain conditions had created slippery roads, which likely contributed to the accident.

This report will be forwarded to the relevant authorities for further investigation and potential charges against Mr. Mäkelä for reckless driving.
