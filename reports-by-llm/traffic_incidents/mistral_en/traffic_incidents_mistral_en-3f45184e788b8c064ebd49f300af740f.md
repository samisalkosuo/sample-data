Incident Number: LIM-250518-001

On the morning of May 18th, 2025, at approximately 07:45, a four-vehicle collision occurred on Kauppakatu (Shopping Street), near the intersection with Mannerheimintie (Mannerheim Avenue) in Liminka. The incident involved the following vehicles and parties:

1. Vehicle A - A white 2023 Volvo XC90 (license plate F-ABC 123) driven by Mr. Juhani Mäki, aged 45, of Kauppakatu 28, Liminka.
2. Vehicle B - A black 2024 Toyota Corolla Hybrid (license plate X-DEF 456) driven by Ms. Sanna Koskela, aged 32, of Mannerheimintie 17, Liminka.
3. Vehicle C - A red 2022 Ford Mustang Mach-E (license plate G-HIJ 789) driven by Mr. Marko Saari, aged 28, of Kauppakatu 45, Liminka.
4. Vehicle D - A blue 2021 Mercedes-Benz E-Class (license plate J-KLM 901) with no identified driver at the time of the incident.

Witness statements suggest that Mr. Mäki was approaching the intersection from Kauppakatu, while Ms. Koskela was traveling on Mannerheimintie. The foggy conditions and reduced visibility may have contributed to the initial collision between Vehicles A and B. Following this impact, Vehicle C, which was following closely behind Ms. Koskela, collided with the rear of her vehicle. As a result, Vehicle D, traveling in the opposite direction on Kauppakatu, swerved to avoid the accident scene but ended up hitting the side of Vehicle B.

Upon arrival at the scene, emergency services found that all vehicles sustained significant damage. Mr. Mäki and Ms. Koskela reported minor injuries, while no other parties involved in the incident were physically harmed. The road was closed for approximately two hours to allow for the removal of debris and investigation of the accident.

The foggy weather conditions and reduced visibility are believed to have played a significant role in this incident. Road maintenance crews had been notified of the poor weather conditions earlier in the day, but the rapid onset of fog may have made it difficult for them to address the issue before the collision occurred.

This report will be forwarded to the Liminka Traffic Department for further investigation and potential charges against any parties involved in the incident. The case number for this matter is LIM-250518-001.
