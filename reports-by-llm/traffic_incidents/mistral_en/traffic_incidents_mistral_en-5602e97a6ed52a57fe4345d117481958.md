 Title: Traffic Incident Report - Mänttä-Vilppula, Finland - 29.05.2025 - Morning Hours

Incident Summary:
A multiple vehicle collision occurred on Kauppakatu (Shopping Street) in the heart of Mänttä-Vilppula, Finland, during the morning hours of May 29th, 2025. The incident involved five vehicles and resulted in minor injuries to several individuals.

Incident Timeline:
1. At approximately 8:30 AM, a heavy downpour began, causing reduced visibility on Kauppakatu.
2. Approximately two minutes later, a silver Volvo XC90 (license plate F-ABC 123) driven by Mr. Juhani Lehto (age 45, resident of Linnankatu 27) was traveling southbound at an estimated speed of 60 km/h.
3. Simultaneously, a black Mercedes E-Class (license plate O-DEF 456) driven by Ms. Sanna Mäki (age 32, resident of Kauppakatu 45) was turning left from Linnankatu onto Kauppakatu, also traveling at approximately 60 km/h.
4. Due to the heavy rain and reduced visibility, Mr. Lehto failed to notice Ms. Mäki's turn signal and collided with her vehicle.
5. The impact caused both vehicles to spin out of control, with the Volvo XC90 veering onto the northbound lane and colliding with a red Toyota Corolla (license plate G-HIJ 789) driven by Mr. Markku Koskela (age 28, resident of Kauppakatu 34).
6. The Toyota Corolla was then pushed into the path of an oncoming blue Ford Focus (license plate J-KLM 901), driven by Ms. Liisa Niemi (age 52, resident of Linnankatu 18).
7. Finally, a green Opel Astra (license plate P-QRS 321) swerved to avoid the collision but ended up hitting a stationary traffic sign on the side of the road.

Upon arrival at the scene, emergency services found all parties involved in the incident unharmed but shaken. Mr. Lehto and Ms. Mäki were treated for minor cuts and bruises, while Mr. Koskela complained of neck pain. No other injuries were reported.

The heavy rain and reduced visibility are believed to have contributed significantly to the accident. The road conditions were slippery, making it difficult for drivers to maintain control of their vehicles.

The incident caused significant traffic disruptions in the area, with Kauppakatu being closed for several hours while the vehicles were removed and the scene was cleared. The vehicles involved sustained varying degrees of damage, with the Volvo XC90 and Mercedes E-Class suffering the most extensive damage.

This report is preliminary and further investigation will be conducted to determine the exact cause of the accident and any potential contributing factors. All parties involved have been advised to contact their insurance providers regarding the incident.
