 Title: Traffic Incident Report
Date: 01.07.2024
Location: Uusikaarlepyy, Finland
Incident Number: 24-3567

On the night of July 1st, 2024, at approximately 23:30 local time, a traffic incident occurred on Kauppakatu (Shopping Street) near the intersection with Mannerheimintie (Mannerheim Road), in the heart of Uusikaarlepyy. The incident involved two vehicles: a silver 2023 Volvo XC60 with license plate FIN-ABC123, driven by Mr. Jukka Saari, and a black 2024 Toyota Corolla Hybrid with license plate FIN-DEF456, driven by Ms. Liisa M채ki.

According to eyewitness accounts, both vehicles were traveling in opposite directions on Kauppakatu when the incident occurred. Mr. Saari, 35, a local resident of Kauppakatu 21, was reportedly driving at an estimated speed of 60 km/h in a 50 km/h zone. Ms. M채ki, 42, a resident of Mannerheimintie 37, was traveling at the same speed limit.

As Mr. Saari approached the intersection from Kauppakatu, he failed to notice the oncoming Corolla due to poor visibility caused by the nighttime conditions and insufficient street lighting in that area. Ms. M채ki, who had the right of way, was unable to avoid a collision as a result.

The impact occurred at the center of the intersection, causing both vehicles to spin out of control before coming to a halt on the opposite sides of the road. The Volvo sustained significant front-end damage, while the Corolla's rear end was severely damaged.

Upon arrival, emergency services found no injuries among the drivers or passengers involved. Both Mr. Saari and Ms. M채ki were cooperative and provided statements to the investigating officer. Witnesses at the scene corroborated their accounts of the incident.

The road was closed for approximately two hours while the vehicles were removed and the scene was investigated. The incident serves as a reminder to all drivers to adhere to speed limits, especially in poor visibility conditions, and to remain vigilant at intersections.

This report is preliminary and subject to further investigation by the Uusikaarlepyy Police Department's Traffic Unit.
