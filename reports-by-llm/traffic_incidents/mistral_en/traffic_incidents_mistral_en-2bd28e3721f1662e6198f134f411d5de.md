 Title: Traffic Incident Report

Date: December 28, 2023
Location: Forssa, Finland
Incident Number: 231228-0045

On the day of December 28, 2023, at approximately 14:37 hours, a traffic incident occurred on Mäkelänkatu (Mäkelä Street) near the intersection with Kauppakatu (Shopping Street), in the heart of Forssa. The incident involved two vehicles: a silver Toyota Corolla (license plate F-ABC 123) driven by Mr. Juhani Särkijärvi, aged 45, and a black Volkswagen Golf (license plate F-DEF 456) driven by Ms. Liisa Mäkeläinen, aged 38.

According to eyewitness accounts, both vehicles were traveling in opposite directions on Mäkelänkatu when the incident occurred. The thunderstorm that had been brewing throughout the day reached its peak at the time of the accident, causing reduced visibility and slippery road conditions.

Mr. Särkijärvi, who was driving the Toyota Corolla, reportedly lost control of his vehicle due to the adverse weather conditions. The car hydroplaned across the wet pavement, skidding sideways into the path of Ms. Mäkeläinen's oncoming Volkswagen Golf. Despite attempting to brake and swerve to avoid a collision, Ms. Mäkeläinen was unable to prevent her vehicle from striking the Corolla at high speed.

The impact caused significant damage to both vehicles. The front end of the Toyota Corolla was crumpled, with the airbags deploying upon impact. The Volkswagen Golf sustained damage to its passenger side, with the door being dented and the side mirror torn off.

Emergency services arrived at the scene within minutes, finding both drivers uninjured but shaken. Mr. Särkijärvi was treated for minor cuts on his hands caused by breaking the car's windshield during the collision. Ms. Mäkeläinen was visibly distressed but otherwise unhurt.

Witnesses at the scene provided statements to the police, corroborating the events leading up to the accident. The road was closed for approximately two hours while the vehicles were towed away and the scene was cleared.

The incident is currently under investigation by the Forssa Police Department's traffic unit. Preliminary findings suggest that the adverse weather conditions played a significant role in the accident, with both drivers being cited for driving too fast for the prevailing conditions.

This report will be updated as more information becomes available.
