 Title: Traffic Incident Report - 11.11.2023, Ranua, Finland

On the night of November 11th, 2023, at approximately 23:45 local time, a four-vehicle collision occurred on Kauppakatu (Shop Street), near the intersection with Linnankatu (Castle Street) in the heart of Ranua municipality.

The incident involved the following vehicles:

1. A silver Volkswagen Golf TSI, license plate F-ABC 123, driven by Mr. Juhani Mäki (45), with a passenger, Ms. Sanna Niemi (30).
2. A black Mercedes E-Class, license plate XYZ 345, driven by Mr. Markku Koskela (52), with no passengers.
3. A red Toyota Corolla Hybrid, license plate DEF 789, driven by Ms. Liisa Hämäläinen (28), with a passenger, Mr. Eero Saari (30).
4. A blue Ford Focus ST, license plate GHI 456, driven by Mr. Petri Lappalainen (35), with no passengers.

According to eyewitness accounts, the heavy rain that had been falling throughout the evening made visibility poor, and the wet roads contributed to slippery conditions. The incident began when Mr. Mäki's Volkswagen, traveling south on Kauppakatu, hydroplaned due to the heavy rain, causing him to lose control and veer into the northbound lane.

Mr. Koskela, driving the Mercedes, was unable to avoid a collision with the Volkswagen and struck it head-on. The impact caused both vehicles to spin out of control, blocking the southbound lanes. Meanwhile, Ms. Hämäläinen, in her Toyota Corolla, attempted to swerve to avoid the accident but ended up colliding with the rear of Mr. Koskela's Mercedes.

Mr. Lappalainen, driving the Ford Focus ST, was approaching the intersection from Linnankatu when he saw the chaotic scene unfolding before him. Unable to stop in time, he crashed into the rear of Ms. Hämäläinen's Toyota Corolla.

Emergency services arrived on the scene within minutes and found all parties involved to be conscious but shaken. Mr. Mäki and Ms. Niemi sustained minor injuries, while Mr. Koskela complained of neck pain. Neither Ms. Hämäläinen nor Mr. Saari reported any injuries, and Mr. Lappalainen remained unharmed.

The vehicles involved in the collision suffered significant damage. The Volkswagen's front end was severely crumpled, while the Mercedes sustained damage to both its front and rear ends. The Toyota Corolla had noticeable damage to its rear bumper and trunk, and the Ford Focus ST's front bumper was pushed in.

The road was closed for several hours while the vehicles were removed and the scene was investigated by local authorities. Charges are pending further investigation into the cause of the accident and any potential contributing factors, such as speeding or impaired driving.

This report is preliminary and subject to change as the investigation continues.
