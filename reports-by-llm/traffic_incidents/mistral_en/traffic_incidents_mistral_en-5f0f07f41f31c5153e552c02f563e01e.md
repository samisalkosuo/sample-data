 Title: Traffic Incident Report

Date: March 10, 2024
Location: Kruunupyy, Finland
Incident Number: 23456-24

On the evening of March 10, 2024, at approximately 19:37 hours, a traffic incident occurred on Vuokkiniementie (Highway 8), near the intersection with Kauppakatu (Main Street) in Kruunupyy. The incident involved two vehicles: a silver Toyota Corolla (license plate F-ABC 123) driven by Mr. Jukka Saarinen, aged 45, and a black Volkswagen Golf (license plate X-DEF 456) driven by Ms. Liisa Mäki, aged 38.

According to eyewitness accounts, both vehicles were traveling in the same direction when the incident occurred. Mr. Saarinen, who was driving the Toyota Corolla, lost control of his vehicle due to slippery road conditions caused by snowfall. The car skidded across the road and collided with Ms. Mäki's Volkswagen Golf, which was unable to avoid the collision due to the poor weather conditions.

The first emergency services arrived at the scene at 19:42 hours. Both drivers were uninjured but shaken up by the incident. The Toyota Corolla sustained significant front-end damage, while the Volkswagen Golf had minor rear damage.

Witness statements suggest that Mr. Saarinen was driving at a reasonable speed for the conditions, but his vehicle may have been affected by black ice on the road. Ms. Mäki also reported driving cautiously due to the snowy weather. The road was treated with salt and grit prior to the incident, but the snowfall had reduced its effectiveness.

The incident caused a temporary closure of Vuokkiniementie in both directions while the vehicles were removed and the scene was cleared. The road reopened at 20:35 hours. No further incidents were reported in the area following this incident.

This report is preliminary and subject to further investigation by the Kruunupyy Traffic Police Department.
