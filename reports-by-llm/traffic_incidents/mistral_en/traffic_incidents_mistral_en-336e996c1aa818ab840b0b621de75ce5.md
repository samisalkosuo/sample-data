On the day of April 12, 2024, at approximately 15:37 local time in Haapavesi, Finland, a traffic incident occurred involving two vehicles. The incident took place on Kauppakatu (Shopping Street), near the intersection with Linnankatu (Castle Street).

2. Vehicle 2 - A red 2022 Toyota Corolla, license plate number O-DEF 456, driven by Ms. Sanna Koivisto, age 32, of Linnankatu 17, Haapavesi.

Witness Accounts:
A local resident, Mr. Eero Saari, who was walking his dog on Kauppakatu at the time of the incident, provided a statement to the police. He reported seeing Vehicle 1 traveling southbound on Kauppakatu and Vehicle 2 approaching from Linnankatu, intending to turn left onto Kauppakatu.

According to Mr. Saari's account, as Vehicle 2 began its turn, it was struck by Vehicle 1, which had failed to stop at the red light at the intersection. The impact caused both vehicles to spin out of control and come to a halt on the opposite sides of the intersection.

Road and Weather Conditions:
The road surface was wet due to recent rainfall, and gusts of wind made visibility difficult for drivers. The wind had been blowing from the west-northwest at approximately 25 km/h (15 mph) with occasional gusts reaching up to 40 km/h (25 mph).

Damage Descriptions:
Vehicle 1 sustained significant front-end damage, including a collapsed passenger side wheel and extensive damage to the bumper, grille, and hood. The airbags deployed, and Mr. Mäki was observed with minor injuries.

Vehicle 2 suffered damage to its driver's side, including a crumpled door, broken side mirror, and scratches along the passenger side. Ms. Koivisto reported no injuries but appeared shaken up.

Conclusion:
The preliminary investigation indicates that the primary cause of this incident was the failure of Mr. Juhani Mäki to stop at a red light, resulting in a collision with Vehicle 2 as it turned left onto Kauppakatu. Both drivers were issued traffic violation citations for their roles in the accident.

This report is based on witness statements and initial observations at the scene. A more thorough investigation will be conducted to determine the exact cause of the incident, including any contributing factors such as visibility or road conditions.
