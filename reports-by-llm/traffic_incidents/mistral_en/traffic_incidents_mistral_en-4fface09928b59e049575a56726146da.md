Incident Number: TI-2025-INA-003

On the evening of February 19, 2025, at approximately 18:47 hours, a traffic incident occurred on Aatami Road (B96) near the intersection with Kultahonka Street (C10), in Inari. The incident involved two vehicles: a silver Toyota RAV4 (license plate F-XYZ 123) driven by Mr. Jukka Saarinen, aged 35, and a black Volkswagen Golf (license plate O-ABC 987) driven by Ms. Liisa M채ki, aged 42.

According to eyewitness accounts, both vehicles were traveling in opposite directions when the incident occurred. Mr. Saarinen was approaching the intersection from Kultahonka Street, while Ms. M채ki was on Aatami Road. The weather conditions at the time were unfavorable, with a severe thunderstorm causing heavy rain and reduced visibility.

The first eyewitness, Mr. Eero Lappalainen (witness statement #1), who resides at 23 Kultahonka Street, reported seeing Ms. M채ki's Volkswagen Golf approaching the intersection from Aatami Road. As she entered the intersection, her vehicle was struck by Mr. Saarinen's Toyota RAV4, which had failed to stop at the red light due to the poor visibility caused by the storm.

The impact of the collision sent both vehicles spinning out of control. The Volkswagen Golf came to rest on the southwest corner of the intersection, while the Toyota RAV4 ended up on the northeast side. Both drivers and passengers were wearing seatbelts, and no one sustained life-threatening injuries.

Ms. M채ki's Volkswagen Golf suffered significant front-end damage, with the bumper and hood crumpled. The Toyota RAV4 had damage to its passenger side, including a shattered window and door. Both vehicles were towed from the scene for further examination and assessment of repair costs.

The Inari Police Department would like to remind drivers to exercise caution during adverse weather conditions and always obey traffic signals. This incident serves as a reminder that the actions of one driver can have far-reaching consequences, and it is essential to prioritize safety on our roads.

This report will be forwarded to the Traffic Accident Investigation Unit for further analysis and determination of any potential charges or citations.
