The incident occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Torikatu, near the city center. Witnesses report that a four-vehicle collision took place involving the following vehicles:

1. Vehicle 1 (V1): A silver 2018 Volvo XC60 with Finnish license plate FAB-123A, driven by Mr. Juhani Mäki (45) and carrying two passengers, Ms. Sanna Niemi (32) and Mr. Eero Koskela (37).

2. Vehicle 2 (V2): A red 2019 Toyota Corolla with Finnish license plate KLW-456B, driven by Ms. Liisa Lappalainen (38) and carrying one passenger, Mr. Jari Saarinen (42).

3. Vehicle 3 (V3): A black 2017 Mercedes-Benz C-Class with Finnish license plate OLH-789C, driven by Mr. Marko Hämäläinen (52) and carrying no passengers.

4. Vehicle 4 (V4): A blue 2016 Ford Focus with Finnish license plate TYT-321D, driven by Ms. Anna Lehtonen (28) and carrying one passenger, Mr. Mikko Kivinen (25).

According to eyewitness accounts, V1 was traveling south on Kauppakatu while V2 was heading east on Torikatu. Both drivers reportedly failed to stop at the red light at the intersection, resulting in a T-bone collision between V1 and V2. The impact caused V1 to spin out of control and collide with V3, which was stationary at a parking spot on the southwest corner of the intersection. V4, traveling east on Torikatu behind V2, was unable to stop in time and rear-ended V1.

Upon arrival, emergency services found all parties involved conscious but shaken. Mr. Mäki, Ms. Niemi, and Mr. Koskela sustained minor injuries, while Ms. Lappalainen and Mr. Saarinen were unharmed. Ms. Lehtonen and Mr. Kivinen were not injured in the collision.

Damage to the vehicles was significant, with V1 sustaining extensive front-end damage, V2 having severe damage to both the driver's side and front end, V3 showing minor damage from being struck by V1, and V4 experiencing rear-end damage.

The intersection was closed for approximately two hours while emergency services attended to the scene and traffic was diverted. The incident is currently under investigation by local authorities.
