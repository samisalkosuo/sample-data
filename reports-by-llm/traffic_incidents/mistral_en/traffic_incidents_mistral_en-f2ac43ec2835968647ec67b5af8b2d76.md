On the evening of June 24, 2025, at approximately 19:37 hours, a multiple vehicle collision occurred on Kauppakatu (Shopping Street) near the intersection with Linnankatu (Castle Street), in Pieksämäki. The incident involved three vehicles and resulted in minor injuries to several individuals.

The following is a detailed account of the events leading up to the accident:

1. Vehicle 1 (Volvo XC90, license plate F-ABC 123) was traveling southbound on Kauppakatu at an estimated speed of 50 km/h. The driver, Mr. Jari Mäki (45 years old), had a passenger, Ms. Liisa Mäki (42 years old).

2. Vehicle 2 (Toyota Corolla, license plate F-DEF 456) was parked illegally on the eastern side of Kauppakatu, near the intersection with Linnankatu. The driver, Mr. Markku Saari (38 years old), had stepped out of his vehicle to retrieve an item from the trunk. Witness statements indicate that he did not use any safety measures such as activating the hazard lights or setting up warning triangles.

3. Vehicle 3 (Audi A4, license plate F-GHI 789) was traveling northbound on Kauppakatu at an estimated speed of 60 km/h. The driver, Ms. Anna Lehto (35 years old), had a passenger, Mr. Petri Lehto (12 years old).

As Vehicle 1 approached the intersection, the foggy conditions reduced visibility significantly. Despite this, Mr. Mäki failed to notice that Vehicle 2 was parked illegally and obstructing part of the road. As a result, he was unable to stop in time and collided with the rear of Vehicle 2. The impact caused Vehicle 2 to be pushed into the path of oncoming traffic, where it was struck by Vehicle 3.

The collision resulted in minor injuries for Mr. Mäki, Ms. Lehto, and her son, Mr. Petri Lehto. All parties involved were transported to Pieksämäki Hospital for treatment and evaluation.

Upon arrival at the scene, emergency services found that Vehicle 1 sustained damage to its front bumper and grille, while Vehicle 2 had extensive rear-end damage and was rendered inoperable. Vehicle 3 suffered minor damage to its front bumper and headlights.

The incident caused significant traffic disruptions for approximately one hour as emergency services attended to the scene and cleared debris from the roadway. The Pieksämäki Police Department is currently investigating the accident, with a focus on determining whether any traffic laws were violated by any of the parties involved.

This report will be updated as more information becomes available.
