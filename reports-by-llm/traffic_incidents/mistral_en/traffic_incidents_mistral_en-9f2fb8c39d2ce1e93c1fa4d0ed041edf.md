 Title: Traffic Incident Report

Date: 25th December 2024
Location: Föglö, Finland
Incident Number: 241225-FGL-001

On the evening of December 25th, 2024, a traffic incident occurred on Vuosaarenkatu, a main road in the municipality of Föglö. The incident involved two vehicles: a silver Volvo XC90 (license plate FGL-ABC 123) driven by Mr. Juhani Mäki (age 45, resident of Vuosaari 2A) and a black Mercedes-Benz CLS (license plate FGL-DEF 456) driven by Ms. Sanna Koivisto (age 32, resident of Kustavi 3B).

At approximately 19:30, Mr. Mäki was traveling southbound on Vuosaarenkatu at a speed estimated to be around 60 km/h. The road conditions were treacherous due to icy surfaces, making it difficult for drivers to maintain control of their vehicles. As he approached the intersection with Kustavi Road, Mr. Mäki lost control of his vehicle and began to slide sideways across the road.

Simultaneously, Ms. Koivisto was traveling northbound on Vuosaarenkatu at a similar speed. Unable to react in time due to the poor road conditions, she collided with Mr. Mäki's vehicle on the driver's side. The impact caused both vehicles to spin out of control and come to rest on the eastern side of the road.

Upon arrival, emergency services found both drivers conscious but shaken. Mr. Mäki sustained minor injuries to his arm, while Ms. Koivisto complained of neck pain. Witnesses at the scene reported that neither driver appeared to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs.

The incident caused significant traffic disruptions in the area for approximately two hours as emergency services attended to the scene and cleared debris from the road. The vehicles sustained extensive damage, with the Volvo's front-end crumpled and the Mercedes' passenger side door severely dented.

This incident serves as a reminder to all drivers to exercise caution, especially during adverse weather conditions. It is essential to reduce speed, maintain a safe following distance, and be prepared for unexpected situations on the road.

Investigation into the incident is ongoing, with a focus on determining the exact cause of the accident and any contributing factors. Further updates will be provided as information becomes available.
