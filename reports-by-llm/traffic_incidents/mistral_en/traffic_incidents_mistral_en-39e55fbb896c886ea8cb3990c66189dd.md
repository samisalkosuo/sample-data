 Title: Traffic Incident Report
Date: June 29, 2025
Location: Veteli, Finland
Incident Number: 25-13467

On the night of June 29, 2025, at approximately 23:30 hours, a traffic incident occurred on Kauppakatu (Shopping Street) near the intersection with Linnankatu (Castle Street), in the heart of Veteli. The incident involved two vehicles: a silver Toyota Corolla (license plate F-ABC 123) driven by Mr. Jari M채ki, and a black Volkswagen Golf (license plate X-DEF 456) driven by Ms. Liisa Koskela.

According to eyewitness accounts, both vehicles were traveling in opposite directions on Kauppakatu when the incident occurred. The weather conditions at the time were dry but cold, with temperatures hovering around -2째C and visibility unaffected by precipitation or fog. The road surface was wet due to dew, but otherwise, it was clear and well-lit.

The sequence of events began as Mr. M채ki, driving the Toyota Corolla, approached the intersection from Linnankatu with a green light. Simultaneously, Ms. Koskela, in the Volkswagen Golf, was traveling on Kauppakatu, also with a green light. As they entered the intersection, Mr. M채ki failed to yield right-of-way, and the two vehicles collided broadside.

The impact caused significant damage to both vehicles. The Toyota Corolla sustained damage to its front passenger side, while the Volkswagen Golf's driver's side was severely compromised. Both drivers and passengers were wearing seatbelts, and no injuries were reported as serious. However, both drivers were shaken up and required medical attention for minor cuts and bruises.

The incident caused a temporary blockage of traffic in the area, with emergency services arriving on scene within minutes to assess the situation and provide aid. The road was cleared by 01:00 hours, and traffic returned to normal shortly thereafter.

This report is based on eyewitness accounts, physical evidence at the scene, and statements from both drivers involved in the incident. Further investigation will be conducted to determine the exact cause of the collision and any potential contributing factors.
