Location: Nurmijärvi, Finland
Incident Number: NJR-230906-001

On the evening of September 6th, 2023, at approximately 19:45, a traffic incident occurred on Mäkelänkatu, near the intersection with Kaukaskatu, in Nurmijärvi. The incident involved two vehicles: a silver 2018 Volvo XC60 (license plate F-XYZ 123) driven by Mr. Juhani Lehtonen, aged 45, and a black 2021 Toyota Corolla (license plate O-ABC 987) driven by Ms. Sanna Koskinen, aged 32.

According to eyewitness accounts, both vehicles were traveling in the same direction when Mr. Lehtonen's Volvo, due to wet and slippery road conditions, lost traction and began to slide sideways. In an attempt to avoid a collision, Ms. Koskinen applied her brakes but was unable to prevent her Corolla from colliding with the rear passenger side of Mr. Lehtonen's Volvo.

The impact caused both vehicles to spin out of control, with the Volvo coming to rest against a street lamp, and the Corolla coming to rest partially on the sidewalk. No pedestrians were injured in the incident.

Mr. Lehtonen and his passenger, Ms. Liisa Mäkelä, aged 42, were unharmed but shaken. Ms. Koskinen and her passenger, Mr. Eero Saarinen, aged 30, reported minor injuries and were transported to the local hospital for examination and treatment.

The road was closed for approximately two hours while emergency services attended to the scene and cleared debris. The vehicles sustained significant damage, with the Volvo's front passenger side and the Corolla's front end being particularly affected.

Weather conditions at the time of the incident were wet and slippery, with rain falling intermittently throughout the evening. Road surfaces were slick, contributing to the loss of control by Mr. Lehtonen's vehicle.

This report is preliminary and further investigation will be conducted to determine the exact cause of the accident and any potential contributing factors.
