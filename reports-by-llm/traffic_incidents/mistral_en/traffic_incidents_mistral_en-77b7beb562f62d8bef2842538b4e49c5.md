Location: Mänttä-Vilppula, Finland
Incident Number: 241127-003

On the day of November 27, 2024, at approximately 15:30 hours, a multiple vehicle collision occurred on Kauppakatu (Shopping Street) near the intersection with Linnankatu (Castle Street), in Mänttä-Vilppula. The incident involved six vehicles and resulted in minor injuries to several individuals.

The following is a detailed account of the events leading up to the collision:

1. Vehicle 1 (Volvo XC90, license plate FIN-ABC 123), driven by Mr. Juhani Mäkelä (age 45) and carrying two passengers, was traveling southbound on Kauppakatu at a speed estimated to be around 60 km/h.

2. Vehicle 2 (Toyota Corolla, license plate FIN-DEF 456), driven by Ms. Sanna Niemi (age 32) and carrying one passenger, was turning left from Linnankatu onto Kauppakatu, intending to head southbound as well.

3. As Vehicle 2 began its turn, it collided with Vehicle 1, causing both vehicles to spin out of control.

4. In the aftermath of the initial impact, Vehicle 1 came to a stop partially blocking the southbound lane of Kauppakatu, while Vehicle 2 continued moving and struck Vehicle 3 (Ford Focus, license plate FIN-GHI 789), which was stationary at a traffic light waiting to turn left onto Linnankatu.

5. The force of the collision caused Vehicle 3 to spin into the northbound lane of Kauppakatu, where it collided with Vehicle 4 (Mercedes-Benz C-Class, license plate FIN-JKL 901), driven by Mr. Marko Saarinen (age 52) and carrying one passenger.

6. The impact from Vehicle 3 caused Vehicle 4 to swerve into the northbound sidewalk, striking a pedestrian, Ms. Liisa Koskela (age 68).

7. As Vehicle 4 came to a stop on the sidewalk, it was struck by Vehicle 5 (Audi A4, license plate FIN-MNO 123), driven by Mr. Eero Hämäläinen (age 28) and carrying two passengers. Witnesses reported that Mr. Hämäläinen appeared to be attempting to avoid the collision but was unable to do so in time.

8. The final vehicle involved, Vehicle 6 (Skoda Octavia, license plate FIN-PQR 456), driven by Ms. Anna Lehto (age 23) and carrying one passenger, swerved to avoid the chaos on Kauppakatu but ended up colliding with a parked vehicle, causing minor damage.

Upon arrival at the scene, emergency services found that all parties involved were conscious and responsive. Ms. Koskela, the pedestrian struck by Vehicle 4, sustained non-life-threatening injuries and was transported to Mänttä Hospital for treatment. The drivers and passengers of the vehicles involved also received medical attention at the scene before being taken to local hospitals for further evaluation.

The snowy conditions on the day of the incident likely contributed to the collision, as visibility was reduced and road surfaces were slippery. Investigators are currently examining witness statements, vehicle data, and other evidence to determine the exact sequence of events and assign fault, if applicable.

This report is preliminary in nature and subject to change as the investigation continues. Further updates will be provided as information becomes available.
