 Traffic Incident Report

Location: Multia, Finland
Incident Number: MUL-230217-001

On the day of February 17, 2023, at approximately 14:37 hours, a traffic incident occurred on Kauppakatu (Shopping Street) near the intersection with Linnankatu (Castle Street), Multia. The incident involved two vehicles and resulted in minor injuries to one of the drivers.

The first vehicle, a silver Volvo V60 with license plate FIN-ABC 123, was driven by Mr. Juhani Mäki (45 years old) and had a single passenger, Ms. Liisa Niemi (38 years old). The second vehicle, a black Audi Q5 with license plate FIN-DEF 456, was driven by Ms. Sanna Koskela (27 years old), who was alone at the time of the incident.

According to eyewitness accounts, Mr. Mäki was traveling southbound on Kauppakatu while Ms. Koskela was turning left from Linnankatu onto Kauppakatu. The mixed snow and rain conditions had made the road slippery, and as Ms. Koskela began her turn, her vehicle lost traction and slid into the path of Mr. Mäki's oncoming Volvo.

The front ends of both vehicles collided, causing significant damage to the Volvo's bumper and grille, while the Audi sustained damage to its passenger side fender and door. Both drivers were able to exit their vehicles without assistance, but Mr. Mäki complained of pain in his left arm.

Ms. Niemi, who was seated in the front passenger seat of the Volvo, also reported feeling a jolt during the impact. However, neither she nor Ms. Koskela required medical attention at the scene.

Emergency services arrived promptly and assessed Mr. Mäki's injuries. He was transported to Multia Central Hospital for further evaluation and treatment. The traffic flow on Kauppakatu was temporarily disrupted while the incident was being managed, but has since returned to normal.

The incident is currently under investigation by the Multia Police Department. Witness statements are being collected, and both vehicles have been impounded for further examination.

This report will be updated as more information becomes available.
