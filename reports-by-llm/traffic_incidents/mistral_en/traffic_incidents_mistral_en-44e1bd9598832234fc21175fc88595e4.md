 Title: Traffic Incident Report
Date: 24.03.2023
Location: Kumlinge, Finland
Incident Number: TI-230324-KUM-001

On the morning of March 24th, 2023, at approximately 8:37 AM local time, a traffic incident occurred on Vuorimiehenkuja (Warrior's Path), near the intersection with Kyläntie (Village Road) in Kumlinge. The incident involved two vehicles: a silver Toyota Corolla (license plate F-ABC 123) driven by Mr. Juhani Sorsa, aged 45, and a red Volkswagen Golf (license plate O-DEF 456) driven by Ms. Liisa Mäki, aged 38.

According to eyewitness accounts, both vehicles were traveling in the same direction when the incident occurred. Mr. Sorsa was approaching the intersection from Vuorimiehenkuja, while Ms. Mäki was approximately 100 meters ahead on Kyläntie. The weather conditions at the time were unfavorable, with a sudden thunderstorm causing reduced visibility and slippery road surfaces.

As Mr. Sorsa approached the intersection, he reportedly lost control of his vehicle due to the wet and slippery road conditions. His Toyota Corolla skidded sideways across Kyläntie, colliding with Ms. Mäki's Volkswagen Golf on the driver's side. The impact caused both vehicles to spin out of control before coming to a halt.

Emergency services were notified immediately and arrived at the scene within 10 minutes. Both drivers and passengers sustained minor injuries and were transported to the local hospital for treatment. No other vehicles were involved in the incident, and no bystanders were injured.

The road was closed for approximately two hours while the accident was investigated and cleared. The vehicles sustained significant damage, with the Toyota Corolla's front-end crumpled and the Volkswagen Golf's driver's side door severely dented.

This incident serves as a reminder to all drivers to exercise caution during adverse weather conditions and to maintain a safe following distance from other vehicles. The investigation into the cause of the accident is ongoing, with a focus on the road conditions and the role they may have played in the loss of control by Mr. Sorsa.
