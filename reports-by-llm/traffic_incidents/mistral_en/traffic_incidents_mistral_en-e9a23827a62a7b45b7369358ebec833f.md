 Title: Traffic Incident Report - Ilomantsi, Finland - 03.07.2025, 23:45

On the evening of July 3rd, 2025, at approximately 23:45, a three-vehicle collision occurred on Kauppakatu (Shopping Street) in Ilomantsi, Finland. The incident involved a Toyota Corolla (license plate FIN-ABC123), a Volkswagen Golf (FIN-DEF456), and a Volvo XC90 (FIN-GHI789).

The sequence of events began when the Toyota Corolla, driven by Mr. Juhani Mäki (age 35) with passenger Ms. Liisa Koskela (age 28), was traveling southbound on Kauppakatu at an estimated speed of 60 km/h. Simultaneously, the Volvo XC90, driven by Mr. Markku Saari (age 42) with passengers Ms. Sanna Virtanen (age 37) and their two children aged 8 and 10, was traveling northbound on the same street at an estimated speed of 50 km/h.

As both vehicles approached the intersection with Linnankatu (Castle Street), Mr. Mäki failed to notice the Volvo XC90 due to poor visibility caused by the nighttime conditions and insufficient lighting in the area. Consequently, he proceeded through the intersection, colliding with the front-right side of the Volvo XC90. The impact caused the Volvo to spin out of control, striking a parked Mercedes-Benz E-Class (license plate FIN-JKL901) on the east curb of Kauppakatu.

Witnesses at the scene reported that the Volkswagen Golf, driven by Ms. Anna Lehto (age 24), was traveling northbound behind the Volvo XC90 and was unable to stop in time to avoid the collision. The Volkswagen collided with the rear of the spinning Volvo XC90, causing further damage to both vehicles.

Upon arrival, emergency services found all parties involved in the incident unharmed but shaken. Mr. Mäki and Ms. Koskela were issued traffic violation notices for failure to yield at an intersection. The children in the Volvo XC90 were checked by paramedics as a precautionary measure, but no injuries were reported.

The road was closed for approximately two hours while the vehicles were removed and the scene was investigated. The incident underscores the importance of attentive driving, particularly during nighttime conditions and in areas with poor visibility.

Weather conditions at the time of the incident were dry but cold, with temperatures hovering around 10°C (50°F). Road surfaces were slick due to the cool temperature, which may have contributed to the initial collision.

The vehicles involved sustained significant damage as a result of the collision. The Toyota Corolla's front-end was severely damaged, with the bumper and headlights crushed. The Volvo XC90 suffered damage to its front-right side, as well as extensive cosmetic damage from the subsequent collision with the Mercedes-Benz E-Class. The Volkswagen Golf sustained rear-end damage due to the impact with the Volvo XC90.

This report is based on eyewitness accounts and the initial investigation by Ilomantsi Police Department. Further analysis will be conducted as necessary.
