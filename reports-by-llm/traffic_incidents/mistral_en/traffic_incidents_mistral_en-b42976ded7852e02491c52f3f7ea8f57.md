Incident Number: 23-14689

On the evening of May 7th, 2023, at approximately 19:30 local time, a multiple-vehicle collision occurred on Kauppakatu (Shopping Street) near the intersection with Lentokentäntie (Airport Road), in Salla. The incident involved three vehicles and resulted in minor injuries to several individuals.

The following is a detailed account of the events leading up to the accident:

1. Vehicle 1, a silver 2018 Volvo XC60 with license plate F-ABC 123, was traveling southbound on Kauppakatu at a speed estimated between 50 and 60 km/h. The driver, Mr. Juhani Mäki (45), and his passenger, Ms. Liisa Niemi (38), were en route to their residence located at Kauppakatu 21.

2. Vehicle 2, a black 2017 Toyota Corolla with license plate F-DEF 456, was traveling northbound on the same street at an estimated speed of 60 km/h. The driver, Mr. Marko Koskela (32), and his passenger, Ms. Sanna Hämäläinen (28), were returning from a local grocery store located at Lentokentäntie 15.

3. As Vehicle 1 approached the intersection with Lentokentäntie, visibility began to deteriorate due to foggy weather conditions. The driver of Vehicle 1 failed to notice that Vehicle 2 had slowed down and was turning left onto Lentokentäntie.

4. In an attempt to avoid a collision, Mr. Koskela applied his brakes, but the reduced visibility made it difficult for him to stop in time. As a result, Vehicle 2 collided with the rear end of Vehicle 1. The impact caused Vehicle 1 to spin out of control and collide with a parked vehicle, a red 2015 Ford Fiesta with license plate F-GHI 789, located on the east side of Kauppakatu.

5. Witnessing the collision, Mr. Eero Lappalainen (52), who was walking his dog near the scene, immediately called emergency services and provided assistance to the injured parties until medical personnel arrived.

Upon arrival, emergency responders assessed the injuries sustained by those involved in the accident. Ms. Niemi complained of neck pain, while Mr. Koskela reported dizziness. Both were transported to Salla Hospital for further evaluation and treatment. The driver of Vehicle 3 was unharmed and did not require medical attention.

The road was closed for approximately two hours while the scene was investigated and cleared. The vehicles involved in the collision sustained significant damage, with Vehicle 1 suffering the most extensive damage due to the multiple impacts.

This incident serves as a reminder of the importance of maintaining a safe following distance, reducing speed in adverse weather conditions, and remaining vigilant while driving, especially during periods of reduced visibility.

Investigation is ongoing to determine any potential contributing factors and to identify any further actions that may be necessary to prevent similar incidents in the future.
