 Traffic Incident Report

Date: 21.07.2025
Location: Lempäälä, Finland
Incident Number: TI-250721-001
Time of Occurrence: 08:37 (Morning)
Weather Conditions: Snowy

Upon arrival at the scene, I found myself on Kauppakatu, a main road in Lempäälä, near the intersection with Mannerheimintie. The incident involved two vehicles: a silver 2023 Volvo XC90 (license plate F-ABC 123) driven by Mr. Jukka Saarinen, aged 45, and a black 2024 Toyota Corolla Hybrid (license plate O-DEF 456) driven by Ms. Liisa Koskinen, aged 38.

According to eyewitness accounts, the incident occurred when Mr. Saarinen, who was driving southbound on Kauppakatu, failed to stop at a red light at the intersection with Mannerheimintie. The Corolla, which was traveling eastbound on Mannerheimintie, had the right of way and could not avoid colliding with the Volvo as it entered the intersection.

The impact occurred at approximately 08:37, causing both vehicles to spin out of control. The Volvo came to rest against a snowbank on the southwest corner of the intersection, while the Corolla ended up partially blocking the eastbound lanes of Mannerheimintie.

Upon examination, it was determined that Mr. Saarinen had been distracted by his mobile phone at the time of the incident. He was uninjured but visibly shaken. Ms. Koskinen and her passenger, Mr. Eero Hämäläinen, aged 6, sustained minor injuries and were transported to Lempäälä Hospital for treatment.

The snowy conditions on Kauppakatu and Mannerheimintie undoubtedly contributed to the incident by reducing visibility and traction. Road salt trucks had been dispatched earlier in the morning but had not yet reached this area due to heavy traffic congestion caused by the adverse weather conditions.

I issued a citation to Mr. Saarinen for failing to stop at a red light, causing an accident, and using a mobile phone while driving. The vehicles were towed away for further inspection and repairs. This report will be forwarded to the Lempäälä Police Department for further investigation and possible charges against Mr. Saarinen.
