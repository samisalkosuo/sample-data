 Title: Traffic Incident Report
Date: 01.03.2023
Location: Kemijärvi, Finland
Incident Number: 23-KJR-0004

On the evening of March 1st, 2023, a multiple-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Pohjankatu and Rautatiekatu in Kemijärvi. The incident involved three vehicles and resulted in minor injuries to several individuals.

At approximately 19:37, a white Volvo V60 with Finnish license plate FAB-123X, driven by Mr. Jukka Saarinen (45), was traveling southbound on Pohjankatu. Simultaneously, a red Toyota Corolla with license plate YOL-987W, driven by Ms. Liisa Mäki (32), was moving eastbound on Rautatiekatu. Both drivers reported having difficulty navigating the snowy conditions due to reduced visibility and slippery roads.

As Mr. Saarinen approached the intersection, he failed to notice that the traffic light had turned red, and he proceeded into the intersection. At the same time, Ms. Mäki was unable to stop her vehicle in time due to the snowy conditions, resulting in a T-bone collision between the Volvo and Toyota.

The impact caused the Toyota to spin out of control and collide with a parked Mercedes-Benz E-Class (license plate LUK-456Y), owned by Mr. Markku Koskela (58) and parked on the north side of Pohjankatu. The Mercedes sustained minor damage, but no one inside was injured.

Witnesses at the scene reported that the snowfall had been heavy for several hours prior to the incident, making it difficult for drivers to maintain control of their vehicles. Emergency services arrived promptly and provided medical attention to those involved in the collision.

The police are investigating the incident further, focusing on the role of weather conditions and potential contributing factors such as visibility and road maintenance. Both Mr. Saarinen and Ms. Mäki were issued traffic violation notices for failing to stop at a red light and driving without due care and attention in adverse weather conditions, respectively.

This report is preliminary and subject to further investigation. Updates will be provided as more information becomes available.
