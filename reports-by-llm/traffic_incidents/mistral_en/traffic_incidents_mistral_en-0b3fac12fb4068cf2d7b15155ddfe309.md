 Title: Traffic Incident Report
Date: 21st January 2023
Location: Pori, Finland
Incident Number: TI-230121-001

On the day of 21st January 2023, at approximately 14:37 hours, a traffic incident occurred on Mannerheimintie (State Road 8), near the intersection with Keskuskatu (Central Street) in Pori. The incident involved two vehicles: a silver Volkswagen Golf TSI, license plate F-ABC 123, driven by Mr. Jari Saarinen, and a black Toyota Corolla Hybrid, license plate O-DEF 456, driven by Ms. Liisa M채ki.

According to eyewitness accounts, both vehicles were traveling in the same direction on Mannerheimintie when the incident occurred. The overcast weather conditions had reduced visibility slightly, and the road surface was wet due to light rainfall earlier in the day.

Mr. Saarinen, 45 years old, residing at Kauppakatu 21, was approaching the intersection with a speed estimated between 60-70 km/h. Ms. M채ki, 38 years old, living at Linnankatu 37, was traveling slightly behind Mr. Saarinen and was maintaining a safe distance due to the poor visibility.

As Mr. Saarinen approached the intersection, he failed to notice that the traffic lights had turned red, and he proceeded through the intersection, colliding with Ms. M채ki's vehicle on the opposite lane. The impact caused both vehicles to spin out of control before coming to a halt on the opposite side of the road.

Emergency services were notified immediately, and the scene was secured by local law enforcement officers. Both drivers and passengers (Ms. Saarinen, 10 years old, and Mr. M채ki, 9 years old) were uninjured but shaken up from the incident.

Upon inspection of the vehicles, it was determined that both sustained significant damage to their front ends, with the Volkswagen Golf requiring a tow truck for removal. The Toyota Corolla Hybrid was able to be driven away after minor repairs were made on-site.

The investigation is ongoing, and charges may be filed against Mr. Saarinen for disregarding a red traffic light. Witness statements are being collected, and the incident report will be forwarded to the prosecutor's office for review.
