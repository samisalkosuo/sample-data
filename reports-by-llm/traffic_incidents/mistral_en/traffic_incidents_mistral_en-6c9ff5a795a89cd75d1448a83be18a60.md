 Title: Traffic Incident Report - 03.07.2023, Kouvola, Finland

On the evening of July 3rd, 2023, at approximately 19:45 local time, an unfortunate traffic incident occurred on Mäkelänkatu, a major road in Kouvola, Finland. The incident involved three vehicles: a Volkswagen Golf (license plate F-ABC 123), a Toyota Corolla (F-DEF 456), and a Mercedes-Benz C-Class (F-GHI 789).

Witness accounts suggest that the Volkswagen Golf, driven by Mr. Jari Mäkelä (age 35, resident of Mäkelänkatu 21), was traveling southbound on Mäkelänkatu at a moderate speed. Simultaneously, the Toyota Corolla, driven by Ms. Liisa Kouvolanranta (age 42, resident of Kouvolantie 37), was approaching from the opposite direction. Both drivers reported having difficulty maintaining control due to the icy road conditions.

As Mr. Mäkelä attempted to navigate a curve in the road, his vehicle lost traction and began to slide sideways into the northbound lane. At the same time, Ms. Kouvolanranta, who was unable to avoid the sliding Volkswagen, collided with it head-on. The impact caused both vehicles to spin out of control, and they came to a stop on the road, blocking traffic in both directions.

A third vehicle, the Mercedes-Benz C-Class driven by Mr. Eero Hämeenlinna (age 50, resident of Hämeenlinnanranta 45), was unable to avoid the collision and rear-ended the Toyota Corolla. All three drivers and passengers were wearing seatbelts and sustained only minor injuries.

Emergency services arrived at the scene within minutes, with police officers, firefighters, and paramedics all responding promptly. The road was closed for approximately two hours while the vehicles were removed and the scene was cleared.

The incident serves as a reminder to drivers to exercise caution, especially during adverse weather conditions. Road safety is of utmost importance, and we encourage all motorists to drive responsibly and adapt their driving style to the prevailing road and weather conditions.

Investigation into the incident is ongoing, with a focus on determining the exact cause of the initial loss of control by Mr. Mäkelä's vehicle. No charges have been filed at this time.
