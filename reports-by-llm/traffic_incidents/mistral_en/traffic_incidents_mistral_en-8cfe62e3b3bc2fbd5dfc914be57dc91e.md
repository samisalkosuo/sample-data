 Title: Traffic Incident Report
Date: July 19, 2023
Location: Kauniainen, Finland
Incident Number: KA-230719-001

On the evening of July 19, 2023, at approximately 19:45 local time, a multi-vehicle collision occurred on Tietotie (Technology Road) near the intersection with Linnankatu (Castle Street), in Kauniainen. The incident involved three vehicles and resulted in minor injuries to several individuals.

The first vehicle involved was a silver 2018 Volvo XC60 (license plate F-XYZ 123) driven by Mr. Juhani Särkijärvi, aged 45, of Mannerheimintie 76, Kauniainen. The second vehicle was a black 2020 Toyota Corolla (license plate O-ABC 987) driven by Ms. Liisa Koskinen, aged 32, of Kaukokatu 45, Espoo. The third vehicle was a red 2015 Ford Focus (license plate P-DEF 456) driven by Mr. Markku Laaksonen, aged 58, of Kauniainencentrum 22, Kauniainen.

According to eyewitness accounts, the incident began when Mr. Särkijärvi's Volvo was traveling southbound on Tietotie at a speed estimated between 60-70 km/h. As he approached the intersection with Linnankatu, the road surface became slippery due to mixed snow and rain conditions. The Volvo lost traction, causing it to slide sideways into the path of Ms. Koskinen's oncoming Corolla.

Ms. Koskinen attempted to swerve to avoid the collision but was unable to do so in time. Her Corolla collided with the driver's side of Mr. Särkijärvi's Volvo, causing both vehicles to spin out of control. The Ford Focus, driven by Mr. Laaksonen, was traveling behind Ms. Koskinen and was unable to stop in time, striking the rear of the spinning Corolla.

Emergency services arrived at the scene within 10 minutes of the initial call. All parties involved were assessed for injuries, with Ms. Koskinen and Mr. Laaksonen sustaining minor cuts and bruises. They were transported to Kauniainen Hospital for further evaluation and treatment. Mr. Särkijärvi declined medical attention at the scene but was advised to seek a check-up due to the force of the impact.

The vehicles involved in the incident sustained significant damage. The Volvo's driver's side door was crushed, the Corolla's front and rear ends were damaged, and the Ford Focus suffered minor damage to its front bumper.

The road was closed for approximately two hours while the scene was cleared and investigated by local police. Traffic was diverted through alternate routes during this time. The incident remains under investigation, with a focus on the role of mixed snow and rain conditions in contributing to the collision.

This report is submitted for the record and will be forwarded to the appropriate authorities as required.
