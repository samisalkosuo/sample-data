 Title: Traffic Incident Report
Date: November 16, 2022
Location: Humppila, Finland
Incident Number: HUMP-221116-003

On the morning of November 16, 2022, at approximately 8:45 AM, a traffic incident occurred on Kauppakatu (Shopping Street) near the intersection with Miettisalmentie (Mietti Farm Road), in Humppila. The incident involved two vehicles: a silver Toyota Corolla (license plate F-ABC 123) driven by Mr. Jukka Saarinen, aged 45, and a black Volkswagen Golf (license plate XYZ 987) driven by Ms. Liisa Mäki, aged 38.

According to eyewitness accounts, both vehicles were traveling in opposite directions on Kauppakatu when the incident occurred. Mr. Saarinen was approaching the intersection from Miettisalmentie, while Ms. Mäki was coming from Kauppakatu. The weather conditions at the time were unfavorable, with a thunderstorm causing poor visibility and slippery road surfaces.

As Mr. Saarinen approached the intersection, he reportedly failed to notice that the traffic light had turned red due to the heavy rain and reduced visibility. Ms. Mäki, who had the right of way, continued through the intersection, but unfortunately, Mr. Saarinen proceeded as well, resulting in a collision between the two vehicles.

The impact caused significant damage to both vehicles. The Toyota Corolla sustained front-end damage, with the bumper and hood crumpled, while the Volkswagen Golf suffered rear-end damage, including a shattered rear window and a damaged trunk lid. Both drivers and passengers—Mr. Saarinen's wife, Mrs. Sari Saarinen, aged 42, and Ms. Mäki's son, Mr. Eero Mäki, aged 10—were uninjured but shaken by the incident.

Emergency services arrived at the scene promptly and assessed the situation. The vehicles were towed away for further inspection and potential repairs. The road was temporarily closed to ensure the safety of other motorists, causing minor traffic congestion in the area.

The incident is currently under investigation by local authorities. Charges may be filed against Mr. Saarinen if it is determined that he failed to obey a traffic signal, contributing to the collision. Both drivers and witnesses have been interviewed, and relevant evidence has been collected from the scene.

This report will be updated as more information becomes available.
