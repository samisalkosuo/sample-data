 Title: Traffic Incident Report
Date: October 20, 2023
Location: Keuruu, Finland
Incident Number: KEU-231020-001

On the morning of October 20, 2023, at approximately 8:45 AM local time, a traffic incident occurred on Hämeenkatu, a major road in Keuruu. The incident involved two vehicles: a silver Volvo XC60 with license plate F-XYZ123 (Driver: Mr. Jari Mäki, Passenger: Ms. Liisa Mäki) and a black Audi Q5 with license plate O-ABC456 (Driver: Mr. Markku Saarinen).

According to eyewitness accounts, the incident began when Mr. Mäki, driving the Volvo XC60, approached an intersection at Hämeenkatu and Kauppakatu. The traffic light was green for Mr. Mäki, but as he proceeded through the intersection, a sudden downpour of mixed snow and rain reduced visibility significantly.

At the same time, Mr. Saarinen, driving the Audi Q5 from the opposite direction on Kauppakatu, failed to notice the red traffic light due to the poor weather conditions. As a result, he collided with the Volvo XC60 in the intersection.

The impact caused both vehicles to spin out of control and come to a halt on the road. The Volvo sustained significant front-end damage, while the Audi had damage to its passenger side. Both drivers and passengers reported no serious injuries but were shaken up by the incident.

Emergency services arrived at the scene promptly and assessed the situation. The road was closed for approximately one hour to allow for the removal of the damaged vehicles and cleanup of debris. During this time, traffic was diverted through alternate routes.

The weather conditions undoubtedly played a significant role in this incident, reducing visibility and making it difficult for drivers to navigate safely. As such, we remind all motorists to exercise caution when driving in adverse weather conditions and always prioritize safety over speed.

This report is based on eyewitness accounts, the statements of the involved parties, and an on-site investigation by the Keuruu Police Department. The incident remains under further investigation.
