 Title: Traffic Incident Report - 31.05.2025, Kärsämäki, Finland

On the night of May 31st, 2025, at approximately 23:47 local time, a traffic incident occurred on Vuokkijantie (State Road 26), near the intersection with Metsänkartanonkatu, in Kärsämäki, Finland. The incident involved two vehicles: a silver 2023 Volvo XC90 (license plate F-XYZ123) driven by Mr. Juhani Lehto, aged 45, and a black 2024 Toyota Corolla Hybrid (license plate O-ABC456) driven by Ms. Sanna Mäki, aged 32.

According to eyewitness accounts, Mr. Lehto was traveling southbound on Vuokkijantie at a speed estimated between 70 and 80 km/h. The road conditions were wet and slippery due to overnight rainfall, reducing visibility and traction for the vehicles. Ms. Mäki was approaching the same intersection from the east on Metsänkartanonkatu, also traveling at an estimated speed of 60 km/h.

As Mr. Lehto approached the intersection, he failed to notice the stop sign due to poor visibility and the reflectors being obscured by puddles. He continued through the intersection, colliding with Ms. Mäki's vehicle as she entered Vuokkijantie from Metsänkartanonkatu. The impact caused both vehicles to spin out of control, with the Volvo coming to a rest against a roadside tree, and the Toyota coming to a stop partially on the sidewalk.

Upon arrival at the scene, emergency services found no injuries among the drivers or passengers involved. Mr. Lehto and his passenger, Ms. Liisa Kivinen (aged 43), were in the Volvo, while Ms. Mäki was alone in the Toyota. All parties involved were shaken but unharmed.

The incident caused significant damage to both vehicles. The front end of the Volvo sustained heavy damage, with the bumper and grille being crushed against the tree. The Toyota's passenger side received moderate damage, with a dented door and broken side mirror.

The road was closed for approximately two hours while the scene was cleared and investigated by local authorities. Charges are pending against Mr. Lehto for failing to stop at a stop sign, resulting in the traffic incident. Both vehicles were towed from the scene, and their drivers were offered transportation home.

This report is based on eyewitness accounts, physical evidence at the scene, and interviews with the involved parties. The investigation remains ongoing to determine the exact cause of the accident and any contributing factors.
