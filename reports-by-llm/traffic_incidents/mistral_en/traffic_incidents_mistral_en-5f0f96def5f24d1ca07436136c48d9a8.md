 Title: Traffic Incident Report

Date: February 28, 2023
Location: Pedersören kunta, Finland
Incident Number: PED-230228-001

On the evening of February 28, 2023, at approximately 19:45 local time, a traffic incident occurred on Kauppakatu (Shopping Street) near the intersection with Mannerheimintie (Mannerheim Avenue), in Pedersören municipality. The incident involved two vehicles: a silver Toyota Corolla (license plate FIN-ABC 123) driven by Mr. Juhani Särkijärvi, aged 45, and a black Volkswagen Golf (license plate FIN-DEF 456) driven by Ms. Liisa Mäkelä, aged 38.

According to eyewitness accounts, both vehicles were traveling in the same direction on Kauppakatu when the incident occurred. Mr. Särkijärvi was reportedly driving at a speed slightly above the posted limit due to his late arrival at work. Ms. Mäkelä, on the other hand, was described as driving cautiously due to the foggy weather conditions that had set in during the evening.

As Mr. Särkijärvi approached the intersection with Mannerheimintie, he failed to notice the red traffic light and collided with Ms. Mäkelä's vehicle, which was stopped at the red light. The impact caused both vehicles to spin out of control, blocking the intersection and causing a temporary traffic jam.

Upon arrival, emergency services found Mr. Särkijärvi and Ms. Mäkelä unharmed but shaken. Both drivers were administered first aid before being transported to Pedersören Hospital for further examination. The Toyota Corolla sustained significant front-end damage, while the Volkswagen Golf had minor rear-end damage.

The foggy weather conditions and poor visibility at the time of the incident are believed to have contributed to Mr. Särkijärvi's inability to stop in time. The investigation is ongoing, with a focus on determining the exact cause of the collision and any potential contributing factors.

This report will be updated as more information becomes available.
