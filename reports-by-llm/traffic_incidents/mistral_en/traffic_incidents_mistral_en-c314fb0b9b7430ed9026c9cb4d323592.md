 Title: Traffic Incident Report
Date: July 19, 2024
Location: Veteli, Finland
Incident Number: 24-3567

On the evening of July 19, 2024, at approximately 19:30 hours, a traffic incident occurred on Kauppakatu (Shopping Street) near the intersection with Linnankatu (Castle Street), in the heart of Veteli. The incident involved two vehicles: a silver Toyota Corolla (license plate F-ABC 123) driven by Mr. Jari Mäki, aged 45, and a black Volkswagen Golf (license plate X-DEF 456) driven by Ms. Liisa Koskela, aged 38.

According to eyewitness accounts, both vehicles were traveling in opposite directions on Kauppakatu when the incident occurred. Mr. Mäki was approaching the intersection from Linnankatu, while Ms. Koskela was coming from Kauppakatu. The weather conditions at the time were windy with gusts, which may have contributed to the accident.

The sequence of events, as gathered from eyewitness testimonies and physical evidence at the scene, is as follows:

1. Mr. Mäki, while approaching the intersection, failed to notice that Ms. Koskela's Volkswagen was turning left onto Linnankatu due to the poor visibility caused by the windy conditions.
2. In an attempt to avoid a collision, Ms. Koskela applied her brakes, but due to the strong winds, she lost control of her vehicle, which began to drift towards Mr. Mäki's lane.
3. Unable to react in time, Mr. Mäki collided with the Volkswagen on the driver's side. The impact caused both vehicles to spin out of control and come to a halt on the opposite sides of the intersection.
4. Immediately after the collision, concerned bystanders called emergency services, and traffic was diverted away from the scene.

Upon arrival, the Veteli Police Department's accident response team found no signs of intoxication or excessive speed in either driver. Both Mr. Mäki and Ms. Koskela were transported to the local hospital for precautionary checks. The Toyota Corolla sustained significant damage to its front-left fender, while the Volkswagen Golf had damage to both the front and rear passenger sides.

The incident caused minor traffic disruptions in the area, but the scene was cleared by 21:00 hours. The investigation is ongoing, with a focus on determining whether weather conditions played a role in the accident.

This report will be updated as more information becomes available.
