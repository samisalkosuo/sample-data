Incident Number: 23456-2024

On the night of May 12th, 2024, at approximately 23:37 hours, a traffic incident occurred on Mäkelänkatu (Mäkelä Street), near the intersection with Kauppakatu (Shopping Street). The incident involved two vehicles: a silver Toyota Corolla (license plate F-ABC 123) driven by Mr. Juhani Särkijärvi, aged 45, and a black Volkswagen Golf (license plate O-DEF 456) driven by Ms. Liisa Mäkeläinen, aged 38.

According to eyewitness accounts, both vehicles were traveling in the same direction on Mäkelänkatu when they collided at the intersection due to poor visibility caused by foggy weather conditions. The Toyota Corolla was approaching the intersection from Kauppakatu, while the Volkswagen Golf was already on Mäkelänkatu.

The first witness, Mr. Eero Hämäläinen (aged 52), who resides at Kauppakatu 10, reported seeing the Toyota Corolla's headlights approaching the intersection but not slowing down as expected. The second witness, Ms. Sanna Miettinen (aged 34), a resident of Mäkelänkatu 25, confirmed that the fog was dense and reduced visibility significantly.

Upon impact, both vehicles sustained substantial damage. The front-end of the Toyota Corolla was severely crumpled, while the Volkswagen Golf's passenger side suffered extensive damage. Both drivers were able to exit their vehicles without assistance, but Ms. Mäkeläinen complained of neck pain and was transported to Hämeenkyrö Hospital for further evaluation.

The road was closed for approximately two hours to allow for the removal of the damaged vehicles and cleanup of debris. Traffic control measures were implemented during this time to ensure the safety of other motorists. The incident is currently under investigation, with a focus on determining the exact cause of the collision and assessing any potential contributing factors such as speed or impairment.
