 **Traffic Incident Report**

Date: July 13, 2024
Location: Lemland, Finland
Incident Number: LM-24-0713-001

On the morning of July 13, 2024, at approximately 8:35 AM, a traffic incident occurred on Vuorimiehenkuja (Warrior's Path), a major road connecting the heart of Lemland with its outskirts. The incident involved two vehicles: a silver Toyota Corolla (license plate F-ABC 123) driven by Mr. Juhani Kivinen, aged 45, and a black Volkswagen Golf (license plate X-DEF 456) driven by Ms. Sanna Mäki, aged 38.

According to eyewitness accounts, both vehicles were traveling in the same direction when the incident occurred near the intersection with Kylämiehenkuja (Farmer's Path). The weather conditions at the time were mixed snow and rain, which had made the roads slippery and reduced visibility.

Mr. Kivinen, who was driving the Toyota Corolla, reported that he lost control of his vehicle due to the adverse weather conditions. His car slid onto the opposite lane, colliding with Ms. Mäki's Volkswagen Golf. The impact caused both vehicles to spin out of control and come to a halt on the side of the road.

Upon arrival at the scene, emergency services found Mr. Kivinen and his passenger, Mrs. Liisa Kivinen (aged 42), uninjured but shaken. Ms. Mäki and her passenger, Mr. Petri Särkijärvi (aged 35), were also unharmed but similarly affected by the incident.

The Toyota Corolla sustained significant front-end damage, with the bumper and grille severely damaged. The Volkswagen Golf suffered similar damage to its front end, with the hood crumpled and windshield cracked. Both vehicles were towed away from the scene for further inspection and repair.

The incident caused minor traffic disruptions as emergency services attended to the scene and cleared the road. The road was reopened by 9:45 AM, and no further incidents were reported in the area during that morning.

This report is based on eyewitness accounts, statements from the drivers involved, and an on-site investigation conducted by the Lemland Traffic Police. The incident remains under investigation to determine any contributing factors or potential violations of traffic laws.
