On the night of January 21st, 2024, at approximately 23:37 hours, a multi-vehicle collision occurred on Kyläntie (Village Road), near the intersection with Metsänkartano Street in Kyyjärvi, Finland. The incident involved seven vehicles and resulted in minor injuries to several individuals.

The following is a detailed account of the events leading up to the accident:

1. Initial Incident (23:37)
   Witness statements suggest that a northbound Toyota RAV4 (license plate F-ABC 123) driven by Mr. Jukka Mäki (age 35, resident of Kyläntie 2A) was traveling at an estimated speed of 60 km/h when it collided with a southbound Volvo XC90 (license plate F-DEF 456), driven by Ms. Liisa Koskela (age 42, resident of Metsänkartano 1B). The impact caused the Volvo to spin out of control and strike a stationary Mercedes-Benz E-Class (license plate F-GHI 789) parked on the side of the road.

2. Chain Reaction (23:38)
   As a result of the initial collision, a chain reaction ensued. A northbound Ford Focus (license plate F-JKL 012), driven by Mr. Marko Saari (age 28, resident of Kyläntie 4C), swerved to avoid the Volvo and collided with a southbound Mazda CX-5 (license plate F-MNO 345) driven by Ms. Anna Lehtonen (age 30, resident of Metsänkartano 3D). The Ford then struck a stationary Peugeot 208 (license plate F-PQR 678), parked on the side of the road.

3. Secondary Collision (23:40)
   In the aftermath of the initial collision, a southbound Volkswagen Golf (license plate F-STU 910), driven by Mr. Eero Lappalainen (age 52, resident of Metsänkartano 2A), attempted to slow down and swerve around the accident scene but collided with a northbound Honda CR-V (license plate F-VWX 123) driven by Ms. Sanna Nurmi (age 24, resident of Kyläntie 6B).

Weather conditions at the time of the incident were overcast, with visibility slightly reduced due to light snowfall and poor street lighting in the area. Road conditions were slippery due to a thin layer of ice on the asphalt.

Emergency services arrived at the scene promptly and assessed the injuries sustained by those involved. Minor injuries were reported, with no life-threatening conditions. The vehicles involved were towed away for further inspection and assessment of damages.

The incident is currently under investigation by local authorities, with a focus on determining the contributing factors, including speed, weather conditions, and road maintenance. Recommendations for improved street lighting and potential traffic calming measures are being considered in response to this incident.
