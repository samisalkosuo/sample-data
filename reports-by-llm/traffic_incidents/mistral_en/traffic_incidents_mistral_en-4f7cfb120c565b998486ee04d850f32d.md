 Title: Traffic Incident Report
Date: August 21, 2024
Location: Hämeenlinna, Finland
Incident Number: 24-35678

On the night of August 21, 2024, at approximately 23:30 local time, a multi-vehicle collision occurred on Mannerheimintie (State Highway 3), near the intersection with Kauppakatu (Street of Trade) in Hämeenlinna. The incident involved three vehicles and resulted in minor injuries to several individuals.

The first vehicle involved was a silver 2024 Volvo XC90, license plate F-XYZ123, driven by Mr. Jari Saarinen (56) with his wife, Mrs. Liisa Saarinen (54), as a passenger. The second vehicle was a black 2022 Toyota Corolla, license plate O-ABC987, driven by Ms. Sanna Koskinen (32). The third vehicle was a red 2021 Ford Focus, license plate L-DEF456, driven by Mr. Markku Mäki (45), with his daughter, Miss Emilia Mäki (12), as a passenger.

According to eyewitness accounts, the foggy conditions made visibility poor, and Mr. Saarinen's Volvo, traveling at approximately 60 km/h, failed to notice that Ms. Koskinen's Corolla had slowed down due to the adverse weather conditions. As a result, the Volvo collided with the rear of the Corolla, causing it to spin out of control and strike the Ford Focus, which was stationary at a red light on Kauppakatu.

Upon arrival, emergency services found all parties involved in the incident unharmed but shaken. Mr. Saarinen and Ms. Koskinen were treated for minor injuries at the scene, while Mr. Mäki and his daughter were not injured. The Volvo sustained significant front-end damage, the Corolla had extensive rear damage, and the Ford Focus suffered moderate front-end damage.

The incident caused a temporary closure of Mannerheimintie in both directions, with traffic being diverted via Kauppakatu and Torikatu (Market Street). The road was reopened by 01:30 local time after the vehicles were towed away, and the scene had been cleared.

The investigation is ongoing to determine the exact cause of the collision and any potential contributing factors, such as speeding or impaired driving. This report will be updated as more information becomes available.
