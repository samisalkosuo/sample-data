Location: Intersection of Kauppakatu and Linnankatu, Hammarland, Finland
Weather Conditions: Overcast with occasional light rain showers

Incident Summary:
A four-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Linnankatu during the evening rush hour. The incident involved a Toyota Corolla (license plate F-XYZ 123), a Volkswagen Golf (F-ABC 456), a Ford Focus (F-DEF 789), and a Mercedes-Benz C-Class (F-GHI 012).

Witness Accounts:
A local resident, Mr. Jari Mäki (address: Kauppakatu 3, Hammarland), reported seeing the Toyota Corolla driven by Ms. Anna Särkijärvi (age 28) approaching the intersection from Kauppakatu at a high speed. As she entered the intersection, she failed to yield to oncoming traffic and collided with the Volkswagen Golf, driven by Mr. Marko Koskinen (age 35).

Mr. Koskinen was unable to stop in time and swerved to avoid the collision, but his vehicle struck the Ford Focus, driven by Ms. Liisa Lappalainen (age 42), who had the right of way. The Mercedes-Benz C-Class, driven by Mr. Juhani Virtanen (age 50), was unable to avoid the chain reaction and collided with the Ford Focus.

Investigation:
Upon arrival at the scene, emergency services found all vehicles involved in various states of damage. The Toyota Corolla sustained significant front-end damage, while the Volkswagen Golf had damage to both the front and rear ends. The Ford Focus was severely damaged on the driver's side, and the Mercedes-Benz C-Class had minor damage to its front bumper.

Preliminary investigations suggest that Ms. Särkijärvi may have been driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs, as her speech was slurred, and she exhibited signs of impairment. A breathalyzer test was administered at the scene, with results pending.

Road Conditions:
At the time of the incident, the road surfaces were wet due to light rain showers. Visibility was reduced by the overcast conditions, but all vehicles involved had functioning headlights and taillights. The intersection where the collision occurred is well-lit, with traffic signals operating correctly at the time of the incident.

Conclusion:
The investigation into this incident is ongoing, with a focus on determining the cause and contributing factors. Preliminary findings suggest that impaired driving may have played a role in the accident. Further testing will be conducted to confirm these suspicions.

All parties involved were transported to local hospitals for treatment of non-life-threatening injuries. The intersection was closed for several hours while emergency services attended to the scene and cleared debris. Traffic flow has since been restored, with increased police presence in the area to ensure safety.
