Incident Description:

On August 31, 2023, at approximately 23:17, a traffic incident occurred at the intersection of Kylpyläntie and Hämeenkylänkatu in Tuusula. The incident involved three vehicles: a black Volvo XC90 (FIN-ABC 123), a silver Toyota Corolla (FIN-DEF 456), and a red Ford Focus (FIN-GHI 789).

According to witness statements, the incident began when Mr. Jukka Saarinen (Volvo XC90) was approaching the intersection from Kylpyläntie with a green light. At the same time, Ms. Liisa Mäki (Toyota Corolla) was traveling south on Hämeenkylänkatu, also with a green light. Mr. Eero Koskinen (Ford Focus) was turning left from Hämeenkylänkatu onto Kylpyläntie, but failed to yield the right of way to Mr. Saarinen's Volvo XC90.

As a result, Mr. Saarinen's vehicle collided with the side of Mr. Koskinen's Ford Focus, causing both vehicles to spin out of control and come to rest in the intersection. Ms. Mäki's Toyota Corolla, unable to stop in time due to the sudden collision, rear-ended Mr. Saarinen's Volvo XC90.

The mixed snow and rain conditions made the road surfaces slippery, contributing to the chaotic nature of the incident. Emergency services arrived at the scene promptly and assessed all parties involved for injuries.

Mr. Koskinen was found to have sustained minor injuries and was transported to Tuusula Hospital for further evaluation. Mr. Saarinen and Ms. Mäki reported no injuries but were shaken by the incident.

The Volvo XC90 sustained significant damage to its passenger side, while the Ford Focus had extensive damage to both the front and rear ends. The Toyota Corolla suffered moderate damage to its front bumper.

This report is based on witness statements, physical evidence at the scene, and the initial assessment of the involved parties' conditions. A full investigation will be conducted by the Tuusula Police Department to determine the exact cause of the incident and any potential charges.
