 Title: Traffic Incident Report
Date: August 8, 2023
Location: Loimaa, Finland
Incident Number: L-230808-1234

On the evening of August 8, 2023, at approximately 7:45 PM local time, a traffic incident occurred on Mäkelänkatu (Mäkelä Street), near the intersection with Kauppakatu (Shopping Street). The incident involved two vehicles: a silver Toyota Corolla (license plate F-ABC 123) driven by Mr. Jari Mäkelä, aged 45, and a black Volkswagen Golf (license plate X-DEF 456) driven by Ms. Liisa Kauppi, aged 38.

According to eyewitness accounts, both vehicles were traveling in opposite directions when the incident occurred. Mr. Mäkelä was approaching the intersection from Mäkelänkatu, while Ms. Kauppi was coming from Kauppakatu. The weather conditions at the time were unfavorable, with a severe thunderstorm causing heavy rain and reduced visibility.

As Mr. Mäkelä approached the intersection, he reportedly failed to notice that the traffic light had turned red due to the poor visibility caused by the storm. Ms. Kauppi, who had a green light, continued driving straight onto Mäkelänkatu. Unable to stop in time, Mr. Mäkelä's Toyota Corolla collided with Ms. Kauppi's Volkswagen Golf.

The impact caused significant damage to both vehicles. The front end of the Toyota Corolla was severely crumpled, while the Volkswagen Golf sustained damage to its passenger side. Both drivers and their respective passengers—Ms. Sari Mäkelä (age 42) in the Toyota and Mr. Eero Kauppi (age 10) in the Volkswagen—were uninjured but shaken by the incident.

Emergency services arrived at the scene promptly, with a police patrol car, an ambulance, and a tow truck dispatched from the Loimaa Police Department and the local hospital. The road was closed for approximately two hours while the vehicles were removed and the scene was investigated.

The incident is currently under investigation by the Loimaa Traffic Unit. Preliminary findings suggest that Mr. Mäkelä's failure to obey a traffic signal may have contributed to the accident. However, the poor weather conditions are also being considered as a factor in the incident.

This report will be updated as more information becomes available.
