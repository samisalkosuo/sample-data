Incident Description:
The incident occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Yliopistonkatu, near the city center of Pietarsaari. According to witness statements, Driver 1 was traveling southbound on Kauppakatu while Driver 2 was heading east on Yliopistonkatu. The overcast weather conditions and reduced visibility made it difficult for both drivers to see each other in time.

At approximately 23:37, Driver 1 failed to stop at the red light at the intersection and collided with Driver 2's vehicle as it was proceeding through the green light. The impact caused both vehicles to spin out of control before coming to a halt on the northeast corner of the intersection.

Immediate Response:
Emergency services were notified by witnesses, and police officers from the Pietarsaari Police Department arrived at the scene within minutes. Fire and rescue services also responded to extricate the passengers from the damaged vehicles.

All three occupants of Vehicle 1 sustained minor injuries and were transported to the Oulu University Hospital for further evaluation. Driver 2 did not report any injuries but was visibly shaken by the incident.

Damage Assessment:
Both vehicles sustained significant damage in the collision, with the Volvo XC90 suffering front-end damage and the Toyota Corolla having damage to its passenger side. The intersection was closed for several hours while the scene was investigated and cleared.

Investigation Findings:
Preliminary investigation suggests that Driver 1 may have been distracted or impaired at the time of the incident, as there were no skid marks indicating an attempt to stop before the collision. A toxicology report is pending, and further investigation will be conducted to determine the exact cause of the accident.

Conclusion:
This traffic incident occurred due to a failure to obey traffic signals and potentially driver impairment or distraction. The police department urges all drivers to exercise caution, especially during adverse weather conditions, and to always prioritize safety on the roads.
