Location: Korsnäs, Finland
Incident Number: TI-2025-KOR-001
Time of Occurrence: 08:37 (Morning)
Weather Conditions: Heavy Rain

Upon arrival at the scene, I found two vehicles involved in a collision on Mäkelänkatu, near the intersection with Kauppakatu. The incident occurred approximately 50 meters north of the Korsnäs Town Hall (Korsnäs Ratin talo).

Vehicle 1: A silver Volvo XC90 (license plate FIN-ABC 123) was traveling southbound on Mäkelänkatu. The driver, Mr. Jukka Saarinen (DOB: 01/01/1985), and his passenger, Ms. Liisa Koskela (DOB: 06/06/1990), were both uninjured but shaken up.

Vehicle 2: A black Mercedes-Benz C-Class (license plate FIN-DEF 456) was turning left from Kauppakatu onto Mäkelänkatu when it collided with the Volvo XC90. The driver, Mr. Marko Hämäläinen (DOB: 12/12/1982), and his passenger, Ms. Sanna Niemi (DOB: 03/03/1995), were both transported to Korsnäs Hospital for precautionary checks due to minor injuries sustained in the accident.

Witness statements suggest that Mr. Hämäläinen began his left turn as the heavy rain made visibility difficult, and he failed to notice the approaching Volvo XC90. The impact caused significant damage to both vehicles, with the front-end of the Mercedes-Benz C-Class crumpled, and the Volvo XC90 sustaining damage to its passenger side.

The road conditions at the time of the incident were slippery due to the heavy rain, which likely contributed to the collision. The vehicles involved will be towed to the Korsnäs Police Department for further investigation and evidence collection.

This report is preliminary and subject to change as more information becomes available. Further updates will be provided as necessary.
