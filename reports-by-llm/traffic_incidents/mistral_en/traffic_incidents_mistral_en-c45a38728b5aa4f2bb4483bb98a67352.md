On the night of April 28th, 2023, at approximately 23:37 hours, a traffic incident occurred on Kauppakatu (Shopping Street) near the intersection with Linnankatu (Castle Street), in the heart of Heinävesi. The incident involved two vehicles: a silver Toyota Corolla (license plate F-XYZ 123) driven by Mr. Jukka Saarinen, aged 45, and a black Volkswagen Golf (license plate O-ABC 987) driven by Ms. Liisa Mäki, aged 38.

According to eyewitness accounts, both vehicles were traveling in opposite directions on Kauppakatu when the incident occurred. The icy road conditions played a significant role in the accident, as both drivers reported losing control of their vehicles due to the slippery surface.

The sequence of events began when Mr. Saarinen, while driving the Toyota Corolla southbound on Kauppakatu, approached the intersection with Linnankatu. At the same time, Ms. Mäki was traveling northbound in her Volkswagen Golf. As they both entered the icy intersection, their vehicles began to slide and collide, resulting in significant damage to both vehicles.

Upon arrival at the scene, emergency services found Mr. Saarinen and Ms. Mäki uninjured but shaken. Both drivers were cooperative and provided statements detailing the events leading up to the collision. Witnesses corroborated their accounts, stating that they had seen both vehicles losing control on the icy road before the impact.

The Toyota Corolla sustained damage to its front bumper, grille, and left headlight, while the Volkswagen Golf suffered damage to its right fender, hood, and windshield. Both vehicles were towed from the scene for further inspection and repairs.

This incident serves as a reminder of the importance of driving cautiously, especially during adverse weather conditions. The police urge all drivers to adjust their speed according to road and weather conditions to ensure safety on Finnish roads.

Investigation into this incident is ongoing, with a focus on determining whether any traffic laws were violated by either driver. Further updates will be provided as the investigation progresses.
