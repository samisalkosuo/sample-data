 Title: Traffic Incident Report - 08.10.2023, Vantaa, Finland

On October 8th, 2023, at approximately 14:37 hours, an eight-vehicle collision occurred on Tikkurila Road (State Road 6) near the intersection with Myyrmäki Road (County Road 159), in Vantaa, Finland. The incident took place during daytime under overcast weather conditions, which limited visibility and contributed to the accident.

The following is a detailed account of the events leading up to the collision:

Vehicle 1 (2023 Toyota Corolla, license plate F-ABC 123), driven by Mr. Juhani Mäki (45 years old) with passenger Ms. Sanna Niemi (38 years old), was traveling southbound on Tikkurila Road at a speed estimated to be around 60 km/h.

Simultaneously, Vehicle 2 (2019 Volkswagen Golf, license plate F-DEF 456), driven by Ms. Liisa Koskela (32 years old) with passenger Mr. Eero Saarinen (28 years old), was approaching the same intersection from Myyrmäki Road, also traveling southbound but at a slower speed of approximately 40 km/h.

As Vehicle 1 approached the intersection, it failed to stop at the red traffic light and collided with Vehicle 2, causing both vehicles to spin out of control. The impact forced Vehicle 2 into the path of an oncoming vehicle, Vehicle 3 (2018 Mercedes-Benz C-Class, license plate F-GHI 789), driven by Mr. Markku Lappalainen (52 years old) with passenger Ms. Marja-Liisa Hämäläinen (47 years old).

The collision between Vehicles 1 and 2 caused a chain reaction, as the impact propelled both vehicles into the northbound lanes of Tikkurila Road. Vehicle 3 was unable to avoid the colliding vehicles and struck Vehicle 1, causing it to spin again before coming to a halt.

In an attempt to avoid the collision, Vehicle 4 (2020 Hyundai i30, license plate F-JKL 901), driven by Mr. Petri Kivinen (35 years old) with passenger Ms. Anna-Liisa Mäkelä (30 years old), swerved to the right and collided with a stationary street sign on the sidewalk.

The chain reaction continued as Vehicle 2, now out of control, struck Vehicle 4 from behind, causing it to spin into the path of an oncoming vehicle, Vehicle 5 (2017 Ford Focus, license plate F-MNO 123), driven by Ms. Minna Siltala (26 years old) with passenger Mr. Jere Lehto (24 years old).

Vehicle 5 was unable to avoid the collision and struck Vehicle 4, causing it to spin again before coming to a halt. The impact caused Vehicle 5 to veer off the road and collide with a tree on the side of Tikkurila Road.

The chain reaction did not end there. As Vehicle 2 continued its path of destruction, it struck Vehicle 6 (2019 Toyota RAV4, license plate F-PQR 567), driven by Mr. Jukka Korpela (48 years old) with passenger Ms. Helena Laaksonen (45 years old).

Vehicle 2 then collided with Vehicle 7 (2016 Volvo XC90, license plate F-RST 909), driven by Mr. Jari Häkkinen (58 years old) with passenger Ms. Kirsi Miettinen (54 years old).

Finally, Vehicle 2 came to a halt after colliding with a parked vehicle, Vehicle 8 (2015 Nissan Qashqai, license plate F-TUV 345), owned by Mr. Matti Lappalainen (62 years old).

Emergency services arrived at the scene promptly and assessed the injuries of those involved in the collision. The following individuals were transported to the hospital for further treatment:

1. Juhani Mäki - Head injury, concussion
2. Sanna Niemi - Whiplash, minor cuts
3. Liisa Koskela - Whiplash, minor cuts
4. Eero Saarinen - Whiplash, minor cuts
5. Markku Lappalainen - Whiplash, minor cuts
6. Marja-Liisa Hämäläinen - Whiplash, minor cuts
7. Petri Kivinen - Whiplash, minor cuts
8. Anna-Liisa Mäkelä - Whiplash, minor cuts
9. Minna Siltala - Broken arm, concussion
10. Jere Lehto - Concussion
11. Jukka Korpela - Whiplash, minor cuts
12. Helena Laaksonen - Whiplash, minor cuts
13. Jari Häkkinen - Whiplash, minor cuts
14. Kirsi Miettinen - Whiplash, minor cuts

The overcast weather conditions and reduced visibility likely contributed to the initial failure to stop at the red traffic light by Vehicle 1, ultimately leading to the eight-vehicle collision. The road surface was wet but not icy at the time of the incident.

A thorough investigation is ongoing to determine the exact cause of the accident and any potential contributing factors. This report will be updated as more information becomes available.
