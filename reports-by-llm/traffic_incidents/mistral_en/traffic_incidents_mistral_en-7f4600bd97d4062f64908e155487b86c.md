 Title: Traffic Incident Report
Date: 25th November, 2024
Location: Kuusamo, Finland
Incident Number: KUU-241125-001

On the morning of November 25, 2024, at approximately 8:37 AM local time, a traffic incident occurred on Ounasvaaran Tie (Ounasvaara Road) near the intersection with Kumparentie (Kumpare Road), in Kuusamo. The incident involved two vehicles: a silver Toyota RAV4 (license plate FIN-ABC 123) driven by Mr. Jukka Mäki, aged 45, and a black Volkswagen Golf (license plate FIN-DEF 456) driven by Ms. Liisa Koskela, aged 38.

According to eyewitness accounts, both vehicles were traveling in the same direction when they collided due to poor visibility caused by foggy weather conditions. The incident occurred approximately 100 meters north of the intersection with Kumparentie.

Mr. Mäki was on his way to work at Ounasvaara Ski Resort, while Ms. Koskela was dropping her child off at Kumpare School. Both drivers reported no serious injuries but were shaken up by the incident.

Upon arrival at the scene, emergency services found that the front ends of both vehicles had sustained significant damage. The Toyota RAV4's bumper and grille were crushed, while the Volkswagen Golf's passenger side fender was badly dented.

The road was closed for approximately one hour to allow for the removal of debris and the assessment of the vehicles. Traffic was diverted via an alternate route during this time. The foggy weather conditions made it difficult for other motorists, but no further incidents were reported.

The incident is currently under investigation by the local police department. Both drivers have been cooperative and provided statements regarding the circumstances leading up to the collision. Preliminary findings suggest that the poor visibility due to fog may have contributed to the accident.

This report will be updated as more information becomes available.
