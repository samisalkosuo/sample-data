On the morning of July 11th, 2025, at approximately 8:30 AM local time, a multi-vehicle collision occurred on Kauppakatu (Shopping Street), near the intersection with Mannerheimintie (Mannerheim Road). The incident involved seven vehicles and resulted in minor injuries to several individuals.

The following is a detailed account of the events leading up to the incident:

1. **8:25 AM**: A 34-year-old driver identified as Mr. Jari Kivinen, driving a silver 2023 Volvo XC90 (license plate F-ABC 123) was traveling southbound on Kauppakatu at an estimated speed of 60 km/h.

2. **8:27 AM**: Approximately 2 minutes later, a gust of wind caused Mr. Kivinen to lose control of his vehicle, causing it to veer off the road and onto the sidewalk. The Volvo collided with a street lamp, which snapped and fell onto the road.

3. **8:28 AM**: A 45-year-old driver named Ms. Sanna Saarinen, driving a red 2024 Toyota Corolla (license plate F-DEF 456), was approaching the intersection from the northbound lane on Kauppakatu. Unable to see the fallen street lamp due to the low visibility caused by the wind, she failed to stop in time and collided with the Volvo.

4. **8:29 AM**: The impact of the collision caused a chain reaction, involving five additional vehicles: a blue 2025 Ford Focus (license plate F-GHI 789), a black 2023 Audi Q5 (license plate F-JKL 123), a green 2024 Hyundai Tucson (license plate F-MNO 456), a white 2023 Mercedes-Benz C-Class (license plate F-PQR 789), and a grey 2024 Mazda CX-5 (license plate F-STU 123).

5. **8:30 AM - 8:45 AM**: Emergency services, including the Luoto Police Department and local ambulance service, arrived at the scene to assess the situation and provide assistance. The road was closed for approximately one hour while the vehicles were removed and the scene was cleared.

The incident resulted in minor injuries to Ms. Saarinen, Mr. Kivinen, and two passengers in the Ford Focus. All injured parties were transported to Luoto Hospital for treatment. No fatalities were reported.

The cause of the initial collision is believed to be the gusty winds that affected visibility and control for drivers on the road. The incident remains under investigation by the Luoto Police Department's traffic unit.

Weather conditions at the time of the incident included strong, gusty winds with speeds reaching up to 30 mph. Road surfaces were wet due to light rainfall earlier in the morning.

This report is preliminary and subject to change as the investigation continues. Further updates will be provided as information becomes available.
