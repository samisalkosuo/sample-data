 Title: Traffic Incident Report
Date: January 12, 2024
Location: Nurmes, Finland
Incident Number: NUR-240112-001

On the night of January 12, 2024, at approximately 23:37 local time, a traffic incident occurred on Kauppakatu (Shopping Street) near the intersection with Linnankatu (Castle Street), in the heart of Nurmes. The incident involved two vehicles: a silver Toyota Corolla (license plate F-XYZ123) driven by Mr. Jukka Saarinen, aged 45, and a black Volkswagen Golf (license plate O-ABC987) driven by Ms. Liisa Mäki, aged 38.

According to eyewitness accounts, both vehicles were traveling in the same direction on Kauppakatu when the incident occurred. The weather conditions at the time were icy roads, which significantly impacted the driving conditions. Mr. Saarinen's Toyota Corolla lost traction on an icy patch, causing it to slide sideways into the path of Ms. Mäki's Volkswagen Golf.

The Volkswagen Golf, attempting to avoid a collision, swerved but was unable to prevent a crash. The front left bumper of the Volkswagen collided with the rear right quarter panel of the Toyota Corolla. Both vehicles sustained significant damage as a result of the impact.

Upon arrival at the scene, emergency services found both drivers unharmed but shaken. Mr. Saarinen and Ms. Mäki were cooperative and provided statements to the investigating officer. Witnesses corroborated their accounts, stating that neither driver appeared to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs.

The incident caused a temporary roadblock on Kauppakatu while emergency services attended to the scene. The road was reopened at approximately 01:30 local time after the vehicles were towed away and the debris cleared.

This report is preliminary in nature and subject to further investigation. The exact cause of the incident, including any contributing factors such as vehicle maintenance or road conditions, will be determined during the ongoing investigation.
