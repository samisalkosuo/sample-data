Incident Description:

The incident occurred on Kylämaantie, a two-lane road connecting the towns of Pyhtää and Tuusula. The location is approximately 5 kilometers northwest of the city center, near the address Kylämaantie 123.

Three vehicles were involved in the incident:

1. Vehicle A (Licence Plate: FIN-ABC 123) - A 2024 Toyota Corolla driven by Mr. Juhani Mäki, aged 35, with one passenger, Ms. Sanna Niemi, aged 32.
2. Vehicle B (Licence Plate: FIN-DEF 456) - A 2023 Volkswagen Golf driven by Mr. Marko Koskela, aged 42, with no passengers.
3. Vehicle C (Licence Plate: FIN-GHI 789) - A 2025 Hyundai Tucson driven by Ms. Liisa Lappalainen, aged 28, with one passenger, Mr. Eero Saarinen, aged 30.

According to eyewitness accounts and the investigation conducted at the scene, the incident began when Vehicle A, traveling south on Kylämaantie, approached a curve in the road. Due to the wet and slippery conditions, Mr. Mäki lost control of the vehicle, causing it to veer off the road and into the northbound lane.

At the same time, Vehicle B was traveling north on Kylämaantie at an appropriate speed for the weather conditions. Upon encountering Vehicle A in the northbound lane, Mr. Koskela was unable to avoid a collision due to the reduced visibility and wet road surface. The front ends of both vehicles collided, causing significant damage to both.

Immediately following the initial impact, Vehicle A spun out of control and came to rest on the shoulder of the road, facing south. Vehicle B continued north for approximately 50 meters before striking Vehicle C head-on. The front ends of both vehicles sustained severe damage in this collision.

Emergency services arrived at the scene within ten minutes of the initial call. All parties involved were transported to the local hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. The road was closed for approximately three hours while the incident was investigated and cleared.

The investigation is ongoing, but it appears that the primary cause of the incident was loss of control due to wet road conditions and reduced visibility. No alcohol or drug use has been detected in any of the drivers at this time.
