 Title: Traffic Incident Report

Date: October 26, 2024
Location: Föglö, Finland
Incident Number: 241026-001

On the morning of October 26, 2024, at approximately 8:37 AM local time, a traffic incident occurred on Vuosaarenkatu, near the intersection with Kustavi Road in Föglö. The incident involved two vehicles: a silver Volvo XC90 (license plate F-ABC 123) driven by Mr. Jukka Saarinen, aged 45, and a black Audi Q7 (license plate F-DEF 456) driven by Ms. Liisa Mäki, aged 38.

According to eyewitness accounts, both vehicles were traveling in the same direction on Vuosaarenkatu when the incident occurred. The road conditions at the time were reported as icy, which likely contributed to the accident. Mr. Saarinen's Volvo lost traction on a curve, skidding across the icy surface and colliding with Ms. Mäki's Audi.

The first witness, Mr. Antti Lappalainen (address: Kustavi Road 23, Föglö), reported that he saw the Volvo skid out of control before hitting the Audi. Another witness, Ms. Sanna Virtanen (address: Vuosaarenkatu 45, Föglö), confirmed this account and added that both drivers appeared to be attempting to regain control of their vehicles before the collision.

Upon arrival at the scene, emergency services found Mr. Saarinen and Ms. Mäki uninjured but shaken. Both vehicles sustained significant damage: the Volvo's front end was crumpled, while the Audi's passenger side was dented. The airbags in both vehicles had deployed.

The incident caused a temporary traffic disruption as the road was closed for approximately one hour to allow for the removal of the damaged vehicles and the investigation by local police. The road conditions were monitored closely, with salt trucks dispatched to treat the icy spots on Vuosaarenkatu.

This report is preliminary and further investigation will be conducted to determine the exact cause of the accident. Both drivers have been advised to exercise caution when driving in adverse weather conditions.
