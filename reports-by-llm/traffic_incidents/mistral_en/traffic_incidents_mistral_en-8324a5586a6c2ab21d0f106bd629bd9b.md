On the night of July 29th, 2025, at approximately 11:30 PM, a multi-vehicle collision occurred on the Tievesiementie (Highway 6) near the intersection with Kauppakatu (Main Street), in the municipality of Kitee, Finland.

The incident involved nine vehicles, as follows:

1. Vehicle 1 - A silver 2024 Volvo XC90 (license plate F-ABC 123) driven by Mr. Juhani Mäki (age 45, resident of Kauppakatu 12) traveling southbound on Tievesiementie.
2. Vehicle 2 - A black 2023 Toyota Corolla (license plate X-DEF 456) driven by Ms. Sanna Koskela (age 32, resident of Kauppakatu 21) also traveling southbound on Tievesiementie, immediately behind Mr. Mäki's vehicle.
3. Vehicle 3 - A red 2025 Ford Mustang (license plate G-HIJ 789) driven by Mr. Marko Saari (age 28, resident of Kauppakatu 34), overtaking both vehicles 1 and 2 from the left lane.
4. Vehicle 4 - A blue 2025 Hyundai Santa Fe (license plate J-KLM 901) driven by Ms. Liisa Nurmi (age 56, resident of Kauppakatu 45), traveling northbound on Tievesiementie.
5. Vehicle 5 - A green 2023 Nissan Qashqai (license plate L-NOP 123) driven by Mr. Eero Penttinen (age 68, resident of Kauppakatu 56), also traveling northbound on Tievesiementie, immediately behind Ms. Nurmi's vehicle.
6. Vehicle 6 - A white 2024 Mercedes-Benz C-Class (license plate M-OQR 567) driven by Mr. Antti Hämäläinen (age 38, resident of Kauppakatu 67), traveling northbound on Tievesiementie and attempting to turn left onto Kauppakatu at the intersection.
7. Vehicle 7 - A yellow 2025 Mazda CX-5 (license plate N-PST 890) driven by Ms. Anna Lehto (age 24, resident of Kauppakatu 78), traveling northbound on Tievesiementie and also attempting to turn left onto Kauppakatu at the intersection.
8. Vehicle 8 - A black 2023 Volkswagen Golf (license plate O-UVW 987) driven by Mr. Jari Laaksonen (age 51, resident of Kauppakatu 89), traveling southbound on Tievesiementie and approaching the intersection at high speed.
9. Vehicle 9 - A grey 2024 Peugeot 3008 (license plate P-XYZ 123) driven by Ms. Marja Kivinen (age 47, resident of Kauppakatu 99), traveling southbound on Tievesiementie and immediately behind Mr. Laaksonen's vehicle.

The clear and sunny weather conditions contributed to the visibility of the road, but the late hour may have affected the drivers' alertness. The road surface was dry, and there were no reported obstructions or adverse weather conditions at the time of the incident.

According to eyewitness accounts, Mr. Saari (vehicle 3) was overtaking vehicles 1 and 2 in the left lane when he lost control of his vehicle due to excessive speed. The Ford Mustang veered across the median into the northbound lanes, colliding with Ms. Nurmi's (vehicle 4) Hyundai Santa Fe.

The impact caused both vehicles to spin out of control and block the northbound lanes. Meanwhile, Mr. Hämäläinen (vehicle 6) and Ms. Lehto (vehicle 7), who were turning left onto Kauppakatu at the intersection, did not have enough time to react and collided with the spinning vehicles.

The subsequent chain reaction involved vehicles 8 and 9, which were unable to stop in time and also collided with the already-involved vehicles.

Emergency services arrived on the scene within minutes and provided medical attention to those injured. The road was closed for several hours while the accident investigation took place and the vehicles were removed.

The exact cause of the incident is still under investigation, but it appears that excessive speed and reckless driving may have played a significant role in the collision. Further analysis will be conducted to determine any contributing factors, such as alcohol or drug impairment.

This report is based on eyewitness accounts, police observations at the scene, and preliminary investigations. The investigation is ongoing, and updates will be provided as more information becomes available.
