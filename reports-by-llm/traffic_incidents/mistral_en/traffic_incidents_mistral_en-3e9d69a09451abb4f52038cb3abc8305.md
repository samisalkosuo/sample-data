 Title: Traffic Incident Report - Mäntyharju, Finland - 23.07.2024, 11:30 PM

On July 23rd, 2024, at approximately 11:30 PM, a multi-vehicle collision occurred on the outskirts of Mäntyharju, Finland, involving eight vehicles. The incident took place on Kylänkatu (Village Street), near the intersection with Rantatie (Coastal Road).

The following is a detailed account of the events leading up to and including the collision:

1. Initial Incident (11:28 PM)
   - A 35-year-old male driver identified as Mr. Jukka Lehto, driving a 2024 Volvo XC90 with license plate F-ABC 123, was traveling southbound on Kylänkatu at an estimated speed of 70 km/h in a 60 km/h zone.
   - Mr. Lehto failed to notice a slowing traffic ahead due to a temporary roadwork zone and attempted to swerve to the right lane to avoid the congestion, causing his vehicle to lose control.

2. Chain Reaction (11:29 PM)
   - As Mr. Lehto's vehicle veered into the right lane, it collided with a 2024 Toyota Corolla driven by a 28-year-old female driver, Ms. Liisa Mäki, who was traveling in the same direction. Ms. Mäki's vehicle, F-DEF 456, sustained significant front-end damage as a result of the impact.
   - The force of the collision caused Mr. Lehto's Volvo to spin out of control and cross into the oncoming northbound lane, where it collided with a 2023 Ford Mustang driven by a 45-year-old male driver, Mr. Eero Saari (F-GHI 789).
   - The impact caused Mr. Saari's vehicle to spin and collide with a stationary construction truck parked on the side of the road.

3. Secondary Collisions (11:30 PM)
   - As the chain reaction continued, a northbound 2024 Audi Q7 driven by a 58-year-old male driver, Mr. Juhani Koskela (F-JKL 901), attempted to avoid the collision but was unable to do so and collided with Mr. Lehto's Volvo.
   - The Audi sustained significant front-end damage and came to a stop partially blocking the southbound lane.
   - Meanwhile, a northbound 2023 Mercedes-Benz E-Class driven by a 32-year-old male driver, Mr. Marko Hämäläinen (F-MNO 123), swerved to avoid the collision but lost control and collided with a parked 2024 Hyundai Santa Fe on the side of the road.
   - The Mercedes sustained significant front-end damage and came to a stop partially blocking the northbound lane.

4. Witness Accounts
   - A passerby, Ms. Sini Niemi, who was walking her dog near the scene, reported hearing a series of loud collisions and immediately called emergency services. She provided a detailed account of the incident to responding officers.
   - Another witness, Mr. Jari Kivinen, who was driving home from work, stopped his vehicle and assisted in providing first aid to injured parties until paramedics arrived on the scene.

The clear and sunny weather conditions contributed to good visibility for witnesses but may have played a role in the initial incident by causing a glare on the road surface. The road was dry at the time of the collision, and there were no reported mechanical issues with any of the vehicles involved.

Emergency services arrived on the scene within 10 minutes of the initial call. All injured parties were transported to Mäntyharju Hospital for treatment. The extent and nature of their injuries are currently unknown.

The road was closed for approximately four hours while the scene was investigated and cleared. Traffic was diverted via alternate routes during this time.

This report will be forwarded to the appropriate authorities for further investigation and determination of fault.
