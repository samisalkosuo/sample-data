On the day of May 15th, 2024, at approximately 14:37 hours, a traffic incident occurred on Vuokkijärventie (Highway 8), Kempele. The incident involved two vehicles and was witnessed by several passersby.

The first vehicle involved in the accident was a silver Volvo XC60 with license plate number F-ABC 123, driven by Mr. Jukka Saarinen (45 years old) and carrying one passenger, Ms. Liisa Mäki (38 years old). The second vehicle was a black Audi Q7 with license plate number O-DEF 456, driven by Ms. Sanna Koskela (29 years old), who was alone in the car at the time of the incident.

According to eyewitness accounts, Mr. Saarinen was traveling southbound on Vuokkijärventie, while Ms. Koskela was heading northbound. As they approached the intersection with Kempeleentie (Road 85), both drivers failed to notice the traffic light turning red due to the poor visibility caused by light rain.

Mr. Saarinen attempted to stop his Volvo but, due to the wet road conditions, he was unable to do so in time. As a result, the front of his vehicle collided with the left side of Ms. Koskela's Audi. The impact caused both vehicles to spin out of control and come to a halt on the opposite sides of the intersection.

Upon arrival at the scene, emergency services found that Mr. Saarinen and Ms. Mäki were uninjured but shaken up. Ms. Koskela was transported to Kempele Hospital for precautionary checks due to complaints of neck pain.

The Volvo sustained significant damage to its front bumper, grille, and left headlight, while the Audi had damage to its passenger side door, fender, and wheel. Both vehicles were towed away from the scene for further inspection and repairs.

The incident caused minor traffic disruptions as emergency services worked to clear the road and assist those involved. The police are reminding drivers to exercise caution during adverse weather conditions and to always obey traffic signals to ensure the safety of all road users.
