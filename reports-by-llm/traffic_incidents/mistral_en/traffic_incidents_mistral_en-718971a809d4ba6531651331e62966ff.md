Incident Description:
On the morning of February 28th, 2025, in Sipoo, Finland, a multi-vehicle collision occurred near the intersection of Tikkurila Road and Kaukokoski Street due to foggy weather conditions that significantly reduced visibility.

According to witness statements, Mr. Mäki (Vehicle 1) was traveling south on Tikkurila Road at approximately 60 km/h when he failed to notice the stopped traffic ahead due to the dense fog. Unable to stop in time, his Volvo XC90 collided with Ms. Koskela's Mercedes E-Class (Vehicle 2), which was waiting at a red light on Kaukokoski Street.

The impact caused Ms. Koskela's vehicle to spin out of control and move diagonally across Tikkurila Road, where it collided with Mr. Saarinen's Toyota Corolla (Vehicle 3) that was traveling east on Tikkurila Road. The force of the collision caused Mr. Saarinen's vehicle to spin as well, blocking the eastbound lane.

Meanwhile, Ms. Lehtonen (Vehicle 4), who was approaching the intersection from Kaukokoski Street, did not have enough time to react and collided with the rear of Mr. Mäki's Volvo XC90. The impact caused her Ford Focus to spin and come to a stop in the northbound lane of Tikkurila Road.

Finally, Mr. Hämäläinen (Vehicle 5) was traveling south on Tikkurila Road behind Mr. Mäki when he saw the accident unfold. Unable to avoid the collision, his Peugeot 308 hit the rear of Ms. Lehtonen's Ford Focus.

Emergency services arrived at the scene shortly after the incident and provided medical attention to those injured. The road was closed for several hours while the vehicles were removed and the scene was investigated.

Preliminary findings suggest that Mr. Mäki may have been driving too fast for the weather conditions, which contributed to the accident. Further investigation is ongoing to determine the exact cause of the collision and any potential contributing factors.
