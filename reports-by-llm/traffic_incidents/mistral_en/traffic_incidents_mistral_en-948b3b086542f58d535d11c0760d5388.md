 Title: Traffic Incident Report
Date: February 26, 2024
Location: Sund, Finland
Incident Number: SU-24-03789

On the evening of February 26, 2024, at approximately 19:35 hours, a traffic incident occurred on Kauppakatu (Shopping Street) near the intersection with Linnankatu (Castle Street), Sund. The incident involved two vehicles: a silver Volvo XC90 (license plate F-ABC 123) driven by Mr. Juhani Särkijärvi, aged 45, and a black Audi Q7 (license plate O-DEF 456) driven by Ms. Liisa Mäkelä, aged 38.

According to eyewitness accounts, both vehicles were traveling in the same direction on Kauppakatu when the incident occurred. Mr. Särkijärvi was approaching the intersection at a moderate speed due to the mixed snow and rain conditions, while Ms. Mäkelä was following closely behind. As Mr. Särkijärvi slowed down to make a right turn onto Linnankatu, Ms. Mäkelä failed to react in time and collided with the rear of his vehicle.

The impact caused both vehicles to spin out of control, with the Volvo coming to rest against a streetlight pole on the corner of the intersection, while the Audi came to a stop further down Kauppakatu. The collision resulted in significant damage to both vehicles, with the Volvo sustaining damage to its rear bumper and taillights, as well as a shattered rear window. The Audi, on the other hand, suffered front-end damage, including a crumpled hood and damaged headlights.

Emergency services were promptly dispatched to the scene, with an ambulance arriving at 19:40 hours. Both drivers and passengers reported no serious injuries, although Mr. Särkijärvi complained of neck pain and Ms. Mäkelä's left arm was immobilized due to suspected fractures. They were transported to Sund Hospital for further evaluation and treatment.

The road was closed for approximately two hours while the incident was investigated and cleared. The weather conditions, combined with poor visibility, were determined to have contributed to the accident. Witness statements were taken from four individuals who stopped to assist at the scene, and both drivers were issued traffic violation notices for following too closely.

This report is preliminary in nature and subject to further investigation by the Sund Police Department's Traffic Investigation Unit. The incident number will be updated as more information becomes available.
