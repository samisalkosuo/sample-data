Incident Number: TI-2025-KO-001

On the day of January 29th, 2025, at approximately 14:37 hours, a traffic incident occurred on Väinö Linna Street (County Road 186), Kökar. The incident involved two vehicles and resulted in minor injuries to one party.

The first vehicle involved was a silver 2023 Volvo XC90 with license plate FIN-ABC 123, driven by Mr. Juhani Mäki (58 years old) and carrying Mrs. Sari Mäki (56 years old) as passengers. The second vehicle involved was a red 2024 Toyota Corolla with license plate FIN-DEF 456, driven by Ms. Liisa Virtanen (35 years old).

According to eyewitness accounts, Mr. Mäki was driving southbound on Väinö Linna Street when he failed to stop at a red traffic light located at the intersection with Kaisa Rintala Street. The Volvo XC90 collided with the Toyota Corolla, which was traveling eastbound on Kaisa Rintala Street and had the right of way.

The impact caused both vehicles to spin out of control, with the Volvo XC90 coming to a halt in the northbound lane of Väinö Linna Street, while the Toyota Corolla came to rest on the sidewalk adjacent to Kaisa Rintala Street.

Upon arrival at the scene, emergency services found that Mrs. Sari Mäki had sustained minor injuries and was transported to the local hospital for further evaluation and treatment. Ms. Liisa Virtanen reported no immediate injuries but was visibly shaken.

The weather conditions at the time of the incident were dry but cold, with temperatures hovering around -5°C (23°F). The road surfaces were icy in some areas due to the recent drop in temperature, which may have contributed to the loss of control by both vehicles.

Upon inspection, it was determined that the Volvo XC90 had sustained significant front-end damage, with the bumper and grille being crushed against the radiator. The Toyota Corolla, on the other hand, had moderate damage to its passenger side, including a dented door and damaged wheel.

The incident is currently under investigation by local authorities, with a focus on determining whether Mr. Mäki was impaired or distracted at the time of the collision. Witness statements are being collected, and further evidence will be gathered from both vehicles and the traffic light system.

This report is preliminary in nature and subject to change as the investigation progresses. Updates will be provided as necessary.
