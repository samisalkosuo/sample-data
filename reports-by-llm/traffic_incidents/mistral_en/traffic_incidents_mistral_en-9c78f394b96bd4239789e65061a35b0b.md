 Title: Traffic Incident Report
Date: September 30, 2023
Location: Joutsa, Finland
Incident Number: 23-14567

On the night of September 30, 2023, at approximately 23:30 local time, a traffic incident occurred on Kylänkatu (Village Street) near the intersection with Mäkelänkuja (Makela Lane), in the heart of Joutsa. The incident involved two vehicles: a silver Volkswagen Golf TSI bearing Finnish license plate FAB 1234 and a black Toyota Corolla Hybrid with the license plate XYZ 5678.

Witnesses at the scene reported that the Volkswagen, driven by Mr. Juhani Mäkelä (age 35, resident of Kylänkatu 21), was traveling southbound on Kylänkatu when it failed to stop at the stop sign at the intersection with Mäkelänkuja. The vehicle proceeded into the path of the oncoming Toyota Corolla, driven by Ms. Liisa Koskela (age 42, resident of Mäkelänkuja 37), who was traveling westbound on Mäkelänkuja.

Ms. Koskela attempted to swerve to avoid the collision but was unable to do so, resulting in a T-bone impact on the driver's side of her vehicle. Both vehicles sustained significant damage as a result of the impact.

Upon arrival at the scene, emergency services found both drivers uninjured but shaken. Mr. Mäkelä admitted to momentarily falling asleep at the wheel due to fatigue. Ms. Koskela was visibly upset but declined medical attention.

The clear and sunny weather conditions contributed to good visibility, while the quiet night allowed for minimal external distractions. However, the lack of streetlights in the area made it difficult for Mr. Mäkelä to see the stop sign at the intersection, which may have played a role in the incident.

The road surface was dry and in good condition, with no evidence of ice or other hazards that could have contributed to the accident. The vehicles were towed from the scene, and the incident is currently under investigation by local authorities.

This report is based on witness statements, physical evidence at the scene, and interviews with both drivers. Further analysis will be conducted to determine the exact cause of the incident and any potential contributing factors.
