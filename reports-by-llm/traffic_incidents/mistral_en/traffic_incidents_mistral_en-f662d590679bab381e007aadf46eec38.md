Location: Muhos, Finland
Incident Number: TI-241117-001

On the day of November 17, 2024, at approximately 14:35 hours, a traffic incident occurred on Kauppakatu (Shopping Street) near the intersection with Linnankatu (Castle Street), Muhos. The incident involved two vehicles: a silver Toyota Corolla (license plate F-ABC 123) driven by Mr. Jukka Saarinen, aged 45, and a red Volkswagen Golf (license plate X-DEF 456) driven by Ms. Liisa Mäki, aged 38.

According to eyewitness accounts, both vehicles were traveling in the same direction on Kauppakatu when strong gusts of wind caused Mr. Saarinen's Toyota Corolla to veer off its lane and collide with Ms. Mäki's Volkswagen Golf. The impact was significant, causing both vehicles to spin out of control before coming to a halt on the opposite side of the road.

The incident occurred during the daytime, with windy conditions that made it difficult for drivers to maintain control of their vehicles. Witnesses reported seeing debris scattered across the road due to the collision, further complicating traffic flow in the area.

Upon arrival at the scene, emergency services found both Mr. Saarinen and Ms. Mäki uninjured but shaken. The Toyota Corolla sustained damage to its front bumper and passenger side door, while the Volkswagen Golf had damage to its driver's side and rear bumper.

The incident caused temporary road closures in the area as emergency services worked to clear debris and assess the scene. Traffic was diverted through alternate routes during this time. The road reopened at approximately 16:00 hours, following a thorough investigation by local authorities.

This report is preliminary and subject to further investigation. If anyone has information regarding this incident, they are encouraged to contact the Muhos Police Department at (08) 555-1234.
