Location: Sotkamo, Finland
Incident Number: 2023-SOT-0001

On the morning of January 8th, 2023, at approximately 07:45, a traffic incident occurred on Kauppakatu (Shopping Street) near the intersection with Linnankatu (Castle Street), in Sotkamo. The incident involved two vehicles: a silver Volvo XC60 with license plate F-XYZ123, driven by Mr. Juhani M채ki (45 years old), and a red Toyota Corolla with license plate O-ABC987, driven by Ms. Liisa Koskela (32 years old).

According to eyewitness accounts, both vehicles were traveling in the same direction on Kauppakatu when heavy rain began to fall, significantly reducing visibility and causing slippery road conditions. As Mr. M채ki approached the intersection with Linnankatu, he failed to stop at the red light due to the poor weather conditions. The Toyota Corolla, driven by Ms. Koskela, was unable to stop in time and collided with the driver's side of the Volvo XC60.

The impact caused both vehicles to spin out of control, blocking the intersection and causing minor traffic disruptions. Emergency services arrived at the scene within 10 minutes, and both drivers were assessed for injuries. Mr. M채ki complained of neck pain, while Ms. Koskela reported dizziness. Both were transported to Sotkamo Hospital for further evaluation and treatment.

The Volvo XC60 sustained significant damage to the driver's side, with the front fender and door being crushed. The Toyota Corolla also suffered damage to the front end, with the bumper and grille being deformed. Both vehicles were towed from the scene for further inspection and repairs.

The incident is currently under investigation by the Sotkamo Police Department. Charges are pending against Mr. M채ki for failing to stop at a red light, which is believed to have contributed to the collision. The heavy rain and slippery road conditions are also being considered as contributing factors in the incident.

This report will be updated as more information becomes available.
