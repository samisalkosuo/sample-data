 Title: Traffic Incident Report
Date: May 27, 2025
Location: Heinola, Finland
Incident Number: HIN-250527-001

On the night of May 27, 2025, at approximately 23:45 local time, a traffic incident occurred on Mäkelänkatu (Mäkelä Street) near the intersection with Kauppakatu (Shopping Street), in the heart of Heinola. The incident involved two vehicles: a silver Volvo XC90 (license plate FIN-ABC 123) driven by Mr. Juhani Mäkelä, aged 45, and a black Audi Q7 (license plate FIN-DEF 456) driven by Ms. Liisa Kauppa, aged 38.

According to eyewitness accounts, both vehicles were traveling in opposite directions when the incident occurred. Mr. Mäkelä was heading north on Mäkelänkatu, while Ms. Kauppa was traveling south. The snowy conditions and reduced visibility due to falling snowflakes made it difficult for drivers to maintain a safe distance.

The Volvo XC90, driven by Mr. Mäkelä, lost traction on the icy road, causing it to slide sideways into the path of the oncoming Audi Q7. Despite Ms. Kauppa's attempts to avoid the collision, the two vehicles collided in the intersection, with the front ends of both vehicles sustaining significant damage.

Immediately following the impact, both drivers and passengers exited their vehicles and moved to a safe location on the sidewalk. No injuries were reported among the four occupants, but all parties involved appeared shaken by the incident.

The police arrived at the scene within minutes, along with emergency medical services and a tow truck. The road was closed for approximately two hours while the incident was investigated and the vehicles were removed.

During the investigation, it was determined that Mr. Mäkelä had been driving at an excessive speed for the snowy conditions, contributing to his loss of control. No charges have been filed as of this report, but the investigation is ongoing.

This incident serves as a reminder to all drivers to exercise caution and adhere to speed limits, especially during adverse weather conditions. The police would like to thank the witnesses who came forward to provide statements and assist in the investigation.
