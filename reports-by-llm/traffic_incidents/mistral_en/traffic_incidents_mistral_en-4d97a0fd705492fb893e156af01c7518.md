 Title: Traffic Incident Report
Date: October 26, 2024
Location: Tervola, Finland
Incident Number: 241026-T-001

On the night of October 26, 2024, at approximately 23:37 hours, a three-vehicle collision occurred on Kauppakatu (Shopping Street) near the intersection with Linnankatu (Castle Street), in Tervola. The incident involved vehicles driven by Mr. Jari Mäki (Vehicle A), Ms. Liisa Koskela (Vehicle B), and Mr. Antti Nurmi (Vehicle C).

According to eyewitness accounts, Mr. Mäki was driving a 2023 Volvo XC90 (license plate F-ABC 123) southbound on Kauppakatu at an estimated speed of 60 km/h. Ms. Koskela, in a 2024 Toyota Corolla Hybrid (license plate O-DEF 456), was traveling northbound on the same street at approximately 50 km/h. Mr. Nurmi, driving a 2023 Ford Focus ST (license plate G-HIJ 789), was parked on the eastern curb of Kauppakatu, waiting to make a left turn onto Linnankatu.

As Mr. Mäki approached the intersection, he failed to notice that Mr. Nurmi's vehicle had begun to enter the intersection. In an attempt to avoid a collision, Ms. Koskela swerved her Corolla to the right, but due to the overcast weather conditions and poor visibility, she was unable to fully avoid the impact.

The front left bumper of Mr. Mäki's Volvo collided with the rear passenger side of Ms. Koskela's Toyota, causing both vehicles to spin out of control. As they spun, the front right bumper of Mr. Mäki's vehicle struck the driver's side door of Mr. Nurmi's Ford Focus ST, which was still partially in the intersection.

Emergency services arrived at the scene within 8 minutes and provided medical attention to those involved. Ms. Koskela sustained minor injuries and was transported to Tervola Hospital for further evaluation. Both Mr. Mäki and Mr. Nurmi were uninjured but shaken by the incident.

The road was closed for approximately two hours while the vehicles were removed and the scene was investigated. The overcast weather conditions contributed to poor visibility, which may have played a role in the initial collision. No alcohol or drug impairment was suspected at the time of this report.

This incident is currently under investigation by the Tervola Police Department's Traffic Investigation Unit. Further updates will be provided as the investigation progresses.
