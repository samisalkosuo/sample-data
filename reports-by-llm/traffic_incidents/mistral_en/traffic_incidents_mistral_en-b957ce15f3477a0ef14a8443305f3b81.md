 Title: Traffic Incident Report
Date: November 29, 2024
Location: Mikkeli, Finland
Incident Number: MIK-241129-001

On the day of November 29, 2024, at approximately 3:15 PM local time, a traffic incident occurred on Kauppakatu (Shopping Street) near the intersection with Linnankatu (Castle Street), in the heart of Mikkeli. The incident involved two vehicles: a silver Toyota Corolla (license plate F-ABC 123) driven by Mr. Jukka Saarinen, aged 45, and a black Volkswagen Golf (license plate X-DEF 456) driven by Ms. Liisa M채ki, aged 38.

According to eyewitness accounts, both vehicles were traveling in the same direction on Kauppakatu when the incident occurred. The weather conditions at the time were unfavorable, with a heavy thunderstorm causing poor visibility and slippery road surfaces.

The sequence of events began as Mr. Saarinen, who was driving the Toyota Corolla, approached the intersection with Linnankatu. Due to the heavy rain and reduced visibility, he failed to notice that Ms. M채ki's Volkswagen Golf had stopped at a red light at the intersection. As a result, Mr. Saarinen's vehicle collided with the rear of Ms. M채ki's car, causing both vehicles to spin out of control and come to a halt on the opposite side of Kauppakatu.

Upon arrival, emergency services found no injuries among the drivers or passengers involved in the incident. Both Mr. Saarinen and Ms. M채ki were visibly shaken but otherwise unharmed. Witnesses at the scene reported that neither driver appeared to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs.

The Toyota Corolla sustained significant damage to its front bumper, grille, and windshield, while the Volkswagen Golf's rear end was severely damaged. Both vehicles were towed away from the scene for further inspection and repairs.

The incident caused minor traffic disruptions in the area, with police diverting traffic around the accident site until the cleanup and investigation were completed. The road conditions, combined with the heavy rainfall, made it difficult to clear the debris promptly.

As part of the ongoing investigation, statements from eyewitnesses will be collected, and both drivers' driving records will be reviewed. The incident report will be forwarded to the appropriate authorities for further action, if necessary.

This concludes the preliminary traffic incident report for MIK-241129-001. Further updates will be provided as the investigation progresses.
