Location: Tohmajärvi, Finland
Incident Number: 2345678910

On the evening of May 6th, 2025, at approximately 19:37 hours, a traffic incident occurred on Kauppakatu (Shopping Street) near the intersection with Mannerheimintie (Mannerheim Avenue), Tohmajärvi. The incident involved two vehicles: a silver Toyota Corolla (license plate F-ABC 123) driven by Mr. Juhani Särkijärvi, aged 45, and a black Volkswagen Golf (license plate O-DEF 456) driven by Ms. Liisa Mäkelä, aged 38.

According to eyewitness accounts, both vehicles were traveling in the same direction on Kauppakatu when the incident occurred. Mr. Särkijärvi's Toyota Corolla was approaching the intersection at a speed estimated between 60-70 km/h, while Ms. Mäkelä's Volkswagen Golf was maintaining a safe distance of approximately 100 meters ahead.

As Mr. Särkijärvi approached the intersection, he failed to notice that Ms. Mäkelä had slowed down due to heavy traffic ahead. In an attempt to overtake the Golf, Mr. Särkijärvi's Corolla swerved into the oncoming lane, colliding with a delivery truck (license plate X-GHI 987) that was traveling in the opposite direction. The impact caused the Corolla to spin out of control and come to rest on the sidewalk, while the Golf veered back onto Kauppakatu and came to a stop near the intersection.

The delivery truck driver, Mr. Eero Penttilä, aged 52, was unharmed in the incident. Both Mr. Särkijärvi and Ms. Mäkelä sustained minor injuries and were transported to Tohmajärvi Hospital for treatment.

At the time of the incident, the weather conditions were light rain, reducing visibility and creating slippery road surfaces. The rain had been falling steadily throughout the evening, contributing to the slick roads and reduced traction for the vehicles involved.

The scene was secured by local law enforcement and emergency services, who arrived within minutes of the incident being reported. Traffic in the area was diverted while the investigation and cleanup were underway. The damaged vehicles were towed away, and the road was reopened at approximately 21:45 hours.

The incident is currently under investigation by the Tohmajärvi Police Department's traffic unit. Preliminary findings suggest that Mr. Särkijärvi may have been driving recklessly and failed to maintain a safe following distance, leading to the collision. Charges are pending further investigation and any necessary witness statements.
