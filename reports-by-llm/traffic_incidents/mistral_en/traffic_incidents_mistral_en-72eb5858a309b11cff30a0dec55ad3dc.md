 Traffic Incident Report

Date: 14.01.2023
Location: Perho, Finland
Incident Time: 08:37 AM (local time)
Weather Conditions: Mixed snow and rain

Upon arrival at the scene on Kauppakatu Street, near the intersection with Linnankatu, I found a multi-vehicle collision involving nine vehicles. The incident occurred in the morning rush hour, with poor visibility due to mixed snow and rain conditions.

The first vehicle involved was a silver Volvo XC90 (license plate F-ABC 123) driven by Mr. Jari Mäki (age 45, resident of Kauppakatu 21). Witness statements suggest that Mr. Mäki lost control of his vehicle while attempting to navigate the slippery road, causing him to slide into the path of an oncoming Toyota Corolla (license plate X-DEF 456) driven by Ms. Liisa Koskela (age 32, resident of Linnankatu 17).

Ms. Koskela was unable to avoid colliding with Mr. Mäki's vehicle and swerved into the path of a third vehicle, a red Ford Focus (license plate G-HIJ 789) driven by Mr. Marko Saari (age 28, resident of Kauppakatu 35). The chain reaction continued as each subsequent vehicle attempted to avoid the initial collision, resulting in a total of nine vehicles being involved in the incident.

Witnesses at the scene reported that the road conditions were treacherous due to the mixed snow and rain, making it difficult for drivers to maintain control of their vehicles. Mr. Mäki, Ms. Koskela, and Mr. Saari all sustained minor injuries but were able to exit their vehicles without assistance.

The following vehicles were involved in the incident:

1. Silver Volvo XC90 (license plate F-ABC 123) - Driver: Jari Mäki; Passengers: 2 (minor injuries)

The vehicles sustained various degrees of damage, with the Volvo XC90 and Toyota Corolla suffering the most extensive damage. The incident caused significant traffic disruptions in the area, with emergency services taking approximately two hours to clear the scene and reopen the road.

This report is being submitted for further investigation into the cause of the accident and any potential contributing factors, such as road conditions or driver error.
