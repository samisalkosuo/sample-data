 Traffic Incident Report

Date: August 23, 2024
Location: Kristiinankaupunki, Finland
Incident Number: TI-240823-001

On the day of August 23, 2024, at approximately 15:37 hours, a traffic incident occurred on Vuoksenkatu, near the intersection with Kauppakatu. The incident involved three vehicles and resulted in minor injuries to several individuals.

The following is a detailed account of the events leading up to the incident:

Vehicle 1 (Licence Plate: FIN-ABC 123) was traveling westbound on Vuoksenkatu, driven by Mr. Juhani Mäki (age 45). The vehicle, a 2022 Toyota Corolla Hybrid, was proceeding at an estimated speed of 60 km/h.

Simultaneously, Vehicle 2 (Licence Plate: FIN-DEF 456), a 2018 Volkswagen Golf driven by Ms. Sanna Niemi (age 32), was approaching the same intersection from Kauppakatu, heading southbound. Ms. Niemi was estimated to be traveling at approximately 40 km/h.

As Vehicle 2 entered the intersection, it failed to yield right-of-way to oncoming traffic and collided with Vehicle 1. The impact caused both vehicles to spin out of control, with Vehicle 1 veering onto the northbound lane of Vuoksenkatu and striking a stationary vehicle, Vehicle 3 (Licence Plate: FIN-GHI 789), parked on the side of the road.

Vehicle 3, a 2015 Ford Focus, was owned by Mr. Markku Santala (age 64) and was unoccupied at the time of the incident.

Witnesses at the scene reported that visibility had been significantly reduced due to foggy weather conditions, which may have contributed to Ms. Niemi's failure to yield right-of-way. The road surface was wet but otherwise clear, with no evidence of debris or other contributing factors.

Upon arrival, emergency services found that Mr. Mäki and one passenger in Vehicle 1 (Ms. Liisa Lappalainen, age 42) had sustained minor injuries as a result of the collision. Both were transported to Kristiinankaupunki Hospital for further evaluation and treatment. Ms. Niemi also reported minor injuries but declined transportation to the hospital.

The incident caused significant traffic disruption in the area, with Vuoksenkatu being closed for approximately two hours while the scene was cleared and investigated. The vehicles involved were towed away for further examination and assessment of damage.

This report will be forwarded to the appropriate authorities for further investigation and potential charges against Ms. Niemi for failure to yield right-of-way, contributing to the traffic incident.
