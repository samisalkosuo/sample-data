 Title: Traffic Incident Report
Date: 12.11.2024
Location: Ranua, Finland
Incident Number: RAN-241112-001

On the night of November 12th, 2024, a traffic incident occurred on Kauppakatu (Shopping Street) near the intersection with Linnankatu (Castle Street), in the heart of Ranua. The incident involved two vehicles: a silver Toyota Corolla (license plate F-ABC 123) driven by Mr. Juhani M채ki, aged 45, and a black Volkswagen Golf (license plate XYZ 987) driven by Ms. Sanna Koskela, aged 32.

At approximately 23:30, Mr. M채ki was driving southbound on Kauppakatu, approaching the intersection with Linnankatu. Ms. Koskela was traveling eastbound on Linnankatu, intending to turn left onto Kauppakatu. The foggy conditions made visibility poor, and both drivers reported difficulty seeing other vehicles.

As Ms. Koskela began her left turn, she failed to notice the approaching Toyota Corolla due to the fog. Mr. M채ki, unable to stop in time due to the slippery road surface caused by the fog, collided with the Volkswagen Golf at the intersection. The impact caused both vehicles to spin out of control before coming to a halt on the opposite sides of the intersection.

Witnesses reported hearing screeching tires and a loud crash, followed by the sound of airbags deploying in both vehicles. A passerby, Mr. Eero Saari, aged 50, stopped his vehicle and called emergency services immediately. Other witnesses provided assistance to those involved until the arrival of medical and police personnel.

Upon inspection, it was determined that the Toyota Corolla sustained significant front-end damage, with the bumper and hood crushed. The Volkswagen Golf suffered similar damage to its passenger side, with the door and fender severely dented. Both drivers and passengers were wearing seatbelts and airbags deployed successfully, minimizing injuries.

Mr. M채ki and Ms. Koskela were transported to Ranua Hospital for further evaluation and treatment of minor injuries. The road was closed for approximately two hours while the incident was investigated and cleared.

This report is preliminary in nature and subject to further investigation by the Ranua Police Department's Traffic Unit. The cause of the accident appears to be a failure to yield right-of-way due to poor visibility caused by foggy conditions, combined with slippery road surfaces. Recommendations for improved signage, lighting, and driver education will be considered in light of this incident.
