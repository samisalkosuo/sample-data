 Title: Traffic Incident Report
Date: March 30, 2023
Location: Karijoki, Finland
Incident Number: KJ-230330-001

On the night of March 30, 2023, at approximately 23:45 local time, a traffic incident occurred on Tietotie (Information Road), near the intersection with Koulukatu (School Street). The incident involved two vehicles: a silver Volvo V60 with license plate FIN-ABC123 and a black Mercedes C-Class with license plate FIN-DEF456.

Witness statements suggest that the Volvo, driven by Mr. Jari M채ki (38), was traveling southbound on Tietotie at an estimated speed of 70 km/h. The Mercedes, driven by Ms. Liisa Koskela (42), was approaching from the opposite direction, also at a high speed, estimated to be around 65 km/h.

As both vehicles approached the intersection, the wet and slippery road conditions caused Ms. Koskela's Mercedes to lose traction, leading it to slide into the path of Mr. M채ki's Volvo. The front ends of both vehicles collided, causing significant damage to both.

Mr. M채ki and his passenger, Mrs. Sari M채ki (35), were unharmed in the incident. Ms. Koskela sustained minor injuries and was transported to the local hospital for treatment. No other parties were involved or injured in the incident.

The road was closed for approximately two hours while emergency services attended to the scene, and the vehicles were towed away. The incident is currently under investigation by the Karijoki Police Department's traffic unit.

Weather conditions at the time of the incident included wet roads due to light rainfall and slippery surfaces due to low temperatures. Road signs warning of the weather conditions were present, but it is unclear whether either driver took notice of them.

This report will be updated as more information becomes available.
