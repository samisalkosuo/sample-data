 Title: Traffic Incident Report
Date: 05.04.2023
Location: Ylivieska, Finland
Incident Number: 23-16789

On the morning of April 5th, 2023, at approximately 08:37 AM local time, a traffic incident occurred on Kauppakatu (Shopping Street) near the intersection with Linnankatu (Castle Street), in Ylivieska. The incident involved two vehicles: a silver Volvo V60 with license plate F-XYZ123, driven by Mr. Juhani Mäki (45 years old), and a black Audi Q5 with license plate O-ABC987, driven by Ms. Sanna Koskela (32 years old).

Mr. Mäki was traveling southbound on Kauppakatu, while Ms. Koskela was heading east on Linnankatu. Both drivers reported that the heavy rain made visibility difficult, and they were driving below the speed limit due to the adverse weather conditions.

According to eyewitness accounts, Mr. Mäki's Volvo approached the intersection with a yellow traffic light, but he failed to stop at the red light that followed. The Audi, which had a green light, was unable to avoid colliding with the Volvo as it entered the intersection.

The impact caused both vehicles to spin out of control and come to rest on the northwest corner of the intersection. Mr. Mäki and his passenger, Ms. Liisa Lappalainen (38 years old), sustained minor injuries and were transported to Ylivieska Hospital for treatment. Ms. Koskela and her passenger, Mr. Marko Hämäläinen (40 years old), did not report any injuries.

The Volvo suffered significant front-end damage, with the bumper and grille crushed against the radiator. The Audi's front driver's side fender was also damaged, with a visible scrape along its length.

Traffic was diverted around the scene for approximately two hours while emergency services attended to the incident. The vehicles were towed away by Ylivieska Towing Services, and the intersection was cleared of debris.

The investigation into this incident is ongoing, with a focus on determining whether Mr. Mäki's failure to stop at the red light contributed to the accident. Both drivers have been issued traffic violation notices for disregarding a traffic signal.

This report will be updated as more information becomes available.
