Location: Kouvola, Finland
Incident Number: TI-KOU-2025-03489

On the night of July 6th, 2025, a traffic incident occurred at the intersection of Mannerheimintie and Tuusulankatu in Kouvola. The incident involved two vehicles: a silver Volvo XC90 (license plate F-ABC 123) driven by Mr. Juhani Siltala, aged 45, and a black Audi Q7 (license plate O-DEF 456) driven by Ms. Liisa Koskela, aged 38.

At approximately 23:15, Mr. Siltala was traveling southbound on Mannerheimintie, while Ms. Koskela was heading east on Tuusulankatu. According to eyewitness accounts, both drivers were driving at a reasonable speed given the time of day but were unable to account for the sudden gusts of wind that had picked up during the night.

As Mr. Siltala approached the intersection, he reportedly lost control of his vehicle due to the strong winds, causing him to veer into the eastbound lane on Tuusulankatu. Ms. Koskela, who was unable to react in time, collided with the driver's side of Mr. Siltala's vehicle.

Upon arrival at the scene, emergency services found both vehicles severely damaged but with no immediate life-threatening injuries reported. Mr. Siltala and Ms. Koskela were transported to Kouvola Central Hospital for further evaluation and treatment.

The intersection of Mannerheimintie and Tuusulankatu was closed for approximately three hours while the scene was cleared, evidence was collected, and the vehicles were towed away. The road conditions were slippery due to the windy weather, which likely contributed to the incident.

Witness statements suggest that both drivers were wearing seatbelts at the time of the collision, and neither alcohol nor drug use is suspected. The investigation into the incident is ongoing, with a focus on determining the exact cause of the accident and any contributing factors.

This report will be updated as more information becomes available.
