Location: Laukaa, Finland
Incident Number: TIR-230326-001
Time of Incident: 19:37 (evening)
Weather Conditions: Thunderstorm

Upon arrival at the scene on Kauppakatu (Shopping Street), near the intersection with Mannerheimintie, in Laukaa, I found two vehicles involved in a collision. The incident occurred between a black 2018 Volvo XC60 (license plate F-XYZ 123) driven by Mr. Juhani Siltala (age 45, address: Kauppakatu 12, Laukaa) and a silver 2021 Toyota Corolla (license plate O-ABC 987) driven by Ms. Liisa Koskela (age 32, address: Mannerheimintie 45, Laukaa).

According to eyewitness accounts, Mr. Siltala was traveling southbound on Kauppakatu when he failed to stop at the red light at the intersection with Mannerheimintie due to poor visibility caused by the thunderstorm. Ms. Koskela, who had a green light, was proceeding eastbound on Mannerheimintie and collided with Mr. Siltala's vehicle as a result.

The impact caused significant damage to both vehicles. The Volvo sustained front-end damage, with the bumper and hood crumpled, while the Toyota had extensive rear-end damage, including a shattered taillight and a dented trunk.

Upon examination of the scene, it was evident that the rain and lightning had made the roads slippery and reduced visibility for drivers. The thunderstorm also caused power outages in the area, making traffic signals unreliable.

Several witnesses provided statements at the scene, corroborating the account of the collision. Mr. Siltala was issued a citation for failing to stop at a red light and driving without due care and attention. No injuries were reported as a result of the incident.

The vehicles were towed from the scene, and the road was cleared by 21:00. The incident is currently under investigation, with further action to be determined pending the completion of the investigation.
