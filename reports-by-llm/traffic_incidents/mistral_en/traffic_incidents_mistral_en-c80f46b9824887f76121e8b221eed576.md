Incident Summary:
A traffic incident involving two vehicles occurred last night at the intersection of Hämeenkatu and Pirkankatu in Tampere. The incident involved a Toyota Corolla (license plate F-XYZ 123) driven by Mr. Jukka Lappalainen, aged 45, and a Volkswagen Golf (license plate O-ABC 987) driven by Ms. Liisa Mäki, aged 32.

According to eyewitness accounts, the incident occurred during wet and slippery conditions. Mr. Lappalainen was traveling southbound on Hämeenkatu while Ms. Mäki was turning left from Pirkankatu onto Hämeenkatu. Witnesses reported that Mr. Lappalainen failed to stop at the red light, colliding with Ms. Mäki's vehicle as she entered the intersection.

Timeline of Events:
1. 23:45 - Mr. Lappalainen approaches the intersection on Hämeenkatu, traveling southbound at an estimated speed of 60 km/h.
2. 23:45 - Ms. Mäki begins her left turn from Pirkankatu onto Hämeenkatu, with a green light for both directions.
3. 23:45 - Mr. Lappalainen disregards the red light and collides with Ms. Mäki's vehicle in the intersection.

Upon arrival at the scene, emergency services found both vehicles severely damaged. Mr. Lappalainen and his passenger, Mrs. Sari Lappalainen (aged 42), were uninjured but shaken up. Ms. Mäki and her passenger, Mr. Juhani Koskela (aged 30), sustained minor injuries and were transported to Tampere University Hospital for treatment.

The wet and slippery road conditions likely contributed to the incident by reducing visibility and traction for both drivers. The Toyota Corolla sustained significant front-end damage, while the Volkswagen Golf had extensive damage to its passenger side.

Both drivers were issued traffic violation notices for disregarding a red light and failing to yield at an intersection, respectively. The incident is currently under investigation by Tampere Police Department's Traffic Unit.
