 Title: Traffic Incident Report
Date: August 25, 2023
Location: Pieksämäki, Finland
Incident Number: PI-23-14678

On the morning of August 25, 2023, at approximately 08:30 hours, a four-vehicle collision occurred on Kauppakatu (Shopping Street) near the intersection with Linnankatu (Castle Street), in the heart of Pieksämäki.

The following vehicles were involved in the incident:
1. Vehicle 1 - A silver Toyota Corolla, license plate F-ABC 123, driven by Mr. Jari Mäkelä (45) and carrying his wife, Mrs. Sanna Mäkelä (42).
2. Vehicle 2 - A black Volkswagen Golf, license plate O-DEF 456, driven by Ms. Liisa Koskela (38), with her son, Elias Koskela (10) as a passenger.
3. Vehicle 3 - A red Ford Focus, license plate G-HJK 789, driven by Mr. Markku Saari (52).
4. Vehicle 4 - A blue Opel Astra, license plate P-LNM 345, driven by Ms. Anna Lehto (30).

According to eyewitness accounts, the incident began when Mr. Mäkelä's Toyota Corolla, traveling south on Kauppakatu, lost traction due to icy road conditions and slid into the northbound lane, colliding with Ms. Koskela's Volkswagen Golf. The impact caused both vehicles to spin out of control, blocking the northbound lanes.

In an attempt to avoid the collision, Mr. Saari's Ford Focus swerved onto the sidewalk, striking a street lamp before coming to a halt. Meanwhile, Ms. Lehto's Opel Astra, unable to stop in time due to the initial collision, rear-ended Mr. Saari's vehicle.

Emergency services arrived at the scene promptly and assessed all parties involved for injuries. Mr. Mäkelä and his wife sustained minor cuts and bruises, while Ms. Koskela and her son were unharmed. Mr. Saari was transported to Pieksämäki Hospital with a suspected concussion, and Ms. Lehto declined medical attention at the scene.

The vehicles involved in the collision sustained significant damage. Mr. Mäkelä's Toyota Corolla had front-end damage, while Ms. Koskela's Volkswagen Golf suffered damage to both the front and rear ends. Mr. Saari's Ford Focus was severely damaged, with the passenger side being crushed against a street lamp. The Opel Astra, which rear-ended the Ford Focus, had minor damage to its front bumper.

The icy road conditions were determined to have played a significant role in this incident. As such, the Pieksämäki Police Department reminds drivers to exercise caution when driving on icy roads and to maintain a safe following distance from other vehicles.

This report is preliminary and subject to further investigation by the Pieksämäki Traffic Investigation Unit. Further updates will be provided as information becomes available.
