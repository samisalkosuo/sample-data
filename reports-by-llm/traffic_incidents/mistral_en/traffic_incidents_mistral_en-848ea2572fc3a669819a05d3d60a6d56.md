 Title: Traffic Incident Report
Date: 15th of January, 2025
Location: Huittinen, Finland
Incident Number: HUIT-2025-0003

On the evening of January 15th, 2025, a traffic incident occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Linnankatu in the heart of Huittinen. The incident involved two vehicles: a silver Volvo XC90 (license plate F-XYZ 123) driven by Mr. Jukka Saarinen, aged 45, and a black Mercedes E-Class (license plate O-ABC 456) driven by Ms. Liisa Mäki, aged 38.

According to eyewitness accounts, the incident occurred around 7:15 PM local time. Both vehicles were traveling along Kauppakatu when a sudden gust of wind caused Mr. Saarinen's Volvo to lose control, veering into the opposite lane and colliding with Ms. Mäki's Mercedes.

The impact was significant, causing both vehicles to spin out of control before coming to a halt on the intersection. Witnesses immediately called emergency services, reporting the incident and providing their locations for rapid response.

Upon arrival, officers found Mr. Saarinen and his passenger, Mrs. Sari Saarinen (aged 42), unharmed but shaken. Ms. Mäki and her passenger, Mr. Juhani Koskela (aged 50), were extracted from their vehicle by the fire department due to the severe damage sustained in the collision. Both passengers were transported to Huittinen Central Hospital for precautionary checks.

The intersection was closed for approximately two hours while the scene was secured, evidence collected, and the vehicles towed away. The road conditions, exacerbated by strong gusts of wind, were deemed a contributing factor in the incident.

This report will be forwarded to the relevant authorities for further investigation. It is recommended that increased caution be exercised when driving during periods of high winds, especially at intersections and on roads with heavy traffic.
