Incident Description:

The incident occurred at the intersection of Korpikatu (Street of the Forest) and Rautatiekatu (Railway Street), near the address 123456 Kuusamo. The intersection is a four-way stop, with traffic lights for pedestrians.

Witness statements indicate that a white Volvo V90 station wagon (license plate FIN-ABC123) driven by Mr. Juhani Mäki (age 45, resident of Kuusamo) was approaching the intersection from Korpikatu. Simultaneously, a black Mercedes E-Class sedan (FIN-DEF456) driven by Ms. Sanna Koskela (age 32, resident of Kuusamo) was traveling southbound on Rautatiekatu.

According to witnesses, Mr. Mäki failed to stop at the designated stop line and proceeded into the intersection, where he collided with the Mercedes driven by Ms. Koskela. The impact caused both vehicles to spin out of control, resulting in a chain reaction involving three additional vehicles:

1. A blue Toyota Corolla (FIN-GHI789) driven by Mr. Marko Lappalainen (age 28, resident of Kuusamo), who was attempting to turn left from Korpikatu onto Rautatiekatu and collided with the spinning Mercedes.
2. A red Ford Focus (FIN-JKL012) driven by Ms. Liisa Nurmi (age 56, resident of Kuusamo), who was traveling southbound on Rautatiekatu and could not avoid the spinning vehicles, resulting in a rear-end collision with the Toyota Corolla.
3. A green Volkswagen Golf (FIN-MNO321) driven by Mr. Eero Saarinen (age 68, resident of Kuusamo), who was also traveling southbound on Rautatiekatu and swerved to avoid the collision but ended up colliding with a street sign and a parked vehicle.

All drivers and passengers involved in the incident were uninjured, but all vehicles sustained significant damage. The Volvo V90 had front-end damage, the Mercedes E-Class had front and rear-end damage, the Toyota Corolla had front and side damage, the Ford Focus had rear-end damage, and the Volkswagen Golf had front-end and side damage.

The incident caused significant traffic congestion in the area for approximately one hour while emergency services attended to the scene and cleared the debris. The intersection was closed during this time, with detours put in place for motorists.

This report is based on witness statements, physical evidence at the scene, and the observations of the responding officer. Further investigation may be required to determine the exact cause of the incident and any contributing factors.
