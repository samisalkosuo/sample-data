Incident Number: KAV-250208-001

On the evening of February 8th, 2025, a traffic incident occurred at the intersection of Mäntyharju Road (State Road 6) and Pihlajavesi Road (County Road 34), Kaavi. The incident involved two vehicles: a silver Toyota Corolla (license plate FIN-ABC123) driven by Mr. Jukka Saarinen, aged 35, and a black Volkswagen Golf (license plate FIN-DEF456) driven by Ms. Liisa Mäki, aged 42.

According to eyewitness accounts, the incident occurred around 18:30 local time. Both drivers were traveling along Mäntyharju Road approaching the intersection from opposite directions. The weather conditions at the time were windy with gusts, reducing visibility and creating challenging driving conditions.

Mr. Saarinen, who was driving the Toyota Corolla, reported that he had difficulty maintaining control of his vehicle due to the strong winds. As he approached the intersection, a sudden gust pushed his car towards the oncoming lane, causing him to lose control and collide with Ms. Mäki's Volkswagen Golf.

Ms. Mäki, who was also affected by the windy conditions, attempted to swerve to avoid the collision but was unable to do so in time. The front ends of both vehicles sustained significant damage as a result of the impact.

Emergency services arrived at the scene within 10 minutes and provided assistance to all parties involved. Mr. Saarinen and Ms. Mäki, along with their respective passengers (Ms. Anna Saarinen, aged 6, and Mr. Marko Mäki, aged 9), were transported to Kaavi Hospital for precautionary checks. No life-threatening injuries were reported.

The road was closed for approximately two hours while the scene was cleared and an investigation was conducted. The incident serves as a reminder of the importance of driving with caution, especially during adverse weather conditions.

This report is preliminary and subject to further investigation by the Kaavi Police Department's Traffic Unit.
