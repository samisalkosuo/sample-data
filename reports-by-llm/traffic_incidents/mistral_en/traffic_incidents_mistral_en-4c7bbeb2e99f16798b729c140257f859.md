Location: Siikajoki, Finland
Incident Number: SIK-241228-001

On the day of December 28th, 2024, at approximately 15:37 hours, a traffic incident occurred on Kauppakatu (Shopping Street) near the intersection with Linnankatu (Castle Street), Siikajoki. The incident involved two vehicles and was preceded by adverse weather conditions that significantly impacted the scene.

Vehicle 1: A silver 2023 Volvo XC90, license plate FIN-ABC 123, driven by Mr. Juhani Mäki (45 years old) with his wife, Mrs. Sari Mäki (42 years old), as a passenger. The vehicle was traveling southbound on Kauppakatu when the incident occurred.

Vehicle 2: A black 2021 Toyota Corolla, license plate FIN-DEF 456, driven by Ms. Liisa Koskela (38 years old) with her son, Mr. Eetu Koskela (9 years old), as a passenger. The vehicle was turning left from Linnankatu onto Kauppakatu when the incident occurred.

Witness statements indicate that both vehicles were traveling at or near the speed limit before the incident. As Ms. Koskela approached the intersection, she reportedly failed to notice the oncoming Volvo due to heavy rain and reduced visibility caused by a nearby thunderstorm. The Volvo was unable to stop in time and collided with the Toyota Corolla on the driver's side.

Upon arrival, emergency services found both vehicles partially blocking the intersection. The Toyota Corolla sustained significant damage to its front-left fender, door, and wheel, while the Volvo XC90 had minor damage to its front bumper and grille.

Mr. Mäki and his wife were uninjured in the incident but were visibly shaken. Ms. Koskela and her son were transported to Siikajoki Central Hospital for precautionary checks, reporting minor injuries.

The intersection was closed for approximately two hours while emergency services attended to the scene and traffic was diverted through alternate routes. The road conditions were slippery due to rain, and visibility was reduced by heavy downpours and lightning.

This incident is currently under investigation by the Siikajoki Police Department's Traffic Unit. Preliminary findings suggest that the primary cause of the accident was poor visibility caused by adverse weather conditions, with Ms. Koskela's failure to yield at the intersection being a contributing factor.

Investigators will continue to gather evidence and interview witnesses to determine the exact sequence of events leading up to the incident. Further updates will be provided as the investigation progresses.
