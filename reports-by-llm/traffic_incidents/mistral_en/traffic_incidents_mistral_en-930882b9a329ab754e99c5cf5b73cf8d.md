 Title: Traffic Incident Report
Date: 28.04.2025
Location: Lemland, Finland
Incident Number: LEM-250428-001

On the night of April 28th, 2025, at approximately 23:37 hours, a three-vehicle collision occurred on Vuorimiehenkuja (Warrior's Road), near the intersection with Kylpylänkatu (Bathhouse Street). The incident involved vehicles registered in Finland, Sweden, and Norway.

The following is a detailed account of the events leading up to the accident:

1. Vehicle 1 (V1): A 2023 Volvo XC90 (license plate FIN-ABC 123) driven by Mr. Juhani Mäki, aged 45, was traveling southbound on Vuorimiehenkuja at an estimated speed of 60 km/h.

2. Vehicle 2 (V2): A 2024 Toyota RAV4 Hybrid (license plate SWE-DEF 456) driven by Ms. Elsa Eriksson, aged 38, was approaching the intersection from Kylpylänkatu, intending to turn left onto Vuorimiehenkuja.

3. Vehicle 3 (V3): A 2022 Mercedes-Benz GLC (license plate NOR-GHI 789) driven by Mr. Ole Petterson, aged 52, was also traveling southbound on Vuorimiehenkuja, following closely behind V1.

As Ms. Eriksson began her left turn, she failed to notice the approaching vehicles due to poor visibility caused by light rain. Consequently, she entered the path of V1, causing Mr. Mäki to apply his brakes abruptly. However, due to the wet road conditions, V1 was unable to stop in time and collided with the rear end of V2.

Upon impact, V2 was forced into the northbound lane, where it was struck by V3, which could not avoid the collision due to insufficient braking distance on the wet road.

Immediately following the accident, witnesses at a nearby café (Kylpylän Kahvila) dialed emergency services to report the incident. The first responders arrived within 7 minutes and provided immediate medical attention to those involved in the collision.

No fatalities were reported; however, all three drivers sustained minor injuries and were transported to the nearest hospital for further evaluation and treatment. The vehicles involved suffered significant damage, with V2 being declared a total loss at the scene.

The incident is currently under investigation by the Lemland Police Department's traffic unit. Preliminary findings suggest that the primary cause of the accident was poor visibility due to light rain, combined with an inattentive driver (Ms. Eriksson) failing to yield the right-of-way at a controlled intersection.

This report will be updated as further information becomes available.
