On the evening of June 18, 2025, at approximately 7:34 PM local time, a multi-vehicle collision occurred on Vuoksenkatu, near the intersection with Keskuskatu. The incident involved three vehicles and resulted in minor injuries to several individuals.

The following is a detailed account of the events leading up to and including the incident:

1. At approximately 7:28 PM, a silver Toyota Corolla (license plate F-ABC 123) driven by Mr. Juhani Siltala (age 45, resident of Keskuskatu 21) was traveling southbound on Vuoksenkatu. The weather conditions were wet and slippery, making the road surface slick.

2. Approximately 30 seconds later, a red Volkswagen Golf (license plate F-DEF 456) driven by Ms. Liisa Mäki (age 38, resident of Vuoksenkatu 75) was traveling northbound on the same street. Ms. Mäki was reportedly driving at an excessive speed for the conditions, which contributed to the subsequent collision.

3. As Mr. Siltala approached the intersection with Keskuskatu, he slowed down due to the wet road conditions and reduced visibility. However, Ms. Mäki failed to notice the stopped traffic ahead and collided with the rear of Mr. Siltala's vehicle.

4. The impact caused Mr. Siltala's Corolla to spin out of control and collide with a parked Mercedes-Benz E-Class (license plate F-GHI 789) on the east side of Vuoksenkatu, owned by Mr. Markku Korpela (age 52, resident of Keskuskatu 45). The Mercedes sustained significant front-end damage as a result of the collision.

5. After the initial impact, Ms. Mäki's Volkswagen continued northbound and collided with a concrete barrier on the west side of Vuoksenkatu, causing extensive damage to the driver's side of her vehicle.

6. Emergency services arrived at the scene within minutes and assessed the injuries sustained by those involved in the collision. Mr. Siltala complained of neck pain, while Ms. Mäki reported dizziness and a headache. Both were transported to Imatra Central Hospital for further evaluation and treatment. No other passengers were present in any of the vehicles.

7. Witnesses at the scene reported that the road conditions had been slippery due to rainfall earlier in the day, and visibility was reduced by the onset of twilight. They also noted that Ms. Mäki appeared to be driving erratically before the collision occurred.

8. The incident caused significant traffic disruptions in the area for approximately two hours while emergency services attended to the scene and police conducted an initial investigation. The vehicles involved were towed away, and the road was cleared by 9:30 PM.

This report is preliminary in nature and subject to further investigation by the Imatra Police Department's Traffic Investigation Unit. Relevant parties will be contacted for follow-up interviews as necessary.
