 Title: Traffic Incident Report
Date: 08.05.2025
Location: Vaala, Finland
Incident Number: VA-2025-0167

On the day of May 8th, 2025, at approximately 14:37 hours, a traffic incident occurred on Kauppakatu (Shopping Street), near the intersection with Mannerheimintie (Mannerheim Avenue) in Vaala. The incident involved two vehicles: a silver Toyota Corolla (license plate FIN-ABC 123) driven by Mr. Juhani Sorsa, aged 45, and a black Volkswagen Golf (license plate FIN-DEF 456) driven by Ms. Liisa Mäki, aged 38.

According to eyewitness accounts, both vehicles were traveling in the same direction on Kauppakatu when the incident occurred. Mr. Sorsa, who was driving the Toyota Corolla, reportedly lost control of his vehicle due to the light rain that had started falling around 14:00 hours. The wet road conditions may have contributed to the loss of traction on Mr. Sorsa's vehicle, causing it to swerve into the adjacent lane and collide with Ms. Mäki's Volkswagen Golf.

The impact caused both vehicles to spin out of control, blocking the entire lane of traffic. The Toyota Corolla sustained significant damage to its front end, while the Volkswagen Golf suffered damage to its passenger side. Both drivers and their respective passengers—Ms. Sorsa's husband, Mr. Eero Sorsa, aged 42, and Ms. Mäki's daughter, Miss Aino Mäki, aged 10—were uninjured but shaken by the incident.

Emergency services arrived at the scene within minutes of the initial call. The police closed off the affected lane to ensure the safety of both the vehicles and the responding personnel. The traffic was diverted through side streets while the incident was being investigated and cleared.

The road conditions were assessed as slippery due to the light rain that had fallen earlier in the day, which may have contributed to the loss of control by Mr. Sorsa's vehicle. The incident serves as a reminder for drivers to exercise caution during inclement weather and to maintain proper control of their vehicles at all times.

This report is based on eyewitness accounts, physical evidence at the scene, and interviews with the involved parties. Further investigation will be conducted to determine the exact cause of the incident and any potential contributing factors.
