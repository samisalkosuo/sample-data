 Traffic Incident Report

Date: October 13, 2023
Location: Pieksämäki, Finland
Incident Number: PI-231013-001

On the day of October 13, 2023, at approximately 14:37 hours, a multi-vehicle collision occurred on Kauppakatu (Shopping Street) near the intersection with Linnankatu (Castle Street), in the heart of Pieksämäki. The incident involved eleven vehicles, resulting in extensive traffic disruptions and minor injuries to several individuals.

The following is a detailed account of the events leading up to the collision:

Witness statements suggest that the incident began when a white Volvo XC60 (license plate F-XYZ 123) driven by Mr. Jari Mäki (age 45, resident of Kauppakatu 28) approached the intersection from Kauppakatu with a green light. Simultaneously, a black Mercedes E-Class (license plate O-ABC 987) driven by Ms. Liisa Koskela (age 32, resident of Linnankatu 45) was traveling southbound on Linnankatu, also with a green light.

As Mr. Mäki proceeded through the intersection, he failed to notice that the icy road conditions had caused Ms. Koskela's Mercedes to lose traction and slide sideways into his path. In an attempt to avoid a collision, Mr. Mäki swerved sharply to the right, but unfortunately, his Volvo collided with the rear passenger side of the Mercedes.

The impact caused both vehicles to spin out of control, with the Mercedes coming to rest partially on the sidewalk and the Volvo blocking the southbound lanes of Kauppakatu. The force of the collision also set off a chain reaction involving nine additional vehicles, including a bus (license plate B-DEF 456) and several other passenger cars.

Emergency services arrived at the scene within minutes, with police officers, firefighters, and paramedics working together to assess the situation and provide aid to those in need. The injured parties were transported to Pieksämäki Hospital for treatment, with no life-threatening injuries reported.

The road was closed for several hours while the scene was cleared and an investigation was conducted. The icy conditions on the roads played a significant role in the incident, as many drivers reported difficulty maintaining control of their vehicles throughout the day.

As part of the ongoing investigation, all involved parties will be interviewed, and witness statements will be collected. The vehicles involved in the collision have been impounded for further examination and analysis.

This report is preliminary in nature and subject to change as the investigation continues. Further updates will be provided as information becomes available.
