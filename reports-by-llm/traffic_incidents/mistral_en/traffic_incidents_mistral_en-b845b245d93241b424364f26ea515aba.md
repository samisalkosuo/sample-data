 Traffic Incident Report

Date: 10.04.2023
Location: Kruunupyy, Finland
Incident Number: TI-230410-KRU-001
Time of Occurrence: 23:37 (Night)
Weather Conditions: Thunderstorm

Upon arrival at the scene, I found a three-vehicle collision on Mannerheimintie (State Highway 5), near the intersection with Kauppakatu (Main Street). The incident involved a silver Toyota Corolla (license plate FIN-ABC123), a black Volkswagen Golf (FIN-DEF456), and a red Ford Focus (FIN-GHI789).

Witness statements suggest that the incident began when the driver of the Toyota Corolla, Mr. Jari MÃ¤ki (age 35, address: Kauppakatu 2A, Kruunupyy), was traveling southbound on Mannerheimintie at high speed in heavy rain and lightning conditions. As he approached the intersection with Kauppakatu, the driver lost control of his vehicle due to the slippery road surface and hydroplaning. The Corolla veered across the northbound lanes, colliding with the Volkswagen Golf (driven by Ms. Liisa Koskela, age 42, address: Mannerheimintie 10B, Kruunupyy) head-on.

The impact of the collision caused both vehicles to spin out of control and come to rest in the northbound lanes. The red Ford Focus (driven by Mr. Marko Saarinen, age 28, address: Mannerheimintie 7C, Kruunupyy), traveling northbound at a moderate speed, was unable to avoid the collision and struck the rear of the Volkswagen Golf.

Upon my arrival, all parties involved were out of their vehicles and appeared shaken but uninjured. Emergency medical services (EMS) were called as a precaution, and they arrived on scene at 23:45 to assess the parties' conditions. No serious injuries were reported, and EMS cleared the scene at 00:15.

The road was closed for approximately two hours while the vehicles were removed and the scene was investigated. The slippery road surface due to the thunderstorm played a significant role in the incident, as did the high speed of the Toyota Corolla. All parties involved received traffic violation citations for driving too fast for conditions.

This report will be forwarded to the Kruunupyy Police Department for further investigation and potential charges.
