 Title: Traffic Incident Report
Date: 03.04.2023
Location: Muhos, Finland
Incident Number: 23-15678

On the night of April 3rd, 2023, at approximately 23:15 local time, a traffic incident occurred on Kauppakatu (Shopping Street) near the intersection with Linnankatu (Castle Street), in Muhos. The incident involved two vehicles: a silver Volvo V60 with license plate F-ABC 123 and a black Audi Q5 with license plate XYZ 456.

Witness accounts suggest that the Volvo, driven by Mr. Jukka Saarinen (age 38, resident of Kauppakatu 21), was traveling southbound on Kauppakatu at a speed estimated to be slightly above the posted 50 km/h limit. Simultaneously, the Audi, driven by Ms. Liisa Mäki (age 42, resident of Linnankatu 37), was turning left from Linnankatu onto Kauppakatu.

As Mr. Saarinen approached the intersection, he failed to notice the Audi making the turn due to poor visibility caused by light rain and insufficient street lighting in the area. The Volvo collided with the driver's side of the Audi, causing both vehicles to spin out of control before coming to a halt on the southbound lane of Kauppakatu.

Upon arrival at the scene, emergency services found no serious injuries reported among the four occupants involved. Mr. Saarinen and his passenger, Ms. Anna Hietala (age 35), sustained minor cuts and bruises. The driver of the Audi, Ms. Mäki, and her passenger, Mr. Marko Koskela (age 40), were unharmed but shaken by the incident.

The Volvo suffered significant front-end damage, with the bumper and grille being crushed upon impact. The Audi's driver's side door was dented, and the airbags deployed. Both vehicles were towed away from the scene for further inspection and repairs.

The incident caused a temporary roadblock on Kauppakatu, which was cleared by 01:30 local time after the vehicles were removed. The Muhos Police Department would like to remind drivers to exercise caution while driving in adverse weather conditions and to always prioritize safety over speed.

This report is preliminary and subject to further investigation by the Muhos Police Department's Traffic Investigation Unit.
