 Title: Traffic Incident Report - 08.05.2024, Rautavaara, Finland

On the day of May 8th, 2024, at approximately 14:37 hours, an unfortunate multi-vehicle collision occurred on Kauppakatu (Shopping Street), a major thoroughfare in the heart of Rautavaara, Finland. The incident involved eight vehicles, resulting in minor to moderate injuries for several individuals and significant traffic disruptions.

The following is a detailed account of the events leading up to the collision:

14:30 hours - A white Volvo V60 with Finnish license plate FAB 123X, driven by Mr. Juhani Mäki (58), was traveling southbound on Kauppakatu at a moderate speed. In the same direction, a black Mercedes-Benz C-Class with license plate SOL 456Y, driven by Ms. Liisa Koskela (37), was following closely behind.

14:32 hours - As both vehicles approached the intersection with Linnankatu (Castle Street), a red Toyota Corolla with license plate TUK 789V, driven by Mr. Eero Saarinen (25), failed to stop at the red light and entered Kauppakatu from Linnankatu.

14:33 hours - In an attempt to avoid a collision, Ms. Koskela swerved her Mercedes-Benz to the left, but unfortunately, she collided with the Toyota Corolla on the driver's side. The impact caused the Corolla to spin out of control and move diagonally across Kauppakatu.

14:34 hours - As a result of the initial collision, Mr. Mäki was unable to avoid the spinning Corolla and collided with its passenger side. The force of the impact caused both vehicles to come to a halt in the middle of the road.

14:35 hours - A chain reaction ensued as several other vehicles attempted to avoid the collision, resulting in additional collisions involving four more vehicles: a blue Ford Focus (license plate LUK 234Z), a grey Volkswagen Golf (license plate KAI 678R), a black Opel Astra (license plate TAP 901S), and a silver Peugeot 308 (license plate HEL 345T).

The scene was chaotic, with debris scattered across the road, vehicles damaged, and several individuals in distress. Emergency services were promptly notified, and they arrived on the scene within minutes.

Upon assessment, it was determined that Mr. Mäki and Ms. Koskela sustained minor injuries, while Mr. Saarinen was transported to the local hospital with moderate injuries. The other drivers involved in the incident were unharmed but shaken up by the experience.

The overcast weather conditions contributed to reduced visibility, making it more challenging for drivers to react appropriately to the situation. Road conditions were wet and slippery due to recent rainfall, further complicating the incident.

The traffic disruption caused by the collision resulted in significant delays for commuters and local businesses. Kauppakatu was closed for several hours while emergency services worked to clear the scene and investigate the cause of the accident.

This report is based on eyewitness accounts, police investigation, and interviews with the drivers involved. The incident remains under investigation, and further updates will be provided as more information becomes available.
