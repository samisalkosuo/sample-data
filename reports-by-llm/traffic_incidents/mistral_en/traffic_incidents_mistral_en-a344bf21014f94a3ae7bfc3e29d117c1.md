 Title: Traffic Incident Report
Date: 27th January 2024
Location: Miehikkälä, Finland
Incident Number: TI-240127-001

On the day of 27th January 2024, at approximately 15:30 hours, a traffic incident occurred on Kauppakatu (Shopping Street) near the intersection with Tuomarinkatu (Judge's Street), in Miehikkälä. The incident involved two vehicles: a silver Volvo XC60 (license plate F-XYZ 123) driven by Mr. Juhani Särkijärvi, aged 45, and a black Audi Q7 (license plate O-ABC 987) driven by Ms. Liisa Mäkelä, aged 38.

According to eyewitness accounts, the thunderstorm that had been brewing throughout the day intensified just before the incident, causing reduced visibility and slippery road conditions. Mr. Särkijärvi was traveling southbound on Kauppakatu at a speed estimated between 60-70 km/h when he lost control of his vehicle due to the adverse weather conditions. The Volvo veered off the road onto the wet grass verge, skidded, and collided with a streetlight pole.

Ms. Mäkelä, who was traveling northbound on Kauppakatu at approximately the same speed as Mr. Särkijärvi, did not have time to react before her vehicle struck the rear of the Volvo that had already left the road. The impact caused both vehicles to spin out of control, with the Audi coming to a halt against a parked Mercedes-Benz C-Class (license plate L-DEF 456) on the opposite side of the street.

Emergency services arrived at the scene within minutes and assessed that neither Mr. Särkijärvi nor Ms. Mäkelä, nor their respective passengers, sustained life-threatening injuries. Both drivers were transported to Miehikkälä Hospital for further examination and treatment. The passengers in both vehicles, identified as Mr. Särkijärvi's son, aged 12, and Ms. Mäkelä's daughter, aged 8, were unharmed but shaken by the incident.

The road was closed for approximately two hours while the scene was secured, evidence was collected, and the vehicles were towed away. The damaged streetlight pole was replaced, and the road was treated with salt to improve traction.

Witnesses at the scene reported that both drivers appeared to be paying attention and driving cautiously given the weather conditions. However, it is believed that the combination of heavy rain, reduced visibility, and slippery roads contributed significantly to the incident.

This report will be forwarded to the Traffic Accident Investigation Unit for further analysis and determination of any potential contributing factors or violations of traffic laws.
