 Title: Traffic Incident Report
Date: June 20, 2025
Location: Isojoki, Finland
Incident Number: TI-2025-06-1234

On the day of June 20, 2025, at approximately 14:37 hours, a traffic incident occurred on Mäkelänkatu (Mäkelä Street), a major thoroughfare in Isojoki. The incident involved two vehicles: a silver Toyota Corolla with license plate F-ABC 123 and a black Volkswagen Golf with license plate F-DEF 456.

Witness accounts suggest that the Toyota, driven by Mr. Juhani Mäkelä (age 35, resident of Mäkelänkatu 23), was traveling southbound on Mäkelänkatu at a speed estimated to be slightly above the posted 50 km/h limit. Simultaneously, the Volkswagen, driven by Ms. Liisa Kauppinen (age 42, resident of Kauppinakuja 17), was turning left from Kauppinakuja onto Mäkelänkatu, intending to head northbound.

The overcast weather conditions and poor visibility due to rain showers may have contributed to the incident. As Ms. Kauppinen began her turn, she failed to notice the approaching Toyota due to the reduced visibility. The Toyota was unable to stop in time and collided with the Volkswagen on the driver's side.

The impact caused significant damage to both vehicles. The front-left fender of the Toyota was crumpled, while the driver's side door of the Volkswagen sustained severe damage and had to be pried open by emergency responders to extract Ms. Kauppinen. Both drivers and passengers reported minor injuries and were transported to Isojoki Hospital for further evaluation and treatment.

The traffic on Mäkelänkatu was diverted during the incident, causing temporary congestion in the area. The scene was secured by local law enforcement, and an investigation is ongoing to determine the exact cause of the accident and any potential contributing factors.

This report will be updated as more information becomes available.
