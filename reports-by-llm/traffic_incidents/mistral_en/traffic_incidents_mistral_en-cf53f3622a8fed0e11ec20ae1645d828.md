 **Traffic Incident Report**

Date: 18.01.2025
Location: Pyhäjoki, Finland
Incident Number: PYH-250118-001

On the morning of January 18th, 2025, at approximately 07:45, a traffic incident occurred on Kauppakatu (Shopping Street) near the intersection with Linnankatu (Castle Street), in Pyhäjoki. The incident involved two vehicles: a silver Volvo XC90 with license plate FIN-ABC123 and a black Mercedes E-Class with license plate FIN-DEF456.

Witness accounts suggest that the incident began when the driver of the Volvo, Mr. Jari Mäki (age 38, resident of Kauppakatu 27), was approaching the intersection from Kauppakatu while the driver of the Mercedes, Ms. Liisa Koskela (age 45, resident of Linnankatu 19), was turning left onto Kauppakatu from Linnankatu.

As Ms. Koskela began her turn, a sudden thunderstorm hit the area, reducing visibility and causing slippery road conditions due to rain mixing with snow. The Volvo, traveling at an estimated speed of 60 km/h in a 50 km/h zone, was unable to stop in time and collided with the Mercedes, which had already started its turn.

The impact caused both vehicles to spin out of control, with the Volvo coming to rest against a streetlight pole on the north side of Kauppakatu, and the Mercedes coming to rest diagonally across the intersection.

Emergency services arrived at the scene within 5 minutes of the initial call. Both drivers were uninjured but shaken up by the incident. The passengers in both vehicles, Mr. Mäki's wife and Ms. Koskela's son, also reported no injuries.

The road was closed for approximately one hour while the vehicles were removed and the scene was cleared. The police are investigating the incident further, focusing on the role of the weather conditions in the accident.

This report is preliminary and subject to change as the investigation continues.
