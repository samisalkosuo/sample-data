 Title: Traffic Incident Report

Date: December 13, 2023
Location: Lapinlahti, Finland
Incident Number: TI-231213-001

On the morning of December 13, 2023, at approximately 8:45 AM local time, a traffic incident occurred on Kauppakatu (Shopping Street) near the intersection with Mannerheimintie (Mannerheim Avenue), Lapinlahti. The incident involved two vehicles: a silver Toyota Corolla (license plate F-ABC 123) driven by Mr. Jukka Sariola, aged 45, and a red Volkswagen Golf (license plate X-DEF 456) driven by Ms. Liisa Mäki, aged 38.

According to eyewitness accounts, both vehicles were traveling in the same direction on Kauppakatu when Mr. Sariola's Toyota Corolla, approaching the intersection with Mannerheimintie, failed to stop at the red light. The vehicle collided with Ms. Mäki's Volkswagen Golf, which was already moving through the intersection.

The clear and sunny weather conditions provided good visibility for both drivers, but the icy road surface may have contributed to Mr. Sariola's inability to stop his vehicle in time. The Toyota Corolla sustained significant front-end damage, while the Volkswagen Golf suffered damage to its passenger side.

Emergency services arrived at the scene promptly and assessed the condition of all parties involved. Both drivers and passengers reported no serious injuries, but were taken to Lapinlahti Hospital for further examination as a precautionary measure.

The incident caused minor traffic disruptions in the area, with police directing traffic around the accident scene until the vehicles could be towed away. The road was cleared by 9:30 AM, and normal traffic resumed.

This report is based on eyewitness accounts, the physical evidence at the scene, and statements from both drivers involved. The incident remains under investigation to determine the exact cause of the collision and any potential charges that may be applicable.
