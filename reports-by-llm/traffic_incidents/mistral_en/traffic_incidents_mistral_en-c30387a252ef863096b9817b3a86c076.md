Time of Day: Morning

At approximately 8:45 AM on December 1st, 2023, a multi-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Mannerheimintie in Inkoo. The incident involved eleven vehicles, resulting in minor injuries to several individuals and significant traffic disruptions.

Upon arrival at the scene, officers found a chaotic and hazardous environment due to the windy conditions that had been blowing throughout the morning. Witnesses reported that the wind had been gusting strongly for some time before the accident, causing visibility issues for drivers on both roads leading to the intersection.

The following is a timeline of events based on witness statements and evidence collected at the scene:

1. A white Volvo XC90 (license plate F-XYZ 123) driven by Mr. Juhani Lehto (58, resident of Kauppakatu 45) was approaching the intersection from Kauppakatu with a green light.

2. Simultaneously, a black Mercedes E-Class (license plate O-ABC 987) driven by Ms. Sanna Koskinen (34, resident of Mannerheimintie 67) was approaching the intersection from Mannerheimintie with a red light. Despite the traffic signal, Ms. Koskinen attempted to make a left turn onto Kauppakatu due to poor visibility caused by the wind.

3. A red Toyota Corolla (license plate P-DEF 456) driven by Mr. Markku Saarinen (28, resident of Mannerheimintie 79) was traveling behind Ms. Koskinen and failed to stop in time, colliding with the rear of her Mercedes.

4. The impact caused Ms. Koskinen's Mercedes to spin out of control, striking a parked blue Ford Focus (license plate L-GHI 890) on the side of the road.

5. The force of the collision propelled the Mercedes into the path of an oncoming green Mazda CX-5 (license plate M-JKL 789) driven by Ms. Liisa Niemi (42, resident of Kauppakatu 34). Ms. Niemi was unable to avoid the collision and struck the Mercedes, causing it to roll onto its side.

6. The chain reaction continued as the Mazda CX-5 collided with a black Audi Q7 (license plate N-MNO 123) driven by Mr. Eero M채ki (45, resident of Kauppakatu 56), who was unable to stop in time due to the chaotic scene unfolding before him.

7. The Audi Q7 then struck a silver Volkswagen Golf (license plate L-PQR 987) driven by Ms. Anna H채m채l채inen (23, resident of Mannerheimintie 88), who was also unable to avoid the collision due to the windy conditions and the rapidly developing incident.

8. The final vehicle involved in the collision was a grey Subaru Outback (license plate K-STU 456) driven by Mr. Jari Virtanen (37, resident of Mannerheimintie 90), who swerved to avoid the accident but ended up colliding with the rear of the Audi Q7.

Emergency services arrived on the scene within minutes and assessed the injuries sustained by those involved in the collision. Minor injuries were reported among several individuals, including Ms. Sanna Koskinen, Mr. Markku Saarinen, and Ms. Liisa Niemi. All injured parties were transported to Inkoo Hospital for further evaluation and treatment.

The intersection of Kauppakatu and Mannerheimintie was closed for several hours while the scene was cleared and evidence was collected. Traffic disruptions continued throughout the morning as police officers directed traffic around the accident site.

Investigations into the cause of the collision are ongoing, with a focus on the impact of windy conditions on driver visibility and decision-making. Recommendations for improved signage and traffic control measures at the intersection will be considered in light of this incident.

This report is preliminary and subject to further investigation and analysis. Updates will be provided as more information becomes available.
