 Title: Traffic Incident Report
Date: October 20, 2023
Location: Pello, Finland
Incident Number: TI-231020-001

On the evening of October 20, 2023, at approximately 19:37 hours, a traffic incident occurred on Kauppakatu (Shopping Street) near the intersection with Linnankatu (Castle Street), in the heart of Pello. The incident involved two vehicles: a silver Volkswagen Golf TSI bearing Finnish license plate FAB-123M, driven by Mr. Jukka Saarinen, and a black Toyota Corolla Hybrid with license plate LKO-456N, operated by Ms. Liisa Mäki.

According to eyewitness accounts, both vehicles were traveling southbound on Kauppakatu when the incident occurred. Mr. Saarinen, 38, a local resident of Kauppakatu 21, was reportedly driving at an estimated speed of 60 km/h in a 50 km/h zone. Ms. Mäki, 42, residing at Linnankatu 37, was observed maintaining the speed limit.

As Mr. Saarinen approached the intersection with Linnankatu, he failed to stop at the red traffic light and collided with Ms. Mäki's vehicle, which had a green light. The impact occurred near the crosswalk, causing both vehicles to spin out of control before coming to a halt.

The incident took place under dry but cold conditions, with temperatures hovering around -3°C. The road surface was icy in some areas due to the recent drop in temperature, which may have contributed to the loss of control by Mr. Saarinen's vehicle.

Upon arrival at the scene, emergency services found no injuries among the drivers or passengers involved. Both vehicles sustained significant damage: Mr. Saarinen's Volkswagen had a crumpled front end and a shattered windshield, while Ms. Mäki's Toyota Corolla displayed a damaged rear bumper and a broken taillight.

Witnesses at the scene provided statements to the police, corroborating the sequence of events leading up to the collision. The incident is currently under investigation by the Pello Police Department, with charges potentially being filed against Mr. Saarinen for reckless driving and disregard for traffic regulations.

This report has been compiled based on eyewitness accounts, physical evidence at the scene, and interviews with the drivers involved. Further investigation will be conducted to determine the exact cause of the incident and any contributing factors.
