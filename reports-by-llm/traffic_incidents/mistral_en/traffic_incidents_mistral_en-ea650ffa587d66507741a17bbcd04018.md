On the evening of June 26, 2025, at approximately 19:37 hours, a multi-vehicle collision occurred on Vuorimiehenkuja (Warrior's Road) near the intersection with Keminmaantie (Kemi Highway). The incident involved seven vehicles and resulted in minor injuries to several individuals.

The following is a detailed account of the events leading up to the accident:

19:35 hours - A white Volvo XC90, driven by Mr. Jukka Lehtonen (42 years old), was traveling southbound on Vuorimiehenkuja with his wife and two children as passengers. The vehicle's license plate number is F-ABC 123.

19:36 hours - A black Mercedes E-Class, driven by Ms. Liisa Mäki (35 years old), was traveling northbound on the same road at a high speed. Her license plate number is F-DEF 456.

19:37 hours - As Ms. Mäki approached the intersection with Keminmaantie, she failed to stop at the red light and collided with a stationary delivery truck, a Ford Transit, driven by Mr. Marko Saarinen (28 years old). The impact caused the Mercedes to spin out of control and into the path of the oncoming Volvo XC90.

19:37 hours - In an attempt to avoid the collision, Mr. Lehtonen swerved his vehicle to the right but was unable to prevent a collision with the Mercedes. The front left bumper of the Volvo collided with the driver's side door of the Mercedes, causing both vehicles to spin and come to a stop in the middle of the road.

19:38 hours - A red Toyota Corolla, driven by Mr. Petri Koskela (52 years old), was traveling southbound behind the Volvo XC90. Upon seeing the collision, he applied his brakes but was unable to avoid hitting the rear of the Volvo. The impact caused the Toyota to spin and collide with a parked car, a silver Volkswagen Golf, driven by Ms. Sanna Nurmi (30 years old).

19:39 hours - A black BMW X5, driven by Mr. Eero Hämäläinen (48 years old), was traveling northbound behind the Mercedes and was unable to stop in time to avoid the collision. The front of the BMW collided with the rear of the Mercedes, causing both vehicles to sustain significant damage.

19:40 hours - A green Peugeot 3008, driven by Ms. Anna-Liisa Kivinen (25 years old), was traveling northbound behind the BMW and was unable to stop in time to avoid the collision. The front of the Peugeot collided with the rear of the BMW, causing both vehicles to sustain additional damage.

Emergency services arrived at the scene within minutes and assessed the injuries of those involved. Mr. Lehtonen, Ms. Mäki, and Mr. Saarinen were transported to the local hospital for treatment of minor injuries. The other drivers and passengers did not require medical attention.

The road was closed for several hours while the scene was cleared and an investigation was conducted. The snowy conditions and poor visibility were contributing factors in the accident. The cause of the initial collision remains under investigation, with a focus on Ms. Mäki's failure to stop at the red light.

This report is based on eyewitness accounts, police reports, and physical evidence collected at the scene. Further updates will be provided as the investigation continues.
