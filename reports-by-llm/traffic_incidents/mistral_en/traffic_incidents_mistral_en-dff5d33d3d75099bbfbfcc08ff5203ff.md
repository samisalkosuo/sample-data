 Title: Traffic Incident Report - 09.11.2024, Laitila, Finland

On the evening of November 9th, 2024, at approximately 21:37 hours, an unfortunate multi-vehicle collision occurred on Vuorimiehenkuja (Warrior's Road), a major arterial road in Laitila, Finland. The incident involved eleven vehicles, resulting in significant traffic disruptions and injuries.

The following is a detailed account of the events leading up to the accident:

1. Initial Incident (21:37): A 35-year-old driver identified as Mr. Jukka Saarinen was traveling southbound on Vuorimiehenkuja in a 2024 Volvo XC90 (license plate F-ABC 123) at an estimated speed of 80 km/h. Due to the heavy thunderstorm, visibility was significantly reduced, and the road surface became slippery.

2. First Collision (21:37): As Mr. Saarinen approached the intersection with Kylpykartanonkatu (Bathhouse Street), he failed to notice a red traffic light due to the poor weather conditions. His vehicle collided with a 2024 Toyota Corolla (license plate F-DEF 456) driven by a 28-year-old woman, Ms. Liisa Mäki, who was making a left turn onto Kylpykartanonkatu.

3. Chain Reaction (21:37 - 21:38): The impact of the initial collision caused a chain reaction, with nine additional vehicles involved in subsequent collisions. Among them were a 2024 Audi Q5 (license plate F-GHI 789) driven by a 42-year-old man, Mr. Markku Nurmi, and a 2024 Mercedes-Benz C-Class (license plate F-JKL 901) driven by a 38-year-old woman, Ms. Sanna Koskinen.

4. Witness Accounts: Several witnesses reported that the thunderstorm had made it difficult to see the accident unfold, with many drivers slowing down or pulling over due to the poor visibility. A local resident, Mr. Eero Lappalainen (65), who lives near the intersection, provided a statement describing the chaotic scene and the immediate aftermath of the collision.

Upon arrival, emergency services found several injured individuals, with Ms. Liisa Mäki and Mr. Markku Nurmi sustaining the most severe injuries. Both were transported to the Laitila Hospital for treatment. The other drivers and passengers involved in the incident reported minor injuries or no injuries at all.

The road was closed for approximately four hours while emergency services attended to the scene, and traffic was diverted through alternative routes. The Finnish Weather Service issued a severe weather warning for the region, advising motorists to exercise caution due to the heavy thunderstorm and slippery road conditions.

This incident serves as a reminder of the importance of adhering to traffic regulations, especially during adverse weather conditions. The investigation into the cause of the accident is ongoing, with a focus on determining whether Mr. Saarinen's speed or visibility played a role in the collision.
