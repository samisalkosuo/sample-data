 Title: Traffic Incident Report
Date: August 8, 2023
Location: Huittinen, Finland
Incident Number: HUIT-230808-001

On the day of August 8, 2023, at approximately 14:37 hours, a multiple vehicle collision occurred on Kauppakatu (Shopping Street) near the intersection with Linnankatu (Castle Street), in the heart of Huittinen. The incident involved six vehicles, resulting in minor injuries to several individuals and causing significant traffic disruptions.

The following is a detailed account of the events leading up to the collision:

1. Initial Incident (14:37)
   At the time of the incident, it was a wet and slippery day in Huittinen. The weather conditions contributed to poor visibility and slick road surfaces, making driving challenging for motorists.

   Mr. Jari Mäki, 45, driving a 2018 Volvo XC60 (license plate F-ABC 123) was approaching the intersection from Kauppakatu with a green light. Simultaneously, Ms. Liisa Koskela, 37, in a 2020 Toyota Corolla (license plate O-DEF 456), was traveling southbound on Linnankatu, also with a green light.

   As Mr. Mäki proceeded through the intersection, his vehicle hydroplaned due to the wet road conditions, causing him to lose control and veer into Ms. Koskela's path.

2. Chain Reaction Collision (14:37 - 14:38)
   In an attempt to avoid a collision, Ms. Koskela swerved sharply to the right, but unfortunately, her vehicle collided with Mr. Mäki's. The impact caused both vehicles to spin out of control and into the path of oncoming traffic.

   A third vehicle, a 2015 Ford Focus (license plate G-HIJ 789), driven by Mr. Marko Saari, 34, was unable to stop in time and collided with Ms. Koskela's Corolla. The force of the impact caused both vehicles to spin again, blocking the southbound lanes on Linnankatu.

   Meanwhile, a fourth vehicle, a 2019 Mercedes-Benz C-Class (license plate J-KLM 901), driven by Ms. Anna Lehto, 48, was approaching the intersection from Kauppakatu when she witnessed the collision unfold. In an attempt to avoid the accident, she swerved sharply to the left and collided with a fifth vehicle, a 2021 Honda Civic (license plate L-NOP 321), driven by Mr. Petri Virtanen, 56. Both vehicles sustained significant damage and came to rest on the sidewalk.

   A sixth vehicle, a 2017 Hyundai Tucson (license plate M-PQR 567), driven by Ms. Sari Nurmi, 32, was also approaching the intersection from Kauppakatu when she saw the collision and came to a stop.

3. Aftermath and Witnesses
   Emergency services were promptly dispatched to the scene, and traffic in the area was diverted to minimize further incidents. The injured parties were treated on-site by paramedics before being transported to the local hospital for further evaluation and treatment.

   Several witnesses provided statements at the scene, including Mr. Matti Lappalainen, 50, who was waiting at a bus stop nearby when he observed the entire incident unfold. He described the wet and slippery road conditions as a significant contributing factor to the collision.

In conclusion, this multiple vehicle collision on August 8, 2023, in Huittinen, Finland, resulted from poor weather conditions and the loss of control by one driver. The incident caused minor injuries to several individuals and significant traffic disruptions. An investigation into the cause of the initial accident is ongoing, with a focus on the role of the wet and slippery road surfaces in the collision.
