 Title: Traffic Incident Report - 11.11.2024, Pietarsaari, Finland

On the evening of November 11th, 2024, at approximately 19:37 hours, a three-vehicle collision occurred on Kauppakatu (Shopping Street), near the intersection with Torikatu (Market Street) in Pietarsaari, Finland.

The incident involved the following vehicles:

1. A silver Volvo XC60 (license plate F-ABC 123) driven by Mr. Juhani Mäki (45 years old), traveling southbound on Kauppakatu.
2. A red Toyota Corolla (license plate O-DEF 456) driven by Ms. Liisa Koskela (32 years old), also heading southbound on Kauppakatu, immediately behind Mr. Mäki's vehicle.
3. A blue Ford Fiesta (license plate G-HIJ 789) driven by Mr. Eero Saarinen (28 years old), turning left from Torikatu onto northbound Kauppakatu.

According to eyewitness accounts, Mr. Mäki's Volvo was traveling at an excessive speed, estimated between 60-70 km/h in a 50 km/h zone. As he approached the intersection with Torikatu, Ms. Koskela, who was following him, attempted to apply her brakes but was unable to stop in time due to Mr. Mäki's sudden acceleration.

Simultaneously, Mr. Saarinen, who had a green light for his left turn, began his maneuver and collided with the rear of Ms. Koskela's Corolla. The impact caused her vehicle to spin out of control and into the path of Mr. Mäki's Volvo, which was unable to avoid a collision.

The incident occurred under clear and sunny skies, providing good visibility for all parties involved. However, the lack of streetlights in this particular section of Kauppakatu may have contributed to the difficulty Ms. Koskela experienced in stopping her vehicle in time.

Upon arrival at the scene, emergency services found Mr. Mäki and Ms. Koskela uninjured but shaken. Mr. Saarinen sustained minor injuries due to the airbag deployment in his Ford Fiesta. All three parties were transported to Pietarsaari Central Hospital for further examination.

The Volvo XC60 suffered significant front-end damage, with the bumper and grille severely deformed. The Toyota Corolla's rear end was crushed, and the Ford Fiesta sustained damage to its front left quarter panel and hood.

This incident is currently under investigation by the Pietarsaari Police Department. Charges are pending against Mr. Mäki for reckless driving and excessive speed.
