 Title: Traffic Incident Report
Date: 05.06.2024
Location: Luoto, Finland
Incident Number: LUO-240605-001

On the evening of June 5th, 2024, at approximately 19:37 hours, a traffic incident occurred on Kauppakatu (Shopping Street), Luoto. The incident involved two vehicles: a silver Volvo XC90 with license plate FIN-ABC 123 and a black Audi Q5 with license plate FIN-DEF 456.

Witness accounts suggest that the Volvo, driven by Mr. Juhani Mäki (age 42, resident of Kauppakatu 21), was traveling southbound on Kauppakatu at a speed estimated to be slightly above the posted 50 km/h limit. Simultaneously, the Audi, driven by Ms. Sanna Koskela (age 35, resident of Kauppakatu 47), was turning left from Linnankatu (City Street) onto Kauppakatu, also traveling southbound.

The weather conditions at the time were wet and slippery, with a light drizzle falling throughout the evening. The road surfaces were slick, reducing traction for both vehicles. As Ms. Koskela began her turn, her Audi lost grip on the wet asphalt, causing it to slide sideways into the path of Mr. Mäki's oncoming Volvo.

The front left bumper of the Volvo collided with the rear right fender of the Audi, causing both vehicles to spin out of control. The Volvo came to a stop against a streetlight pole on the east side of Kauppakatu, while the Audi came to rest diagonally across the intersection of Linnankatu and Kauppakatu.

Emergency services were notified immediately and arrived at the scene within minutes. Both drivers and passengers reported no serious injuries, though Ms. Koskela sustained minor cuts from broken glass. The vehicles sustained significant damage to their front ends and will require extensive repairs.

The incident caused a temporary blockage of traffic in the area, with police directing detours until the scene was cleared at approximately 21:00 hours. The road surfaces were treated with salt and sand to improve traction and prevent further incidents due to the wet conditions.

This report is based on witness statements, physical evidence at the scene, and interviews with both drivers involved in the incident. The investigation is ongoing to determine any contributing factors, such as potential impairment or distraction of either driver.
