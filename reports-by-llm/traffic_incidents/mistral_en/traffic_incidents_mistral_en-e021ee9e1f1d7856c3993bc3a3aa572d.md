 Title: Traffic Incident Report - 31.01.2024, Kristiinankaupunki, Finland

On January 31st, 2024, at approximately 15:37 hours, a multi-vehicle collision occurred on Vuoksenkatu, near the intersection with Kauppakatu, in Kristiinankaupunki, Finland. The incident involved three vehicles and resulted in minor injuries to several individuals.

The following is a detailed account of the events leading up to the accident:

1. Witness Accounts: A group of pedestrians waiting at the bus stop on the northeast corner of Vuoksenkatu and Kauppakatu reported observing a silver Volvo XC60 (license plate F-ABC 123) traveling southbound on Vuoksenkatu, approaching the intersection. The vehicle was described as driving at an excessive speed for the weather conditions, which included mixed snow and rain.

2. Initial Collision: As the Volvo approached the intersection, it failed to stop at the red traffic light and collided with a stationary Toyota Corolla (license plate F-DEF 456) parked on the southwest corner of the intersection, owned by Mr. Jari M채ki (resident of Kauppakatu 23). The impact caused the Corolla to spin out of control and collide with a nearby lamppost.

3. Secondary Collision: In an attempt to avoid the initial collision, a black Audi Q5 (license plate F-GHI 789) traveling eastbound on Kauppakatu swerved to the right, crossing into the westbound lane and colliding with the spinning Corolla. The Audi sustained significant front-end damage as a result of the collision.

Upon arrival at the scene, emergency services found Mr. M채ki and his passenger, Ms. Liisa Lappalainen (resident of Kauppakatu 25), in the Corolla. Both individuals were conscious but complained of minor injuries. The driver of the Volvo, identified as Mr. Marko Koskinen (resident of Vuoksenkatu 45), was found uninjured but visibly shaken. The driver of the Audi, Ms. Anna S채rkij채rvi (resident of Kauppakatu 17), also reported no injuries.

The road conditions at the time of the incident were slippery due to the mixed snow and rain, which likely contributed to the excessive speed of the Volvo and the subsequent collision. The vehicles involved in the accident were towed away for further inspection and assessment of damages.

This report is being submitted for the official record and will be forwarded to the appropriate authorities for further investigation.
