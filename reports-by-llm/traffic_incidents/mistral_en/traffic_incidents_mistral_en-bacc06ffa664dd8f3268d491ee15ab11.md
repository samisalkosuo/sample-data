 Title: Traffic Incident Report
Date: 08.12.2024
Location: Somero, Finland
Incident Number: 24-1208-003

On the evening of December 8th, 2024, a four-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Tietotie, in the heart of Somero. The incident took place around 6:30 PM local time, during the transition from day to evening, under dry but cold weather conditions.

The following is a detailed account of the events leading up to the collision:

1. Vehicle 1 (2024 Toyota Corolla, license plate F-ABC 123) was traveling westbound on Kauppakatu, driven by Mr. Jari Mäki (age 35, resident of Tietotie 2A).

2. Vehicle 2 (2024 Volkswagen Golf, license plate F-DEF 456), driven by Ms. Liisa Koskela (age 42, resident of Kauppakatu 12B), was approaching the intersection from the same direction as Vehicle 1, intending to turn left onto Tietotie.

3. Vehicle 3 (2024 Hyundai i30, license plate F-GHI 789) was traveling eastbound on Kauppakatu, driven by Mr. Marko Saarinen (age 28, resident of Kauppakatu 15C).

4. Vehicle 4 (2024 Ford Focus, license plate F-JKL 0MN) was traveling southbound on Tietotie, driven by Ms. Anna Lehto (age 30, resident of Tietotie 7D), who intended to proceed straight through the intersection.

As Vehicle 2 turned left onto Tietotie, it collided with Vehicle 1, causing both vehicles to spin out of control and block the eastbound lanes on Kauppakatu. In the chaos that ensued, Vehicle 3 was unable to stop in time and crashed into the rear end of Vehicle 1. The impact from this collision caused Vehicle 2 to collide with Vehicle 4, which was unable to avoid the accident scene due to poor visibility.

Several witnesses reported that Mr. Mäki (Vehicle 1) had been driving at an excessive speed and failed to reduce his speed as he approached the intersection. Ms. Koskela (Vehicle 2) stated that she had activated her turn signal before turning left, but was unable to complete the maneuver safely due to the sudden collision.

Upon arrival, emergency services found all parties involved in the collision uninjured but shaken. The vehicles sustained significant damage: Vehicles 1 and 2 were deemed a total loss, while Vehicles 3 and 4 required extensive repairs.

The road was closed for approximately two hours to allow for the removal of debris and investigation of the scene. Traffic was diverted through alternative routes during this time.

This report is preliminary in nature and will be updated as further information becomes available. The incident remains under investigation by the Somero Police Department's traffic unit.
