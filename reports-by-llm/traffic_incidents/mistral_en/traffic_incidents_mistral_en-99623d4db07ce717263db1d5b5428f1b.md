 Title: Traffic Incident Report
Date: August 22, 2024
Location: Heinävesi, Finland
Incident Number: HV-240822-001

On the evening of August 22, 2024, at approximately 19:37 hours, a four-vehicle collision occurred on Kauppakatu (Shopping Street) near the intersection with Linnankatu (Castle Street), in the heart of Heinävesi.

The following vehicles were involved:
1. Vehicle 1 - A silver Toyota Corolla (license plate F-ABC 123) driven by Mr. Jari Mäki, aged 45, and carrying two passengers, Ms. Liisa Niemi, aged 42, and their son, Elias Mäki, aged 8.
2. Vehicle 2 - A black Volkswagen Golf (license plate O-DEF 456) driven by Ms. Anna Särkijärvi, aged 37, with no passengers.
3. Vehicle 3 - A red Ford Focus (license plate G-HIJ 789) driven by Mr. Marko Koskinen, aged 28, and carrying one passenger, Ms. Sanna Korpela, aged 25.
4. Vehicle 4 - A blue Opel Astra (license plate J-KLM 012) driven by Mr. Eero Penttilä, aged 52, with no passengers.

According to eyewitness accounts and the investigation conducted at the scene, the incident began when Mr. Mäki's Toyota Corolla, traveling south on Kauppakatu, hydroplaned due to mixed snow and rain conditions, causing it to lose control and veer into the northbound lane. Simultaneously, Ms. Särkijärvi's Volkswagen Golf was approaching from the opposite direction at a high speed. Unable to avoid the out-of-control Corolla, the Golf collided head-on with the Toyota.

The impact of this initial collision caused both vehicles to spin out of control and block the southbound lane. Meanwhile, Mr. Koskinen's Ford Focus, traveling behind the Toyota, was unable to stop in time and rear-ended the Corolla. The momentum from this collision propelled the Focus into the path of Mr. Penttilä's Opel Astra, which was forced to swerve off the road to avoid a collision.

Upon arrival, emergency services found all parties involved in the incident unharmed but shaken. Mr. Mäki and his passengers were treated for minor injuries at the scene, while Ms. Särkijärvi was transported to the local hospital for observation due to complaints of neck pain. No other injuries were reported.

The road was closed for approximately two hours while the vehicles were removed and the scene was investigated. The mixed snow and rain conditions, combined with the high speed of some of the vehicles involved, were determined to be contributing factors in the incident.

This report will be forwarded to the appropriate authorities for further investigation and potential charges.
