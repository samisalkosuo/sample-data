 **Traffic Incident Report**

Date: September 23, 2023
Location: Saarijärvi, Finland
Incident Number: SAARI-23092023-11V

On the evening of September 23, 2023, at approximately 19:45 local time, a multi-vehicle collision occurred on Kauppakatu (Shopping Street), near the intersection with Mannerheimintie (Mannerheim Avenue). The incident involved eleven vehicles, resulting in extensive traffic disruptions and injuries.

The following is a detailed account of the events leading up to the accident:

1. **Initial Incident (19:45)**
   At the time of the collision, Jukka Mäki (Driver A), operating a 2018 Volvo XC60 with license plate F-ABC 123, was traveling southbound on Kauppakatu. Simultaneously, Liisa Koskela (Driver B), driving a 2015 Toyota Corolla with license plate O-DEF 456, was heading northbound. Both drivers were reported to be within the speed limit and adhering to traffic regulations.

   As Driver A approached the intersection, he failed to notice that Driver B had slowed down due to a pedestrian (Witness 1) crossing the street. In an attempt to avoid a collision, Driver A swerved to the left, but unfortunately, his vehicle collided with the rear end of a stationary delivery truck (Vehicle C), owned by Kauppa Oy and parked on the northbound side of the road.

2. **Chain Reaction Collisions (19:45 - 19:50)**
   The impact caused Vehicle C to roll backward, striking a nearby lamp post before coming to a halt. The force of the collision also propelled Driver A's Volvo into the northbound lanes, where it collided with Driver B's Toyota Corolla.

   The subsequent impact sent both vehicles careening out of control. Driver B's Corolla veered off the road and struck a snowbank, while Driver A's Volvo continued northward, colliding with three additional vehicles (Vehicles D, E, and F) that were stopped at a red light on Mannerheimintie.

   The chain reaction did not end there. The force of the collision caused Vehicle F to be pushed into the intersection, where it struck another vehicle (Vehicle G) traveling eastbound on Kauppakatu. Meanwhile, Vehicle E was forced into a head-on collision with an oncoming vehicle (Vehicle H), driven by Martti Saarinen (Driver I).

3. **Aftermath and Injuries**
   The accident resulted in significant property damage to all involved vehicles and the delivery truck. Additionally, several injuries were reported among the drivers and passengers.

   - Driver A: Sustained minor injuries and was transported to Saarijärvi Hospital for treatment.
   - Driver B: Reported moderate injuries and was also transported to Saarijärvi Hospital.
   - Passenger in Vehicle C (Juha Miettinen): Sustained serious injuries and was transported to Oulu University Hospital for further care.
   - Driver I: Reported minor injuries but refused transportation to the hospital.
   - Several other passengers reported minor scrapes and bruises, but no additional hospitalization was required.

4. **Witness Statements**
   Witness 1, a pedestrian who was crossing Kauppakatu at the time of the collision, stated that Driver A appeared to be distracted before the accident occurred. Another witness (Witness 2), a resident living near the intersection, reported that the road conditions were slippery due to fresh snowfall.

5. **Road and Weather Conditions**
   The incident took place on a residential street in Saarijärvi, with Kauppakatu serving as the main thoroughfare. At the time of the collision, the weather was snowy, with visibility slightly reduced due to falling snowflakes. The road surface was slick and icy, contributing to the chain reaction collisions.

6. **Investigation and Next Steps**
   The Saarijärvi Police Department is currently investigating the incident, focusing on Driver A's potential distraction and the role of the snowy conditions in the accident. Further updates will be provided as the investigation progresses.
