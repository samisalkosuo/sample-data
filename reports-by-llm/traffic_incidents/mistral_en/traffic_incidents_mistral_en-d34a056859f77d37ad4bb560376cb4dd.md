 Title: Traffic Incident Report - 08.08.2024, Sievi, Finland

On the evening of August 8th, 2024, at approximately 19:37 local time, a multi-vehicle collision occurred on Kauppakatu (Shopping Street), near the intersection with Linnankatu (Castle Street) in the heart of Sievi municipality. The incident involved ten vehicles, resulting in minor injuries to several individuals and significant traffic disruption.

The following is a detailed account of the events leading up to the collision:

19:35 - A northbound Toyota Corolla (license plate F-ABC 123) driven by Mr. Juhani Mäki, aged 40, was approaching the intersection at Linnankatu with a green light. Simultaneously, a southbound Volkswagen Golf (license plate XYZ 987) driven by Ms. Sanna Koskela, aged 35, was turning left from Linnankatu onto Kauppakatu, also with a green light.

19:36 - As Mr. Mäki's Corolla approached the intersection, he failed to notice that traffic on Linnankatu had started to build up due to a red light further down the road. Ms. Koskela, who was unable to see oncoming traffic due to a blind spot created by a parked delivery truck, began her left turn without checking for approaching vehicles.

19:37 - The front of Mr. Mäki's Corolla collided with the driver's side of Ms. Koskela's Golf, causing both vehicles to spin out of control and come to a halt in the middle of the intersection. The impact caused a chain reaction involving eight additional vehicles, including a Volvo XC90 (license plate DEF 456), driven by Mr. Marko Saarinen, aged 28, who was unable to stop in time and rear-ended Ms. Koskela's Golf.

Witnesses at the scene reported that the weather conditions were dry but cold, with temperatures hovering around 10°C (50°F). The road surface was slick due to a recent rainfall earlier in the day, which had since frozen over. This contributed to the vehicles losing traction and sliding during the collision.

Emergency services arrived at the scene within minutes, with police officers, firefighters, and paramedics all responding to the incident. Mr. Mäki, Ms. Koskela, and Mr. Saarinen were treated for minor injuries at the scene before being transported to a nearby hospital for further evaluation.

The intersection was closed for several hours while the vehicles were removed and the scene was investigated by local police officers. The road reopened at approximately 23:00 local time, with traffic returning to normal levels by midnight.

This incident serves as a reminder to all drivers to exercise caution, especially during adverse weather conditions and in high-traffic areas. It is essential to always check for oncoming traffic and be aware of potential blind spots when making turns or changing lanes.

Investigation into the cause of the collision is ongoing, with charges potentially being filed against Mr. Mäki for failing to yield the right of way at an intersection. The investigation will also examine whether any contributing factors, such as road conditions or vehicle maintenance issues, played a role in the incident.
