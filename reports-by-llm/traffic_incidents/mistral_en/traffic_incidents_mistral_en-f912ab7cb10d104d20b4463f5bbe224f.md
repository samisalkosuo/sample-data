Location: Luhanka, Finland
Incident Number: LUH-230111-001

On the night of January 11th, 2023, at approximately 23:45 local time, a multi-vehicle collision occurred on Kauppakatu (Shopping Street) near the intersection with Mannerheimintie (Mannerheim Avenue), in the heart of Luhanka. The incident involved nine vehicles, resulting in injuries and significant traffic disruption.

The following is a detailed account of the events leading up to the accident:

1. Mr. Jukka Lehtonen, driving a 2018 Volvo XC60 (license plate F-XYZ 123), was traveling southbound on Kauppakatu at an estimated speed of 60 km/h. The road conditions were icy, making it difficult for drivers to maintain control of their vehicles.

2. Approaching the intersection with Mannerheimintie, Mr. Lehtonen failed to notice a red light due to the poor visibility and slippery roads. He proceeded into the intersection, colliding with a northbound 2017 Toyota Corolla (license plate F-ABC 456) driven by Ms. Liisa Mäki.

3. The impact of the initial collision caused a chain reaction, as several other vehicles were unable to stop in time. A southbound 2019 Ford Focus (license plate F-DEF 789), driven by Mr. Markku Koskela, rear-ended Mr. Lehtonen's Volvo.

4. The Ford Focus then careened into the path of a northbound 2020 Mercedes-Benz C-Class (license plate F-GHI 901), driven by Ms. Anna Särkijärvi, who was unable to avoid the collision.

5. The Mercedes-Benz subsequently struck a southbound 2016 Volkswagen Golf (license plate F-JKL 234) driven by Mr. Petri Niemi, causing it to spin out of control and collide with a northbound 2015 Honda Civic (license plate F-MNO 321), driven by Ms. Sanna Lappalainen.

6. The final vehicle involved in the incident was a southbound 2022 Hyundai Tucson (license plate F-PQR 456) driven by Mr. Eero Saarinen, who managed to swerve and avoid the initial collision but was unable to prevent his vehicle from hitting a stationary traffic light pole on the east side of the intersection.

Emergency services arrived at the scene within minutes, with police officers, firefighters, and paramedics all responding to the incident. The injured parties were treated on-site before being transported to nearby hospitals for further care. No fatalities were reported.

The road was closed for several hours while the accident investigation team examined the scene and cleared debris. Traffic was diverted through alternative routes, causing significant delays throughout the evening.

As of this report's writing, the cause of the initial collision is under investigation, with a focus on Mr. Lehtonen's failure to stop at the red light due to poor visibility and icy road conditions. The vehicles involved sustained varying degrees of damage, ranging from minor scrapes to extensive structural damage in some cases.

This incident serves as a reminder for all drivers to exercise caution when driving on icy roads, especially during nighttime hours. It is essential to maintain a safe following distance, reduce speed, and always be prepared for unexpected situations.
