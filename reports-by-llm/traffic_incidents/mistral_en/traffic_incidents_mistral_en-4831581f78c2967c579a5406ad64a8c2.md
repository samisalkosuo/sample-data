 Traffic Incident Report
Date: 18.09.2023
Location: Juuka, Finland
Incident Number: JUU-230918-001

On the morning of September 18th, 2023, at approximately 08:45, a traffic incident occurred on Kauppakatu (Shopping Street) near the intersection with Linnankatu (Castle Street), in the heart of Juuka. The incident involved two vehicles: a silver Volkswagen Golf TSI bearing Finnish license plate FAB-123M, driven by Mr. Juhani Mäki, and a black Toyota Corolla Hybrid with license plate HEL-456N, operated by Ms. Liisa Koskela.

According to eyewitness accounts, both vehicles were traveling southbound on Kauppakatu when the incident occurred. Mr. Mäki, 38, a local resident of Juuka, was reportedly driving at an estimated speed of 60 km/h in a 50 km/h zone. Ms. Koskela, 42, from Helsinki, was driving at the speed limit.

As Mr. Mäki approached the intersection with Linnankatu, he failed to stop at the red light and collided with Ms. Koskela's vehicle, which had the right of way. The impact caused both vehicles to spin out of control, blocking the southbound lanes of Kauppakatu.

The weather conditions at the time were overcast, with a temperature of 10°C and light rainfall. The wet road surface likely contributed to the incident by reducing visibility and traction for the drivers involved.

Upon arrival, emergency services found no injuries among the four occupants (Mr. Mäki, Ms. Koskela, and their respective passengers). However, both vehicles sustained significant damage: Mr. Mäki's Volkswagen had a crumpled front bumper and a shattered windshield, while Ms. Koskela's Toyota Corolla had a damaged front end and a compromised passenger side door.

The Juuka Police Department is currently investigating the incident, with a focus on determining whether Mr. Mäki was under the influence of alcohol or drugs at the time of the collision. Witnesses have been identified and interviewed, and their statements will be crucial in establishing the sequence of events leading up to the accident.

This report will be updated as more information becomes available.
