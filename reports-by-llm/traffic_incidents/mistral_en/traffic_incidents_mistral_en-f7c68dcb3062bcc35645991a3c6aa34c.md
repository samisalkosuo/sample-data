 Title: Traffic Incident Report - 26.10.2024, Sund, Finland

On the night of October 26th, 2024, at approximately 23:37 local time, a multi-vehicle collision occurred on Kauppakatu (Shopping Street), Sund, Finland. The incident involved three vehicles and resulted in minor injuries to several individuals.

The following is a detailed account of the events leading up to the accident:

1. Vehicle 1 (V1): A 2024 Toyota Corolla, license plate F-ABC 123, driven by Mr. Juhani Lehto (58), was traveling southbound on Kauppakatu at a speed estimated to be within the posted 50 km/h limit.

2. Vehicle 2 (V2): A 2022 Volvo XC60, license plate F-DEF 456, driven by Ms. Sanna Mäki (34), was parked on the eastern side of Kauppakatu, near the address Kauppakatu 12, waiting to pick up her child from a music lesson at the Sund Music School located across the street.

3. Vehicle 3 (V3): A 2023 Mercedes-Benz C-Class, license plate F-GHI 789, driven by Mr. Markku Saari (45), was traveling northbound on Kauppakatu at a speed estimated to be slightly above the posted limit due to poor visibility caused by heavy snowfall.

As V3 approached the intersection with Kauppakatu and Linnankatu (City Street), it lost traction on the snow-covered road, causing the vehicle to slide sideways into the path of oncoming traffic. In an attempt to avoid a collision, V1 swerved to the right but was unable to completely avoid impact. The front left bumper of V3 collided with the rear passenger side of V1, causing both vehicles to spin out of control.

In the chaos that ensued, V2, which had just begun to pull away from its parking spot, was struck by the spinning V1. The rear end of V2 was severely damaged as it came to rest against a snowbank on the western side of Kauppakatu.

Eyewitnesses reported that the incident occurred rapidly and that there were no signs of reckless driving or intoxication prior to the collision. Several passersby immediately stopped to assist the injured parties, while others called emergency services.

Upon arrival, medical personnel assessed the injuries sustained by those involved in the accident. Mr. Lehto complained of neck pain and was transported to Sund Hospital for further evaluation and treatment. Ms. Mäki and her child were unharmed but shaken by the incident. No other injuries were reported.

The road was closed for approximately two hours while the scene was cleared, evidence was collected, and statements from witnesses were taken. The vehicles involved in the collision were towed away for further inspection and assessment of damage.

This report is preliminary in nature and subject to ongoing investigation by the Sund Police Department's Traffic Investigation Unit. Further updates will be provided as more information becomes available.
