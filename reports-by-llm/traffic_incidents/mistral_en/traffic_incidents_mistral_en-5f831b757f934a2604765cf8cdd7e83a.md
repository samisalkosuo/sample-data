 Title: Traffic Incident Report
Date: October 10, 2024
Location: Lappeenranta, Finland
Incident Number: 24-39876

On the night of October 10, 2024, at approximately 23:15 local time, a traffic incident occurred on Vuokatinportti Street near the intersection with Kauppakatu. The incident involved two vehicles: a silver Toyota Corolla (license plate F-ABC 123) driven by Mr. Jukka Saarinen, aged 45, and a black Volkswagen Golf (license plate X-DEF 456) driven by Ms. Liisa Mäki, aged 38.

According to eyewitness accounts, both vehicles were traveling in the same direction on Vuokatinportti Street when heavy rain began to fall, significantly reducing visibility. Mr. Saarinen, who was driving the Toyota Corolla, lost control of his vehicle due to the slippery road conditions and hydroplaning. The Corolla veered off the road and collided with a street sign before skidding back onto the road and coming to a stop near the intersection.

Ms. Mäki, driving the Volkswagen Golf behind Mr. Saarinen, was unable to react in time to avoid the collision due to the poor visibility caused by the heavy rain. Her vehicle struck the rear of the Toyota Corolla, causing both vehicles to sustain significant damage. Ms. Mäki and her passenger, Mr. Marko Lappalainen, aged 42, were uninjured in the incident. However, Mr. Saarinen complained of neck pain and was transported to the Lappeenranta Central Hospital for further evaluation.

The incident caused a significant traffic disruption on Vuokatinportti Street, with emergency services arriving at the scene within 10 minutes. The road was closed for approximately two hours while the vehicles were towed away and the scene was cleared. The Lappeenranta Police Department is investigating the incident and will determine whether any charges are warranted based on the findings of the investigation.

Weather conditions at the time of the incident included heavy rain, reducing visibility and making road conditions slippery. The incident serves as a reminder to all drivers to exercise caution when driving in adverse weather conditions and to maintain a safe following distance from other vehicles.
