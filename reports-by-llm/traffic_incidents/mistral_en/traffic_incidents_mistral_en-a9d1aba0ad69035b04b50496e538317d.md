 Title: Traffic Incident Report
Date: August 21, 2023
Location: Mynämäki, Finland
Incident Number: TI-230821-001

On the night of August 21, 2023, at approximately 11:45 PM local time, a multi-vehicle collision occurred on Kauppakatu (Shopping Street) near the intersection with Linnankatu (Castle Street), in Mynämäki. The incident involved three vehicles and resulted in minor injuries to several individuals.

The first vehicle involved was a 2018 Volvo XC60 (license plate F-XYZ 123) driven by Mr. Juhani Kivinen, age 45, of Linnankatu 2A. Witness statements suggest that Mr. Kivinen was traveling southbound on Kauppakatu at a speed considered excessive for the wet and slippery conditions.

The second vehicle involved was a 2017 Toyota Corolla (license plate O-ABC 987) driven by Ms. Sanna Mäki, age 34, of Kauppakatu 3B. Ms. Mäki was traveling northbound on Kauppakatu and had just turned left onto Linnankatu when the collision occurred.

The third vehicle involved was a 2016 Ford Focus (license plate P-DEF 456) driven by Mr. Marko Saarinen, age 28, of Linnankatu 7A. Mr. Saarinen was traveling southbound on Kauppakatu and was unable to avoid the collision due to the excessive speed of Mr. Kivinen's Volvo.

According to eyewitness accounts, Mr. Kivinen lost control of his vehicle as he approached the intersection, likely due to the wet and slippery road conditions. The Volvo swerved into the northbound lane, striking Ms. Mäki's Corolla on the driver's side. The impact caused Ms. Mäki's car to spin out of control, where it was subsequently struck by Mr. Saarinen's Focus.

Upon arrival at the scene, emergency services found all three drivers and passengers uninjured but shaken. Mr. Kivini and Ms. Mäki were treated for minor cuts and bruises at the scene, while Mr. Saarinen declined medical attention. The vehicles sustained significant damage to their front ends and will require extensive repairs.

The incident is currently under investigation by local authorities. Charges are pending further review of evidence and witness statements. This report will be updated as more information becomes available.
