Incident Summary:
A three-vehicle collision occurred on Kauppakatu, near the intersection with Mannerheimintie, during the night of November 24th. The incident involved a Toyota Corolla (license plate F-XYZ123), a Volkswagen Golf (F-ABC456), and a Ford Focus (F-DEF789).

Upon arrival at the scene, it was observed that all three vehicles were damaged. The Toyota Corolla, driven by Mr. Juhani Lehto (35) of Kauppakatu 21, had collided head-on with the Volkswagen Golf, driven by Ms. Sanna Mäki (28) of Mannerheimintie 37. The Ford Focus, driven by Mr. Markku Koskela (42) of Kauppakatu 15, was found to have swerved onto the wrong side of the road and collided with the two other vehicles.

According to eyewitness accounts, the incident occurred when Mr. Koskela lost control of his Ford Focus due to wet and slippery road conditions. The vehicle veered into oncoming traffic, causing a chain reaction that resulted in the collision between all three vehicles.

The following individuals were present at the scene:
- Juhani Lehto (driver, Toyota Corolla)
- Sanna Mäki (driver, Volkswagen Golf)
- Markku Koskela (driver, Ford Focus)
- Eero Saari (passenger, Toyota Corolla)
- Anna-Liisa Hämäläinen (passenger, Volkswagen Golf)
- Petri Niemi (witness, Kauppakatu 13)
- Marja-Leena Lappalainen (witness, Mannerheimintie 42)

All parties involved in the incident were uninjured. Emergency services arrived promptly and assessed the scene before transporting the damaged vehicles to a nearby impound lot for further investigation.

The road was closed for approximately two hours while the incident was cleared, and traffic was diverted through alternative routes. The wet and slippery conditions were exacerbated by the recent rainfall, which contributed to the incident.

This report will be forwarded to the relevant authorities for further investigation and analysis.
