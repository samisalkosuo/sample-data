Location: Loppi, Finland
Incident Number: 23-LOP-004567

On the day of June 10th, 2023, at approximately 14:37 hours, a traffic incident occurred on Mäkelänkatu (Mäkelä Street), a major road in the municipality of Loppi. The incident involved two vehicles, resulting in minor injuries and significant traffic disruption.

Vehicle 1: A silver 2018 Volvo XC60 with license plate F-ABC 123 was traveling southbound on Mäkelänkatu when it lost control due to snowy road conditions. The driver, Mr. Juhani Kivinen (45), a resident of Mäkelänkatu 56, was unable to maintain traction and veered into the northbound lane.

Vehicle 2: A black 2017 Toyota Corolla with license plate O-DEF 456, driven by Ms. Sanna Saarinen (32), a resident of Kauppakatu 89, was traveling northbound on Mäkelänkatu at the time of the incident. Upon encountering the out-of-control Volvo, Ms. Saarinen was unable to avoid a collision and struck the driver's side of Mr. Kivinen's vehicle.

Witnesses reported that both drivers appeared to be wearing seatbelts and were conscious following the impact. Emergency services arrived at the scene within minutes and provided first aid to those involved before transporting them to the nearest hospital for further treatment.

The snowy weather conditions, combined with slippery roads, significantly contributed to the loss of control by Mr. Kivinen's vehicle. The incident caused a traffic jam that lasted approximately one hour as emergency services worked to clear the scene and re-establish normal traffic flow.

Upon further investigation, it was determined that neither driver showed signs of impairment or negligence. Both vehicles sustained significant damage in the collision, with the Volvo's front end being severely crumpled, and the Corolla's passenger side sustaining extensive damage as well.

This report will be forwarded to the appropriate authorities for further review and determination of any necessary follow-up actions.
