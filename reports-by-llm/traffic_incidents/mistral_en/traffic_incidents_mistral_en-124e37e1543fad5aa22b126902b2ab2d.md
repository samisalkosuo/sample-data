Incident Summary:
On the evening of December 11th, 2024, a traffic incident occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Linnankatu in Rääkkylä. The incident involved two vehicles: a silver Toyota Corolla (license plate F-ABC 123) driven by Mr. Jukka Saarinen, aged 45, and a black Volkswagen Golf (license plate O-DEF 456) driven by Ms. Liisa Mäki, aged 38.

According to eyewitness accounts, the incident began when Mr. Saarinen, approaching the intersection from Kauppakatu, failed to stop at the red light and collided with Ms. Mäki's vehicle, which was traveling along Linnankatu with a green light. The impact caused both vehicles to spin out of control before coming to a halt on the icy road surface.

Upon inspection of the vehicles, it was determined that both sustained significant damage. The Toyota Corolla's front-end was severely crumpled, while the Volkswagen Golf's passenger side suffered extensive damage.

Witness statements suggest that Mr. Saarinen may have been distracted or impaired at the time of the incident. He was found to be uninjured but visibly shaken. Ms. Mäki and her passenger, a 10-year-old child, were transported to Rääkkylä Hospital for precautionary checks. Both were released later that evening with no serious injuries reported.

The investigation into this incident is ongoing, with charges potentially being filed against Mr. Saarinen for failing to stop at a red light and causing an accident. The road conditions, while dry, were icy in certain areas due to the cold temperatures, which may have contributed to the severity of the collision.
