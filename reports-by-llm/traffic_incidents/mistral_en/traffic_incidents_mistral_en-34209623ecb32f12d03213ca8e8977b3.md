On the day of September 29, 2023, at approximately 14:37 hours, a multiple vehicle collision occurred on Mäkelänkatu (Mäkelä Street), near the intersection with Kylänkatu (Village Street). The incident involved three vehicles and resulted in minor injuries to several individuals.

The following is a detailed account of the events leading up to the accident:

14:36 hours - A white Volvo V70, driven by Mr. Jari Mäkelä (52 years old), was traveling southbound on Mäkelänkatu at an estimated speed of 60 km/h. The vehicle had a valid license plate number F-ABC 123.

Simultaneously, a black Opel Astra, driven by Ms. Liisa Kylä (45 years old), was approaching the same intersection from the east on Kylänkatu, also traveling at approximately 60 km/h. The vehicle's license plate number was F-DEF 456.

14:37 hours - As Mr. Mäkelä approached the intersection, he failed to notice a red light due to poor visibility caused by light rain. He proceeded into the intersection, colliding with Ms. Kylä's vehicle on the driver's side. The impact caused both vehicles to spin out of control and be pushed into a third vehicle, a silver Toyota Corolla, parked legally on the eastern curb of Mäkelänkatu. The Corolla was driven by Mr. Eero Kylä (23 years old), who was unharmed but visibly shaken by the incident.

Witnesses at the scene reported that the light rain had made it difficult to see, and some vehicles were driving with their headlights on low beam only, further reducing visibility. The road surface was wet but not slippery, and there were no obstructions or debris in the area.

Emergency services arrived at the scene within minutes, and all injured parties were transported to Rautjärvi Hospital for treatment. No fatalities were reported.

The incident is currently under investigation by the Rautjärvi Police Department's traffic unit. Preliminary findings suggest that Mr. Mäkelä may have been driving negligently due to poor visibility caused by the light rain, and charges are pending further investigation.

This report has been compiled based on eyewitness accounts, physical evidence at the scene, and interviews with the involved parties. Further updates will be provided as the investigation progresses.
