 Title: Traffic Incident Report - 04.05.2024, Uusikaupunki, Finland

Incident Summary:
On the evening of April 5th, 2024, at approximately 19:37 local time, a three-vehicle collision occurred on Kauppakatu (Shopping Street), near the intersection with Torikatu (Market Street) in Uusikaupunki, Finland. The incident involved vehicles with Finnish license plates as follows:

1. A 2023 Volvo XC60 (license plate F-ABC 123) driven by Mr. Juhani M채ki (45 years old), traveling southbound on Kauppakatu.
2. A 2022 Toyota Corolla (license plate O-DEF 456) driven by Ms. Sanna Koskela (32 years old), also traveling southbound on Kauppakatu, immediately behind Mr. M채ki's vehicle.
3. A 2021 Ford Fiesta (license plate G-HIJ 789) driven by Mr. Markku Saarinen (58 years old), turning left from Torikatu onto northbound Kauppakatu.

Witness Accounts:
Several witnesses reported that the overcast weather conditions had reduced visibility, and rain showers began just prior to the incident. The rainfall was moderate but steady, creating slippery road surfaces.

According to eyewitness statements, Mr. M채ki's Volvo XC60 was traveling at an estimated speed of 50 km/h (31 mph) when it hydroplaned due to the wet road conditions. The vehicle veered into the adjacent lane, colliding with Ms. Koskela's Toyota Corolla. Both vehicles sustained significant front-end damage and came to a stop.

Meanwhile, Mr. Saarinen's Ford Fiesta was attempting to turn left from Torikatu onto Kauppakatu when the initial collision occurred. Unable to avoid the accident, he collided with the rear of Ms. Koskela's Toyota Corolla. The Ford Fiesta sustained damage to its front bumper and grille, while the Corolla's rear end was severely impacted.

Immediate Response:
Uusikaupunki Police and emergency medical services (EMS) were dispatched to the scene. Upon arrival, officers secured the area, ensured the safety of those involved, and began investigating the incident. EMS assessed the injuries sustained by all parties and provided necessary medical attention on-site.

Investigation Findings:
Preliminary investigation suggests that the wet road conditions played a significant role in the accident. The rainfall had begun just prior to the incident, making the roads slippery and reducing visibility for drivers.

All parties involved were wearing seatbelts, which likely prevented more severe injuries. Mr. M채ki and Ms. Koskela reported minor injuries, while Mr. Saarinen was unharmed. The vehicles were towed from the scene for further examination and assessment of damage.

Conclusion:
This incident serves as a reminder to drivers to adjust their speed according to weather conditions and maintain a safe following distance during adverse driving conditions. The investigation is ongoing, with a focus on determining the exact cause of the initial hydroplaning event that initiated the chain reaction collision.
