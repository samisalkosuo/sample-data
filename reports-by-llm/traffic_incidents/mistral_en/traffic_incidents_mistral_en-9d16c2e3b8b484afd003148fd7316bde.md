Time of Occurrence: 08:37 AM (local time)
Weather Conditions: Light rain

Upon arrival at the scene, I found two vehicles involved in a collision on Kauppakatu (Shopping Street), near the intersection with Mannerheimintie. The incident occurred approximately 50 meters north of the address Kauppakatu 23, where both vehicles came to rest.

The first vehicle involved was a silver 2018 Volvo XC60 (license plate F-XYZ 123) driven by Mr. Juhani Siltala (age 45), traveling southbound on Kauppakatu. The second vehicle was a black 2017 Toyota Corolla (license plate O-ABC 987) driven by Ms. Liisa Koskela (age 32), who was turning left from Mannerheimintie onto Kauppakatu.

According to eyewitness accounts, Mr. Siltala was traveling at an estimated speed of 60 km/h in a 50 km/h zone due to the poor visibility caused by the light rain. Ms. Koskela began her left turn when she failed to yield right-of-way to oncoming traffic, resulting in the collision between the two vehicles.

Upon impact, both vehicles sustained significant damage. The Volvo XC60 suffered front-end damage, with the bumper and hood crumpled, while the Toyota Corolla's left side was severely damaged, including the door and wheel.

No passengers were present in either vehicle during the incident. Both drivers were uninjured but shaken up by the collision. Ms. Koskela was issued a traffic violation for failing to yield right-of-way.

The road was temporarily closed for approximately 45 minutes while emergency services attended to the scene and cleared debris. Traffic was diverted through side streets during this time.

This report will be forwarded to the appropriate authorities for further investigation and analysis.
