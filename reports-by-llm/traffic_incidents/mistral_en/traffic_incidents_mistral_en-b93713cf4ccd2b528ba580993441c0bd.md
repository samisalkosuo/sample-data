Upon arrival at the scene on Helsingintie (State Road 8), near the intersection with Kauppakatu, I found a multi-vehicle collision involving five vehicles. The incident occurred approximately 100 meters east of the intersection, near the address of Karvian Kauppakeskus (Karvia Shopping Center).

The following is a detailed account of the events leading up to the accident:

Vehicle 1 (Licence Plate: FIN-ABC 123), driven by Mr. Juhani Mäki (age 45, resident of Kauppakatu 2) was traveling eastbound on Helsingintie at a speed estimated to be around 60 km/h.

Simultaneously, Vehicle 2 (LIC-DEF 456), driven by Ms. Liisa Koskela (age 38, resident of Kauppakatu 10) was approaching the same intersection from the north on Kauppakatu, intending to turn right onto Helsingintie.

As Ms. Koskela began her turn, she failed to yield to Mr. Mäki's approaching vehicle, resulting in a collision between Vehicles 1 and 2. The impact caused both vehicles to spin out of control, with Vehicle 1 veering off the road and coming to rest against a tree, while Vehicle 2 continued eastbound for approximately 50 meters before colliding with Vehicle 3 (LIC-GHI 789), driven by Mr. Markku Saarinen (age 52, resident of Helsingintie 15).

Mr. Saarinen was unable to stop in time and crashed into the rear of Vehicle 2, causing it to spin around and collide with Vehicle 4 (LIC-JKL 901), driven by Ms. Sanna Nurmi (age 28, resident of Helsingintie 5). The impact caused Vehicle 2 to come to rest partially on the sidewalk, while Vehicles 3 and 4 came to a stop near the original point of collision.

As the chain reaction continued, Vehicle 5 (LIC-MNO 123), driven by Mr. Eero Lehto (age 60, resident of Helsingintie 20) was unable to avoid the accident scene and collided with the rear of Vehicle 4.

Upon my arrival at the scene, I found all parties involved outside their vehicles and uninjured, though shaken up by the incident. Witnesses at the scene, including Mr. and Mrs. Saku (residents of Kauppakatu 7), reported that they had seen Ms. Koskela fail to yield before the collision occurred.

The road conditions were dry and clear due to the sunny weather, with good visibility. The vehicles involved in the incident sustained varying degrees of damage:

- Vehicle 1 (Mitsubishi Outlander): Front-end damage, airbags deployed; license plate bent but readable.
- Vehicle 2 (Toyota Corolla): Extensive front- and rear-end damage, airbags deployed; license plate partially obscured by debris.
- Vehicle 3 (Volvo XC60): Minor rear-end damage; no airbag deployment.
- Vehicle 4 (Ford Focus): Moderate front- and rear-end damage; airbags deployed; license plate readable but scratched.
- Vehicle 5 (Hyundai i30): No visible damage; no airbag deployment.

The incident is currently under investigation, with a focus on determining the cause of the initial failure to yield by Ms. Koskela. All parties involved were cooperative and provided statements at the scene. No further injuries were reported as a result of the accident.
