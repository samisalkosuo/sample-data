 **Traffic Incident Report**

Date: September 17, 2023
Location: Ruokolahti, Finland
Incident Number: 23-45678

On the night of September 17, 2023, at approximately 23:30 hours, a traffic incident occurred on Mäkelänkatu, a major road in Ruokolahti. The incident involved two vehicles: a silver Volvo XC90 with license plate F-ABC 123 and a black Mercedes E-Class with license plate O-DEF 456.

Witness accounts suggest that the Volvo, driven by Mr. Juhani Mäkelä (age 42, resident of Mäkelänkatu 23), was traveling southbound on Mäkelänkatu at a speed estimated to be around 70 km/h in foggy conditions. The Mercedes, driven by Ms. Liisa Kauppinen (age 35, resident of Kauppinakuja 17), was approaching from the opposite direction.

Ms. Kauppinen reported that due to the heavy fog, she could not see oncoming traffic until it was too late. She attempted to swerve to the right but lost control of her vehicle, which skidded across the road and collided with Mr. Mäkelä's Volvo head-on.

Upon arrival at the scene, emergency services found both vehicles severely damaged. The front ends of both cars were crushed, and the airbags had deployed in each vehicle. Mr. Mäkelä and his passenger, Ms. Anna Särkijärvi (age 38), sustained minor injuries and were transported to Ruokolahti Hospital for treatment. Ms. Kauppinen and her passenger, Mr. Petri Hämäläinen (age 40), were unharmed but shaken from the incident.

The foggy conditions and poor visibility undoubtedly contributed to this accident. Road maintenance crews had been working throughout the day to clear the roads of leaves and debris, but the fog that set in during the evening made it difficult for drivers to navigate safely.

This report will be forwarded to the Traffic Police Unit for further investigation and potential charges. The road was closed for several hours while the incident was cleared and the vehicles were towed away. We remind all motorists to drive with caution, especially in adverse weather conditions, and to always prioritize safety on our roads.
