 Traffic Incident Report

Date: 24.11.2022
Location: Kalajoki, Finland
Incident Time: 08:37 (Morning)

Incident Summary:
A traffic collision occurred between two vehicles on Mäkelänkatu street near the intersection with Kauppakatu, in the heart of Kalajoki. The incident involved a silver Volkswagen Golf TSI, license plate F-ABC 123, driven by Mr. Jukka Saarinen (45 years old), and a black Toyota Corolla Hybrid, license plate O-DEF 456, driven by Ms. Liisa Mäkelä (38 years old).

According to eyewitness accounts, the foggy conditions significantly reduced visibility on the road, making it difficult for drivers to navigate. Mr. Saarinen was reportedly traveling at a speed slightly above the posted 50 km/h limit due to his late arrival at work. Ms. Mäkelä, on the other hand, was driving cautiously, adapting her speed to the poor weather conditions.

The incident occurred when Mr. Saarinen's vehicle failed to stop at the red light at the intersection of Mäkelänkatu and Kauppakatu, colliding with Ms. Mäkelä's car as it proceeded through the green light. The impact caused both vehicles to spin out of control, blocking the intersection and causing a temporary traffic disruption.

Upon arrival at the scene, emergency services found Mr. Saarinen and his passenger, Mrs. Sari Saarinen (42 years old), uninjured but shaken up. Ms. Mäkelä and her passenger, Mr. Petri Kauppi (50 years old), were transported to the local hospital for precautionary checks due to minor injuries sustained in the collision.

The Volkswagen Golf sustained significant front-end damage, with the bumper and hood crumpling upon impact. The Toyota Corolla Hybrid suffered damage to its passenger side, with the door and fender being dented and scratched.

Investigations are ongoing to determine the exact cause of the collision and any contributing factors. Witness statements will be collected, and traffic camera footage from the area will be reviewed for further evidence.

This report is preliminary and subject to change as the investigation progresses.
