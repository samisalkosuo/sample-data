Incident Narrative:
On June 5, 2023, at approximately 14:30, a traffic incident occurred on Kaarina Road near the intersection with Aura Street in Turku. The incident involved two vehicles: a silver 2018 Volvo V60 (license plate F-XYZ 123) driven by Mr. Juhani Siltala, aged 45, and a red 2021 Toyota Corolla (license plate O-ABC 987) driven by Ms. Liisa Koskela, aged 38.

According to eyewitness accounts, both vehicles were traveling in the same direction on Kaarina Road when the incident occurred. Mr. Siltala, who was driving the Volvo, reportedly lost control of his vehicle due to the slippery road conditions caused by the light rain. The Volvo veered into the opposite lane and collided with Ms. Koskela's Toyota Corolla head-on.

Upon arrival at the scene, emergency services found both vehicles severely damaged but with no immediate life-threatening injuries reported for either driver or passengers. Mr. Siltala was traveling with his wife, Mrs. Marja Siltala, aged 43, and their two children, aged 8 and 10. Ms. Koskela was alone in her vehicle at the time of the incident.

The road was closed for approximately three hours while emergency services attended to the scene and cleared debris. The incident is currently under investigation by local authorities, with a focus on the role of the weather conditions and potential contributing factors such as vehicle maintenance or driver error.
