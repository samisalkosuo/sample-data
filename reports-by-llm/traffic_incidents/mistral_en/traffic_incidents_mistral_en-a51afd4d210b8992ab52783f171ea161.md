 Title: Traffic Incident Report
Date: March 20, 2025
Location: Huittinen, Finland
Incident Number: HUIT-250320-001

On the day of March 20, 2025, at approximately 14:37 hours, a traffic incident occurred on Kauppakatu (Shopping Street) near the intersection with Linnankatu (Castle Street), in the heart of Huittinen. The incident involved two vehicles: a silver Volvo XC90 with license plate FIN-ABC 123 and a black Mercedes E-Class with license plate FIN-DEF 456.

Witness accounts suggest that the Volvo, driven by Mr. Juhani Mäki (age 45, resident of Kauppakatu 27), was traveling southbound on Kauppakatu at a moderate speed. Simultaneously, the Mercedes, driven by Ms. Sanna Koskela (age 32, resident of Linnankatu 19), was turning left from Linnankatu onto Kauppakatu.

The snowy conditions and poor visibility due to heavy snowfall made it difficult for both drivers to maintain control of their vehicles. As Ms. Koskela began her turn, the Mercedes slid on the icy road, crossing into the path of the oncoming Volvo. The impact occurred near the address Kauppakatu 35.

Both drivers reported no injuries, but the front ends of both vehicles sustained significant damage. Mr. Mäki's Volvo suffered a collapsed front bumper and a damaged radiator grille, while Ms. Koskela's Mercedes had a dented passenger side door and a shattered headlight.

The Huittinen Police Department was notified immediately, and officers arrived at the scene within minutes to manage traffic and investigate the incident. The road was closed for approximately one hour while the vehicles were moved to the side of the road and the scene was documented.

This report will be forwarded to the Traffic Accident Investigation Unit for further analysis and determination of any potential violations or contributing factors. The incident serves as a reminder to all drivers to exercise caution, especially during adverse weather conditions.
