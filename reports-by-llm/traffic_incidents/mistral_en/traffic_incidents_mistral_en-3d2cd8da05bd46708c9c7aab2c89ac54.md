On the evening of August 18, 2024, at approximately 19:30 local time, a three-vehicle collision occurred on Kauppakatu (Shopping Street) near the intersection with Miettisalmentie (Mietti Farm Road). The incident involved vehicles driven by Mr. Jari Lehto (Vehicle A), Ms. Liisa M채ki (Vehicle B), and Mr. Antti Niemi (Vehicle C).

According to eyewitness accounts, Mr. Lehto was traveling southbound on Kauppakatu in a 2024 Volvo XC90 (license plate F-ABC 123) at an estimated speed of 60 km/h. Ms. M채ki was driving northbound in a 2023 Toyota Corolla Hybrid (license plate F-DEF 456) at approximately the same speed. Mr. Niemi, who was traveling east on Miettisalmentie in a 2022 Ford Fiesta ST (license plate G-XYZ 789), failed to stop at the red light and entered the intersection, causing the collision.

The incident occurred during a windy evening with gusts, which significantly impacted the scene. Witnesses reported that Mr. Lehto attempted to swerve to avoid the oncoming vehicles but was unable to do so due to the strong winds. The Toyota Corolla Hybrid and Ford Fiesta ST collided with the Volvo XC90 in the intersection, causing extensive damage to all three vehicles.

Upon arrival, emergency services found Mr. Lehto and Ms. M채ki uninjured but shaken. Mr. Niemi was transported to the local hospital for treatment of minor injuries sustained during the collision. The road was closed for approximately two hours while the scene was cleared and investigations were conducted.

The incident remains under investigation, with a focus on determining whether weather conditions or driver error played a role in the accident. Preliminary findings suggest that Mr. Niemi may have been distracted prior to entering the intersection, contributing to the collision.

This report is based on eyewitness accounts and initial investigations. Further analysis will be conducted to confirm the details of the incident and determine any additional factors that may have contributed to the accident.
