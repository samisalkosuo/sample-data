 Title: Traffic Incident Report

Date: December 12, 2022
Location: Taipalsaari, Finland
Incident Number: TAIP-221212-003

On the morning of December 12, 2022, at approximately 8:45 AM, a multi-vehicle collision occurred on Kauppakatu (Shopping Street), near the intersection with Mannerheimintie (Mannerheim Avenue). The incident involved three vehicles and resulted in minor injuries to several individuals.

The following is a detailed account of the events leading up to the accident:

1. Vehicle 1, a silver Volvo XC60 (license plate F-ABC 123) driven by Mr. Juhani Särkijärvi (age 45), was traveling southbound on Kauppakatu. Mr. Särkijärvi was en route to his workplace, the Taipalsaari Bank, located at Kauppakatu 10.

2. Vehicle 2, a red Toyota Corolla (license plate O-DEF 456) driven by Ms. Liisa Mäkelä (age 38), was also traveling southbound on Kauppakatu but was turning left onto Mannerheimintie to head towards the city center.

3. Vehicle 3, a blue Ford Focus (license plate G-HIJ 789) driven by Mr. Eero Koskela (age 25), was approaching the intersection from Mannerheimintie, intending to continue southbound on Kauppakatu.

As heavy rain fell, visibility was significantly reduced, and the road surfaces became slick. At the intersection, Vehicle 1 failed to stop at the red light due to the poor weather conditions and collided with Vehicle 2, which had already begun its left turn. The impact caused Vehicle 2 to spin out of control, striking Vehicle 3 as it attempted to avoid the collision.

Emergency services arrived on the scene promptly, with an ambulance attending to the injured parties and a tow truck removing the damaged vehicles. Mr. Särkijärvi and Ms. Mäkelä sustained minor injuries and were transported to Taipalsaari Hospital for treatment. No other passengers were reported injured in the incident.

Witness statements corroborate that the heavy rain and slick road conditions contributed to the accident, as drivers struggled to maintain control of their vehicles. The investigation is ongoing, with a focus on determining whether any traffic laws were violated and assessing the role of weather conditions in the collision.

This report will be updated as more information becomes available.
