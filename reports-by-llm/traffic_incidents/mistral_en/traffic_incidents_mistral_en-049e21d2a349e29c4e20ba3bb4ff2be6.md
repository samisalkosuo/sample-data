Location: Evijärvi, Finland
Incident Number: EJR-2025-00378

On the day of April 5th, 2025, at approximately 14:36 hours, a multi-vehicle collision occurred on Kauppakatu (Shopping Street) near the intersection with Linnankatu (Castle Street), in the heart of Evijärvi. The incident involved three vehicles and resulted in minor injuries to several individuals.

The following is a detailed account of the events leading up to and including the collision:

14:35 hours - A white Volvo XC90, driven by Mr. Jukka Saarinen (license plate F-XYZ 123), was traveling southbound on Kauppakatu at a speed estimated to be within the posted 50 km/h limit.

14:35 hours - Simultaneously, a black Mercedes E-Class (F-ABC 456) driven by Ms. Liisa Mäki was approaching the same intersection from Linnankatu, also traveling southbound but at an estimated speed of approximately 70 km/h.

14:35 hours - A red Toyota Corolla (F-DEF 789), driven by Mr. Marko Nurmi, was stationary at a stop sign on Linnankatu, waiting to turn left onto Kauppakatu.

As Mr. Saarinen's Volvo approached the intersection, he failed to notice the heavy rain reducing his visibility and the stopped Toyota Corolla due to its smaller size. Consequently, Mr. Saarinen collided with the rear of the stationary Corolla, causing it to spin out into the path of Ms. Mäki's Mercedes.

14:36 hours - The impact between the Volvo and Toyota caused the Corolla to be pushed forward, directly into the path of the oncoming Mercedes. Ms. Mäki was unable to avoid the collision, resulting in a T-bone impact between her vehicle and the spinning Corolla.

14:37 hours - Emergency services were notified immediately following the incident, with police, fire department, and ambulance arriving at the scene within minutes. The road was closed for approximately two hours to allow for the investigation and clearance of the vehicles.

Upon inspection, it was determined that Mr. Saarinen's Volvo sustained significant front-end damage, while Ms. Mäki's Mercedes suffered extensive damage to its passenger side. The Toyota Corolla incurred damage to both its rear and front ends as a result of the two collisions.

All parties involved were assessed by medical personnel on scene, with Mr. Saarinen and Ms. Mäki being treated for minor injuries and released shortly thereafter. No other individuals were reported injured during the incident.

The investigation into this collision is ongoing, with a focus on determining the contributing factors of reduced visibility due to heavy rain and potential speeding by Mr. Saarinen. Relevant traffic laws will be enforced as appropriate once the investigation has been completed.

This report is submitted for the record and will be made available to all relevant parties upon request.
