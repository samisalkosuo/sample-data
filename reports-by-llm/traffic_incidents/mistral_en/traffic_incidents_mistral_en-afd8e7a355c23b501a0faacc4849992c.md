 Title: Traffic Incident Report
Date: July 21, 2024
Location: Karstula, Finland
Incident Number: KAR-24-3567

On the morning of July 21, 2024, at approximately 8:30 AM local time, a traffic incident occurred on Mäkelänkatu (Mäkelä Street), near the intersection with Kauppakatu (Shopping Street). The incident involved two vehicles: a silver Toyota Corolla (license plate F-ABC 123) driven by Mr. Juhani Särkijärvi, aged 45, and a black Volkswagen Golf (license plate O-DEF 456) driven by Ms. Liisa Mäkeläinen, aged 38.

According to eyewitness accounts, both vehicles were traveling in the same direction on Mäkelänkatu when the incident occurred. Mr. Särkijärvi was approaching the intersection at a moderate speed, while Ms. Mäkeläinen was following closely behind. As Mr. Särkijärvi entered the intersection, he failed to notice that the traffic light had turned red, and he proceeded into the intersection.

Ms. Mäkeläinen, who was unable to stop in time due to the proximity of Mr. Särkijärvi's vehicle, collided with the rear end of his Toyota Corolla. The impact caused both vehicles to spin out of control and come to a halt on the opposite side of Mäkelänkatu.

Upon arrival at the scene, emergency services found no injuries reported among the drivers or passengers involved. Both Mr. Särkijärvi and Ms. Mäkeläinen were visibly shaken but otherwise unharmed. Witnesses at the scene provided statements corroborating the sequence of events leading up to the collision.

The weather conditions on the day of the incident were dry but cold, with temperatures hovering around 10°C (50°F). The road surfaces were wet from dew, which may have contributed to the reduced traction experienced by Ms. Mäkeläinen's vehicle during the collision.

The Toyota Corolla sustained significant damage to its rear bumper and tailgate, while the Volkswagen Golf suffered minor damage to its front bumper. Both vehicles were towed from the scene for further inspection and repairs.

This incident serves as a reminder to all drivers to adhere to traffic regulations, especially at intersections, and to maintain a safe following distance in order to prevent similar incidents from occurring. The investigation into this matter is ongoing, with potential charges being considered against Mr. Särkijärvi for failing to obey a red traffic light.
