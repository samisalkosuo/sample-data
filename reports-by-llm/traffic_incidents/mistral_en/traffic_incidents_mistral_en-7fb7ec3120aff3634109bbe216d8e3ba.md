 Title: Traffic Incident Report - 08.02.2023, Lemland, Finland

On the night of February 8th, 2023, at approximately 10:45 PM local time, an unfortunate multi-vehicle collision occurred on Kauppakatu (Shop Street), a major road in the picturesque municipality of Lemland, Finland. The incident involved eleven vehicles, resulting in various degrees of damage and injuries.

The sequence of events began when a southbound Toyota RAV4, driven by Mr. Juhani Mäki (license plate F-XYZ 123), lost control due to mixed snow and rain conditions on the road surface. The vehicle veered off the roadway and collided with a street sign at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Merikatu (Sea Street).

The impact caused Mr. Mäki's vehicle to spin out, blocking one lane of traffic. In an attempt to avoid the obstruction, a northbound Volvo XC90 driven by Ms. Liisa Koskela (license plate O-ABC 456) swerved into the opposite lane, colliding with a southbound Volkswagen Golf driven by Mr. Markku Saari (license plate L-DEF 789).

The subsequent chain reaction involved seven additional vehicles, resulting in various degrees of damage and injuries. Among those injured were Ms. Koskela, Mr. Saari, and three passengers: Mr. Eero Hämäläinen, Ms. Sanna Virtanen, and Mr. Joonas Kiviranta, all traveling in the Volkswagen Golf.

Emergency services arrived at the scene promptly, with the first responders reporting that the road was slick and slippery due to the mixed snow and rain conditions. The weather added an additional challenge to the rescue efforts, as visibility was reduced, and the road surface remained treacherous.

The Finnish Transport Agency has been notified of the incident, and Kauppakatu will be closed for several hours while the cleanup and investigation take place. Motorists are advised to avoid the area and seek alternative routes if possible.

This report is preliminary in nature and subject to further investigation by the Lemland Police Department's Traffic Investigation Unit. Further updates will be provided as more information becomes available.
