 Title: Traffic Incident Report - 10.03.2024, Karstula, Finland

Incident Summary:
On March 10th, 2024, at approximately 9:15 AM, a three-vehicle collision occurred on the Tieveskoskenkatu road in Karstula, Finland. The incident involved vehicles with Finnish license plates as follows:

1. A silver Volvo V60 (PLATE: FAB-123) driven by Mr. Juhani Lehtonen (45 years old), traveling southbound from the Tieveskoski intersection.
2. A red Toyota Corolla (PLATE: XYZ-456) driven by Ms. Sanna Mäkelä (32 years old), overtaking Mr. Lehtonen's vehicle on a curve, heading northbound towards the Tieveskoski intersection.
3. A black Mercedes E-Class (PLATE: DEF-789) driven by Mr. Markku Koskinen (50 years old), who was approaching the collision site from behind Ms. Mäkelä's vehicle, also heading northbound.

Witness Statements:
A local resident, Mrs. Liisa Kivinen (62 years old), living at 12 Tieveskoskenkatu, reported seeing Ms. Mäkelä overtaking Mr. Lehtonen's vehicle on a curve, just before the collision occurred. She stated that the road was wet due to light rain and that Ms. Mäkelä appeared to be driving too fast for the conditions.

Another witness, Mr. Petri Niemi (38 years old), who works at the nearby Tieveskoski factory, reported seeing Mr. Koskinen's Mercedes swerving to avoid colliding with Ms. Mäkelä's Toyota Corolla but ended up hitting the rear of Mr. Lehtonen's Volvo V60 instead.

Incident Description:
According to witness statements and the physical evidence at the scene, it appears that Ms. Mäkelä was overtaking Mr. Lehtonen's vehicle on a curve when she lost control due to the wet road conditions. As a result, her Toyota Corolla veered into the southbound lane, directly into the path of Mr. Koskinen's Mercedes E-Class.

In an attempt to avoid colliding with Ms. Mäkelä's vehicle, Mr. Koskinen swerved his Mercedes, but unfortunately, he ended up hitting the rear of Mr. Lehtonen's Volvo V60. The impact caused all three vehicles to spin out of control and come to a stop on the road.

Damage Assessment:
Upon inspection, it was determined that Ms. Mäkelä's Toyota Corolla sustained significant front-end damage, with the driver's side being the most affected. Mr. Lehtonen's Volvo V60 suffered rear-end damage, and Mr. Koskinen's Mercedes E-Class had minor damage to its front bumper and grille.

Conclusion:
The preliminary investigation suggests that this incident was caused by Ms. Mäkelä driving too fast for the wet road conditions and losing control while overtaking another vehicle. The collision resulted in a three-vehicle accident, causing damage to all vehicles involved. Further investigation is ongoing to determine any potential contributing factors or violations of traffic laws.
