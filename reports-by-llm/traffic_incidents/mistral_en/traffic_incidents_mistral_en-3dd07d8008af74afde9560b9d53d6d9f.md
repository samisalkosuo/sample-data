 Title: Traffic Incident Report
Date: January 13, 2024
Location: Inari, Finland
Incident Number: TI-2024-INA-001

On the night of January 13, 2024, at approximately 23:37 hours, a traffic incident occurred on Pohjankulma Street (Highway 45) near the intersection with Lumikko Road. The incident involved two vehicles: a silver Toyota RAV4 (license plate F-XYZ123) driven by Mr. Jukka Lehto, aged 38, and a black Volkswagen Golf (license plate O-ABC987) driven by Ms. Liisa M채ki, aged 45.

According to eyewitness accounts, both vehicles were traveling in the same direction when Mr. Lehto's Toyota RAV4 lost traction due to wet and slippery road conditions. The vehicle skidded sideways into the oncoming lane, colliding with Ms. M채ki's Volkswagen Golf.

The impact caused significant damage to both vehicles. The front end of Mr. Lehto's Toyota RAV4 was crumpled, and the airbags deployed. Ms. M채ki's Volkswagen Golf sustained damage to its passenger side, with the door being dented inward.

Upon arrival at the scene, emergency services found both drivers unharmed but shaken up. Mr. Lehto was visibly distressed and expressed remorse for the incident. Ms. M채ki was also upset but able to provide her account of the events.

Witnesses reported that the road had been wet due to recent snowfall, making it slippery in places. The weather conditions were overcast with occasional light rain, further contributing to the hazardous driving conditions.

The incident caused a temporary closure of Pohjankulma Street, with traffic being diverted via Lumikko Road and Kielo Street. The vehicles were towed away by 01:30 hours, and the road was reopened by 02:00 hours.

The incident is currently under investigation by the Inari Police Department. Preliminary findings suggest that Mr. Lehto may have been driving too fast for the weather conditions, which contributed to his loss of control. However, further analysis of the vehicles' data recorders and witness statements will be required to determine the exact cause of the incident.
