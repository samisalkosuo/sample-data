Location: Kiuruvesi, Finland
Incident Number: KV-241218-003

On the evening of December 18, 2024, at approximately 19:37 hours, a traffic incident occurred on Mäkelänkatu (Mäkelä Street) near the intersection with Kauppakatu (Shopping Street), in the heart of Kiuruvesi. The incident involved two vehicles: a silver Toyota Corolla (license plate F-XYZ 123) driven by Mr. Jari Mäkelä, aged 45, and a black Volkswagen Golf (license plate O-ABC 987) driven by Ms. Liisa Kauppi, aged 38.

According to eyewitness accounts, both vehicles were traveling in the same direction when heavy rain began to fall, significantly reducing visibility on the road. Mr. Mäkelä, who was driving the Toyota Corolla, lost control of his vehicle due to the slippery conditions and skidded into the opposite lane, colliding with Ms. Kauppi's Volkswagen Golf.

The impact caused both vehicles to spin out of control, blocking the entire road. The Toyota Corolla sustained significant damage to its front end, while the Volkswagen Golf suffered damage to its rear and side panels. Both drivers and passengers remained in their vehicles until emergency services arrived at the scene.

Mr. Mäkelä and his passenger, Ms. Sari Mäkelä (aged 42), were uninjured but shaken up by the incident. Ms. Kauppi and her passenger, Mr. Petri Kauppi (aged 7), sustained minor injuries and were transported to Kiuruvesi Hospital for further evaluation and treatment.

The road was closed for approximately two hours while emergency services attended to the scene and cleared the debris. The heavy rain continued throughout the incident, making it difficult for other motorists and emergency responders alike.

This report will be forwarded to the appropriate authorities for further investigation and analysis of the contributing factors in this traffic incident, including road conditions, weather, and driver behavior.
