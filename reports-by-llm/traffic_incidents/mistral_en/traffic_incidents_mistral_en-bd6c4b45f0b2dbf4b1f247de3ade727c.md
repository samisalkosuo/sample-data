On the night of March 4th, 2024, at approximately 23:37 hours, a three-vehicle collision occurred on Helsinki-Kuusamo Road (Highway 6) near the intersection with Kylänkyläntie (Road 518), in Kaavi municipality.

The following vehicles were involved:
1. A silver 2023 Volvo XC90, license plate F-ABC 123, driven by Mr. Juhani Mäki (45) and carrying two passengers, Ms. Sanna Niemi (38) and their child, Elias (7).
2. A black 2022 Toyota Corolla, license plate O-DEF 456, driven by Mr. Markku Koskela (32).
3. A red 2021 Ford Fiesta, license plate G-HIJ 789, driven by Ms. Liisa Lappalainen (28).

According to eyewitness accounts, the incident began when Mr. Mäki's Volvo, traveling northbound on Highway 6, suddenly swerved into the southbound lane without apparent reason. The Volvo collided head-on with Mr. Koskela's Corolla, causing both vehicles to spin out of control and come to a halt in the median strip.

Ms. Lappalainen, who was following closely behind Mr. Koskela, managed to swerve her Ford Fiesta to avoid the initial collision but ended up hitting the rear of the Volvo as it skidded back into the northbound lane.

The weather conditions were clear and sunny, with temperatures hovering around -5°C. The road surface was dry and well-lit, providing optimal visibility for drivers. However, the sudden swerve by Mr. Mäki's vehicle remains unexplained at this time.

Upon arrival, emergency services found all parties involved conscious but shaken. Mr. Mäki sustained minor injuries to his left arm, while Ms. Niemi complained of neck pain. Both were transported to the local hospital for further evaluation and treatment. Mr. Koskela and Ms. Lappalainen did not report any injuries.

The vehicles involved in the collision suffered significant damage. Mr. Mäki's Volvo sustained front-end and side impact damage, with the airbags deploying upon impact. The Toyota Corolla had extensive front-end and undercarriage damage, while Ms. Lappalainen's Ford Fiesta sustained rear-end damage.

The incident is currently under investigation by local authorities. Witness statements are being collected, and further analysis of the vehicles involved will be conducted to determine the exact cause of the collision.

This report is preliminary in nature and subject to change as the investigation progresses. Updates will be provided as necessary.
