 Title: Traffic Incident Report - Mynämäki, Finland - 24.02.2024, 23:15

On the night of February 24th, 2024, at approximately 23:15, a multi-vehicle collision occurred on Kauppakatu (Shopping Street) in Mynämäki, Finland. The incident involved eleven vehicles, resulting in extensive damage and injuries to several individuals.

The sequence of events began when a 37-year-old driver identified as Mr. Jukka Saarinen, operating a 2019 Volvo XC60 (license plate F-XYZ 123) lost control of his vehicle due to heavy rain and thunderstorm conditions. Witnesses report that the vehicle hydroplaned on the wet road surface, swerving into the opposite lane and colliding with an oncoming 2020 Toyota Corolla (license plate F-ABC 456) driven by a 29-year-old woman named Ms. Liisa Mäki.

The impact of this initial collision caused a chain reaction, as the Volvo was propelled into a nearby parking lot, where it collided with a stationary 2018 Mercedes-Benz E-Class (license plate F-DEF 789). Simultaneously, the Toyota Corolla spun out of control and struck a 2016 Ford Focus (license plate F-GHI 901) driven by a 45-year-old man named Mr. Petri Koskela.

As the chaos unfolded, additional vehicles became involved in the incident. A 2023 Hyundai Tucson (license plate F-JKL 123) swerved to avoid the collision but ended up hitting a parked 2015 Volkswagen Golf (license plate F-MNO 456). Meanwhile, a 2022 Kia Sportage (license plate F-PQR 789) attempted to brake but was unable to stop in time and collided with the rear of the Volvo XC60.

The final vehicles involved were a 2014 Mazda CX-5 (license plate F-STU 901) driven by a 34-year-old woman named Ms. Anna Lehto, who was attempting to turn onto Kauppakatu from Linnankatu (Castle Street), and a 2021 Honda CR-V (license plate F-UVW 123) driven by a 56-year-old man named Mr. Matti Nurmi. The Mazda CX-5 collided with the rear of the Kia Sportage, while the Honda CR-V swerved to avoid the collision and ended up striking a street sign.

Upon arrival at the scene, emergency services found several individuals requiring medical attention. Mr. Saarinen, Ms. Mäki, Mr. Koskela, and Ms. Lehto were transported to the local hospital for treatment of non-life-threatening injuries. The other drivers and passengers involved in the incident sustained minor injuries or no physical harm but were shaken by the experience.

The road conditions played a significant role in this incident, with heavy rain and thunderstorms creating slippery surfaces that made it difficult for drivers to maintain control of their vehicles. Additionally, poor visibility due to the storm contributed to the chaotic nature of the collision.

The Mynämäki Police Department is currently investigating the incident, gathering witness statements and analyzing evidence from the scene. The road was closed for several hours while cleanup crews worked to remove the damaged vehicles and repair any damage to infrastructure.

This report will be updated as more information becomes available regarding the investigation and recovery efforts.
