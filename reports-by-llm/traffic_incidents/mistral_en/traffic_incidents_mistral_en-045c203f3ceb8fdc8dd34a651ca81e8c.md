On the night of January 31st, 2025, at approximately 23:47 hours, a three-vehicle collision occurred on Kauppakatu (Shopping Street), near the intersection with Linnankatu (Castle Street) in Multia. The incident involved vehicles with the following details:

1. Vehicle A - A white Volvo XC90 (license plate FIN-ABC 123) driven by Mr. Juhani Mäki, aged 45, and carrying two passengers, Ms. Sanna Niemi, aged 42, and their child, aged 7.

2. Vehicle B - A black Mercedes E-Class (license plate FIN-DEF 456) driven by Mr. Marko Saari, aged 38, with no passengers.

3. Vehicle C - A red Toyota Corolla (license plate FIN-GHI 789) driven by Ms. Liisa Koskela, aged 28, and carrying one passenger, Mr. Eero Lappalainen, aged 25.

According to eyewitness accounts, the incident began when Vehicle A, traveling south on Kauppakatu, approached the intersection with Linnankatu. Simultaneously, Vehicle B was turning left from Linnankatu onto Kauppakatu, while Vehicle C was proceeding north on Kauppakatu.

In the light rain that fell throughout the evening, visibility was reduced, and the wet road surface made it difficult for drivers to maintain control of their vehicles. As Vehicle B turned left, it collided with Vehicle A, causing both vehicles to spin out of control. Vehicle C, unable to stop in time due to the initial collision, crashed into the rear of Vehicle A.

The impact caused significant damage to all three vehicles. Vehicle A sustained front-end and side damage, while Vehicle B had extensive front and rear damage. Vehicle C suffered minor front-end damage but was able to move off the road after the collision.

Emergency services arrived at the scene within minutes, with police officers, firefighters, and paramedics all responding to the incident. The passengers in Vehicles A and B were assessed for injuries, but no one required hospitalization. Mr. Mäki reported minor whiplash, while Ms. Niemi and their child were unharmed.

The road was closed for approximately two hours while the scene was cleared and evidence was collected. The vehicles were towed away, and the drivers involved were issued traffic violation notices for careless driving in adverse weather conditions.

This report is based on eyewitness accounts, physical evidence at the scene, and statements from the drivers involved. The incident remains under investigation by the Multia Police Department's Traffic Unit.
