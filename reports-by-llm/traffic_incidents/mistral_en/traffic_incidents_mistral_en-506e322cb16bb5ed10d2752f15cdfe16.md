Time of Occurrence: 19:37 (evening)
Weather Conditions: Windy with gusts

Upon arrival at the scene on Kauppakatu (Shopping Street), near the intersection with Miettisalmentie, I found three vehicles involved in a collision. The incident occurred between a black Volvo XC90 (license plate F-ABC 123) driven by Mr. Juhani Mattila (age 45, resident of Kauppakatu 2), a silver Toyota Corolla (license plate O-DEF 456) driven by Ms. Sanna Koskela (age 30, resident of Miettisalmentie 17), and a red Ford Focus (license plate G-HIJ 789) driven by Mr. Marko Saarinen (age 28, resident of Kauppakatu 15).

According to eyewitness accounts, the incident began when Mr. Mattila was traveling southbound on Kauppakatu at a speed estimated between 60-70 km/h. Ms. Koskela was turning left from Miettisalmentie onto Kauppakatu, and Mr. Saarinen was stationary in the right lane of Kauppakatu, waiting to turn right onto Miettisalmentie.

As Ms. Koskela began her turn, a sudden gust of wind caused her vehicle to drift into the path of Mr. Mattila's Volvo. Unable to stop in time due to the high speed and poor visibility, Mr. Mattila collided with the side of Ms. Koskela's Toyota Corolla. The impact caused Ms. Koskela's vehicle to spin out of control, striking Mr. Saarinen's Ford Focus that was still stationary in the right lane.

Upon arrival, all parties involved were uninjured but shaken. Ms. Koskela's Toyota Corolla sustained significant damage to the driver's side, with a collapsed front wheel and extensive bodywork damage. Mr. Mattila's Volvo XC90 had minor damage to the front bumper and grille, while Mr. Saarinen's Ford Focus suffered moderate damage to the passenger side, including a cracked windshield and dented door.

The road was wet due to recent rainfall, and the gusty winds made visibility difficult for all drivers involved. I issued traffic violation warnings to both Mr. Mattila and Ms. Koskela for excessive speed and failure to yield while turning, respectively. No further legal action is anticipated at this time.

This report will be forwarded to the Tervo Traffic Department for their review and any necessary follow-up actions.
