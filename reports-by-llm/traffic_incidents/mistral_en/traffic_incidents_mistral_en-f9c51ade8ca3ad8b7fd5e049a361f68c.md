 Traffic Incident Report

Date: 25.05.2024
Location: Multia, Finland
Incident Number: TI-24-1378
Time of Incident: 23:37 (Night)
Weather Conditions: Overcast with occasional light rain and visibility reduced to approximately 200 meters.

Upon arrival at the scene, I found myself on Kauppakatu, a main road in Multia, near the intersection with Linnankatu. The incident involved five vehicles, causing significant traffic disruption and delaying emergency services' response time.

The first vehicle involved was a 2019 Volvo XC60 (license plate F-XYZ 123) driven by Mr. Jukka Lehto (age 45), traveling southbound on Kauppakatu. The second vehicle, a 2018 Toyota Corolla (F-ABC 987), was driven by Ms. Liisa Mäki (age 32) and was stationary at the red light on Linnankatu, waiting to turn left onto Kauppakatu.

As Mr. Lehto approached the intersection, he failed to notice that the traffic light had turned yellow due to reduced visibility caused by the overcast weather conditions. In an attempt to beat the red light, Mr. Lehto accelerated, causing his vehicle to collide with Ms. Mäki's stationary Toyota Corolla.

The impact of the collision caused a chain reaction, involving three additional vehicles: a 2017 Ford Focus (F-DEF 456) driven by Mr. Marko Saari (age 28), a 2020 Mercedes-Benz C-Class (F-GHI 789) driven by Ms. Anna Koskela (age 35), and a 2016 Volkswagen Golf (F-JKL 098) driven by Mr. Petri Niemi (age 42).

All drivers and passengers involved in the incident were uninjured, but all vehicles sustained significant damage. The Volvo XC60 was pushed into a nearby lamp post, causing it to break and obstruct traffic on Kauppakatu. The Toyota Corolla suffered front-end damage and had to be towed away from the scene.

The Ford Focus, Mercedes-Benz C-Class, and Volkswagen Golf all sustained varying degrees of damage but were able to be driven away from the scene under their own power.

Witness statements were taken from three individuals who observed the incident. All agreed that the overcast weather conditions had significantly reduced visibility at the time of the accident.

The road was closed for approximately two hours while emergency services attended to the scene and cleared debris. Traffic was diverted through side streets, causing delays for motorists in the area.

This report will be forwarded to the appropriate authorities for further investigation and potential charges against Mr. Jukka Lehto for running a red light and reckless driving.
