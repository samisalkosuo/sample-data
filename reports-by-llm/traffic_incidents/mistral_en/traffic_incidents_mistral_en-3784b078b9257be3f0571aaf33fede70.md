 **Traffic Incident Report**

Date: 06.09.2023
Location: Pyht채채, Finland
Incident Number: PYH-230906-001
Time of Occurrence: 23:45 (Night)
Weather Conditions: Foggy

Upon arrival at the scene, I found myself on Miestentie, a quiet road leading out of the town center towards the northern suburbs. The incident occurred near the intersection with Kyl채kartanonkatu, where two vehicles were involved in a collision.

The first vehicle, a silver Volvo V60 with license plate FIN-ABC 123, was traveling southbound on Miestentie when it collided with a red Toyota Corolla (license plate FIN-DEF 456) that had failed to yield at the intersection. The Volvo sustained significant front-end damage, while the Toyota's front bumper and left headlight were damaged as well.

Witnesses at the scene reported that the foggy conditions had reduced visibility, making it difficult for both drivers to see each other in time to avoid the collision. A local resident named Anna M채ki (witness statement WS-230906-001) stated that she was walking her dog near the intersection when she heard screeching tires and saw the impact.

Upon further investigation, I found no signs of intoxication or reckless driving on the part of either driver. Both drivers were uninjured but shaken by the incident. The Toyota's driver, Mr. Jukka Saarinen (driver statement DS-230906-001), admitted to being distracted by his phone at the time of the collision.

The vehicles were towed from the scene, and the road was cleared by 01:30. The incident is currently under investigation, with charges pending against Mr. Saarinen for careless driving causing an accident.
