Incident Description:
On the night of June 17, 2025, a traffic incident occurred on Kauppakatu, a major road in Alavus. The incident involved two vehicles - a black Volvo XC90 T8 and a silver Toyota Corolla Hybrid.

According to witness statements, the incident began when Mr. Jari Kivinen (driver of the Volvo) was traveling southbound on Kauppakatu at approximately 23:37. Ms. Liisa Nurmi (driver of the Toyota) was also heading southbound in the same lane, slightly behind the Volvo.

As both vehicles approached the intersection with Pohjankatu, the mixed snow and rain conditions made the road slippery, causing reduced visibility for drivers. Witnesses reported that Mr. Kivinen attempted to slow down but lost control of his vehicle due to the adverse weather conditions. The Volvo began to slide sideways across the road, colliding with the Toyota Corolla Hybrid driven by Ms. Nurmi.

The impact caused both vehicles to spin out of control and come to a stop on the opposite side of Kauppakatu. Mr. Kivinen, Ms. Mäki, and Mr. Saarinen in the Volvo sustained minor injuries but were able to exit their vehicle without assistance. Ms. Nurmi was unharmed but shaken up by the incident.

Emergency services arrived at the scene within minutes and assessed the situation. The vehicles sustained significant damage - the front-end of the Volvo was crumpled, while the Toyota had a damaged bumper and fender. Both vehicles were towed away from the scene for further inspection and repairs.

The incident caused a temporary roadblock on Kauppakatu, but traffic resumed normal flow after approximately 45 minutes. The Alavus Police Department is currently investigating the incident and will determine any potential charges based on the findings of the investigation.
