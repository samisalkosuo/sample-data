On the evening of September 5th, 2023, at approximately 19:47 local time, a multiple-vehicle collision occurred on Helsinginkatu, near the intersection with Lappeenranta Street in Kärsämäki, Finland. The incident involved four vehicles and resulted in minor injuries to several individuals.

The following is a detailed account of the events leading up to the accident:

1. Vehicle 1 (Volvo XC60, license plate F-XYZ 123) was traveling southbound on Helsinginkatu at an estimated speed of 60 km/h. The driver, Mr. Juhani Mäki (45 years old), had a passenger, Ms. Sanna Niemi (38 years old).

2. Vehicle 2 (Toyota Corolla, license plate O-ABC 987) was approaching the same intersection from Lappeenranta Street, intending to turn left onto Helsinginkatu. The driver, Ms. Liisa Koskela (34 years old), had a passenger, Mr. Eero Saari (28 years old).

3. As Vehicle 1 approached the intersection, it failed to slow down due to icy road conditions and slid into the path of Vehicle 2, which was preparing to turn left.

4. In an attempt to avoid a collision, Ms. Koskela applied her brakes, but due to the slippery roads, she was unable to stop in time. The front end of Vehicle 2 collided with the side of Vehicle 1.

5. Upon impact, both vehicles spun out of control and were struck by two additional vehicles:
   - Vehicle 3 (Ford Focus, license plate P-DEF 456) was traveling southbound behind Vehicle 1 and could not stop in time to avoid the collision. The driver, Mr. Marko Lappalainen (27 years old), had no passengers.
   - Vehicle 4 (Skoda Octavia, license plate G-HIJ 789) was traveling northbound on Helsinginkatu and was unable to avoid the chaotic scene. The driver, Ms. Anna Lehto (52 years old), had a passenger, Mr. Jari Virtanen (43 years old).

Upon arrival at the scene, emergency services found all parties involved in the collision. Ms. Niemi and Mr. Saari from Vehicle 1 sustained minor injuries and were transported to Kärsämäki Hospital for treatment. The other individuals involved did not report any injuries.

The road was closed for approximately two hours while the scene was cleared, and the vehicles were towed away. The police are investigating the incident further, focusing on the icy road conditions as a contributing factor to the accident.
