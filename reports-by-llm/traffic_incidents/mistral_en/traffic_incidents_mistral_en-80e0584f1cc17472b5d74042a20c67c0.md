 Title: Traffic Incident Report
Date: 08.10.2024
Location: Kärkölä, Finland
Incident Number: 23456789

On the evening of October 8th, 2024, at approximately 19:30 hours, a traffic incident occurred on Miettiselänkatu (Miettisela Street) near the intersection with Kylpylänkatu (Kylpyla Street), in the municipality of Kärkölä. The incident involved two vehicles: a silver 2023 Volvo XC60, license plate F-ABC 123, driven by Mr. Juhani Siltala, and a black 2024 Toyota Corolla, license plate O-DEF 456, driven by Ms. Liisa Mäkelä.

According to eyewitness accounts, both vehicles were traveling in the same direction on Miettiselänkatu when the incident occurred. Mr. Siltala, who was driving the Volvo, reported that he had slowed down due to the light rain and poor visibility, but Ms. Mäkelä, in the Toyota Corolla behind him, did not react in time and collided with the rear of his vehicle.

The impact caused both vehicles to spin out of control, with the Volvo coming to a stop on the side of the road, and the Corolla ending up partially on the sidewalk near the intersection. The scene was chaotic, with concerned bystanders rushing to assist the drivers and passengers.

Upon arrival, emergency services found no serious injuries reported among the four occupants. Mr. Siltala and his passenger, Ms. Anna Siltala, were shaken but otherwise unharmed. Ms. Mäkelä and her passenger, Mr. Petri Mäkelä, also escaped with minor scrapes and bruises.

The road conditions, combined with the light rain, made it difficult for both drivers to maintain control of their vehicles. The incident caused significant traffic disruptions in the area, with police diverting traffic away from the scene until the vehicles could be safely removed.

The investigation into the incident is ongoing, and charges have not yet been filed. Both vehicles sustained substantial damage, with the Volvo's rear bumper and taillights being severely damaged, and the Corolla's front end suffering extensive damage as well.

This report will be updated as more information becomes available.
