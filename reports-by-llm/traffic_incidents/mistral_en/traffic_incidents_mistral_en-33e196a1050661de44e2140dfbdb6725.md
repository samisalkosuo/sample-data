On the morning of February 25th, 2025, at approximately 08:15, a traffic incident occurred on Aapistonkatu, near the intersection with Kauppakatu in Lahti. The incident involved two vehicles: a silver 2023 Volvo XC60 (license plate FIN-ABC 123) driven by Mr. Jukka Saarinen, aged 45, and a black 2024 Toyota Corolla Hybrid (license plate FIN-DEF 456) driven by Ms. Liisa Mäki, aged 38.

According to eyewitness accounts, Mr. Saarinen was traveling southbound on Aapistonkatu, while Ms. Mäki was heading east on Kauppakatu. Both drivers reportedly approached the intersection at a reasonable speed, given the wet and slippery road conditions. However, as Mr. Saarinen's Volvo entered the intersection, he failed to notice that Ms. Mäki's Toyota had a green light and was proceeding straight ahead.

The front left bumper of the Volvo collided with the driver's side door of the Toyota, causing both vehicles to spin out of control. The Volvo came to a stop on the southbound lane of Aapistonkatu, while the Toyota ended up partially blocking the eastbound lane of Kauppakatu.

Upon arrival at the scene, emergency services found no signs of serious injury for either driver or passengers. Mr. Saarinen and his passenger, Ms. Anna Lehto, aged 42, were transported to Lahti Central Hospital for precautionary checks. Ms. Mäki and her passenger, Mr. Markku Koskela, aged 35, declined medical attention at the scene but agreed to be examined later by their personal physicians.

The incident caused significant traffic disruptions in the area, with police diverting vehicles through alternative routes until the scene was cleared. The damaged vehicles were towed away by a local towing service, and the road was reopened at approximately 10:30.

The Lahti Police Department is currently investigating the incident, focusing on potential factors such as visibility, road conditions, and driver error. Both drivers have been issued traffic violation notices for failing to yield right of way at an intersection.
