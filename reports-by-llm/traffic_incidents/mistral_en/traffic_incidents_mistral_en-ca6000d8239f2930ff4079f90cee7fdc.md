Location: Sonkajärvi, Finland
Incident Number: TIS-230222-001

On the night of February 22, 2023, at approximately 23:45 local time, a traffic incident occurred on Kauppakatu (Shopping Street) near the intersection with Mannerheimintie (Mannerheim Road), in Sonkajärvi. The incident involved two vehicles: a silver Toyota Corolla (license plate F-XYZ 123) driven by Mr. Jari Saarinen, aged 45, and a black Volkswagen Golf (license plate O-ABC 987) driven by Ms. Liisa Mäki, aged 38.

According to eyewitness accounts, both vehicles were traveling in the same direction on Kauppakatu when the incident occurred. The road conditions at the time were reported as icy, which likely contributed to the accident. Mr. Saarinen's Toyota Corolla lost traction on an icy patch, causing it to slide sideways into the path of Ms. Mäki's Volkswagen Golf.

Ms. Mäki attempted to swerve to avoid the oncoming vehicle but was unable to do so in time. The front left bumper of her Volkswagen Golf collided with the rear right quarter panel of Mr. Saarinen's Toyota Corolla, causing both vehicles to spin out of control.

The impact caused minor injuries to Ms. Mäki and her passenger, Mr. Petri Koskela, aged 40. They were transported to Sonkajärvi Hospital for treatment. Mr. Saarinen and his passenger, Ms. Anna Hämäläinen, aged 32, were unharmed in the incident.

The vehicles sustained significant damage as a result of the collision. The front left bumper of Ms. Mäki's Volkswagen Golf was crushed, while Mr. Saarinen's Toyota Corolla suffered damage to its rear quarter panel and right taillight. Both vehicles were towed from the scene.

The Sonkajärvi Police Department is investigating the incident. Witness statements are being collected, and the road conditions at the time of the accident are being analyzed. The investigation is ongoing.
