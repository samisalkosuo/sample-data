 Title: Traffic Incident Report
Date: October 1, 2023
Location: Ilmajoki, Finland
Incident Number: ILM-231001-001

On the night of October 1, 2023, at approximately 23:45 local time, a traffic incident occurred on Kauppakatu (Shopping Street) near the intersection with Linnankatu (Castle Street), in Ilmajoki. The incident involved two vehicles: a silver Toyota Corolla (license plate F-ABC 123) driven by Mr. Juhani Särkijärvi, aged 45, and a black Volkswagen Golf (license plate O-DEF 456) driven by Ms. Liisa Mäkelä, aged 38.

According to eyewitness accounts, both vehicles were traveling in the same direction on Kauppakatu when the incident occurred. The snowy conditions and reduced visibility due to falling snowflakes appeared to have contributed to the accident.

The sequence of events was as follows: Mr. Särkijärvi, driving at an estimated speed of 60 km/h in the 50 km/h zone, failed to notice that Ms. Mäkelä's Volkswagen Golf had slowed down due to the adverse weather conditions. As a result, he rear-ended her vehicle, causing both cars to spin out of control and collide with the street sign at the intersection.

Upon arrival, emergency services found Mr. Särkijärvi and Ms. Mäkelä uninjured but shaken up. Both drivers were cooperative and provided their statements to the investigating officer. Witnesses confirmed that neither driver appeared to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs.

The Toyota Corolla sustained significant front-end damage, with the bumper and grille being crushed against the radiator. The Volkswagen Golf suffered damage to its rear bumper and taillights. Both vehicles were towed away from the scene for further inspection and repairs.

The incident caused a temporary roadblock on Kauppakatu, which was cleared by 01:30 local time. The Ilmajoki Police Department would like to remind drivers to exercise caution during adverse weather conditions and to maintain a safe distance from other vehicles.

This report is preliminary and subject to further investigation. Any updates or additional information will be provided as they become available.
