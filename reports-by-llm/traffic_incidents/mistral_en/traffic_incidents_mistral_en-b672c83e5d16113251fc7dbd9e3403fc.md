On the evening of March 18th, 2024, at approximately 19:37 hours, a multi-vehicle collision occurred on Kauppakatu (Shop Street) in the municipality of Taivassalo, Finland. The incident involved ten vehicles, resulting in minor injuries to several individuals and significant traffic disruption.

The following is a detailed account of the events leading up to the accident:

1. Initial Incident (19:37 hours): Mr. Jari Mäki, driving a 2023 Volvo XC60 with license plate F-ABC 123, was traveling southbound on Kauppakatu at an estimated speed of 50 km/h. The road conditions were icy due to the recent drop in temperature, making it difficult for drivers to maintain control over their vehicles. As Mr. Mäki approached the intersection with Linnankatu (Castle Street), he lost traction on his vehicle and began to slide sideways across the road.

2. Chain Reaction Collision (19:37 hours): Unable to react in time, a northbound 2022 Toyota Corolla driven by Ms. Liisa Santalahti (license plate F-DEF 456) collided with Mr. Mäki's Volvo, causing both vehicles to spin out of control and block the southbound lanes. The impact from this collision caused a chain reaction, as several other vehicles were unable to stop in time and also became involved in the accident.

3. Additional Vehicles Involved (19:37-19:40 hours): A 2021 Ford Focus driven by Mr. Marko Koskela (license plate F-GHI 789) collided with Ms. Santalahti's Toyota, while a 2020 Mercedes-Benz E-Class driven by Mr. Juhani Nurmi (license plate F-JKL 123) struck the Volvo from behind. A 2019 Hyundai i30 driven by Ms. Sanna Lehto (license plate F-MNO 456) and a 2018 Volkswagen Golf driven by Mr. Petri Hämäläinen (license plate F-PQR 789) were also involved in the collision, as they attempted to avoid the initial accident but ended up colliding with each other and other vehicles.

4. Witness Accounts: Several witnesses reported that they saw Mr. Mäki's Volvo sliding sideways across the road before the collision occurred. One witness, Ms. Anna-Liisa Kivinen, stated that she had been driving behind Mr. Mäki and was unable to avoid the accident due to the icy conditions. Another witness, Mr. Eero Saarinen, reported seeing several vehicles collide in a chain reaction following the initial incident.

5. Damage Assessment: All involved vehicles sustained significant damage as a result of the collision. Mr. Mäki's Volvo and Ms. Santalahti's Toyota were both towed from the scene due to extensive front-end damage. The other vehicles involved also suffered various degrees of damage, including broken headlights, damaged bumpers, and scratched paintwork.

6. Injuries: Several individuals sustained minor injuries as a result of the collision. Mr. Mäki complained of neck pain, while Ms. Santalahti reported a head injury. Both were transported to the local hospital for treatment. The other drivers involved in the accident did not report any injuries.

7. Traffic Disruption: The collision resulted in significant traffic disruption on Kauppakatu and Linnankatu, with both roads being closed for several hours while emergency services attended to the scene and cleared debris. Diversions were put in place to direct traffic away from the affected area.

8.
