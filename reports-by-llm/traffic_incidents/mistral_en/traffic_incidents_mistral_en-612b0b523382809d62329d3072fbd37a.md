Incident Number: SI-2023-00567

On the evening of April 2nd, 2023, at approximately 19:37 hours, a traffic incident occurred on Kauppakatu (Shopping Street) near the intersection with Linnankatu (Castle Street), in Simo, Finland. The incident involved two vehicles: a silver Volvo XC60 with license plate FIN-ABC 123 and a black Toyota Corolla with license plate FIN-DEF 456.

Witnesses at the scene reported that the Volvo, driven by Mr. Juhani Mäki (age 38, resident of Kauppakatu 23), was traveling southbound on Kauppakatu when it lost traction due to wet and slippery road conditions. The vehicle slid sideways into the intersection, colliding with the Toyota Corolla, driven by Ms. Liisa Koskela (age 45, resident of Linnankatu 17), who was traveling eastbound on Linnankatu.

Ms. Koskela and her passenger, Mr. Marko Hämäläinen (age 8), were uninjured in the incident. However, Mr. Mäki sustained minor injuries to his left arm and was transported to Simo Hospital for treatment. His passenger, Ms. Sari Saarinen (age 35), declined medical attention at the scene.

The Volvo sustained significant damage to its front-left fender and bumper, while the Toyota Corolla suffered damage to its right rear quarter panel and wheel. Both vehicles were towed from the scene for further inspection and repairs.

The incident caused a temporary roadblock on Kauppakatu and Linnankatu, with traffic being diverted through alternative routes. The road was reopened at approximately 21:05 hours after the vehicles were removed and the scene was cleared.

Weather conditions at the time of the incident included rain showers and temperatures around 3°C (37°F), making the roads slick and slippery. Road salt had been applied earlier in the day, but the continuous rain had washed it away, contributing to the accident.

This report is based on eyewitness accounts, physical evidence at the scene, and statements from the drivers involved. The incident remains under investigation by the Simo Police Department's Traffic Unit.
