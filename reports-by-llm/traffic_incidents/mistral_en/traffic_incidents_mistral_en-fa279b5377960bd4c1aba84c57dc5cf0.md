On the evening of December 25th, 2023, a traffic incident occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Linnankatu in Pelkosenniemi.

Upon arrival, paramedics assessed all parties involved in the incident. Mr. Saarinen and his passenger, Ms. Anna Lehto (42), were uninjured but shaken. Ms. M채ki and her passenger, Mr. Petri Koskela (35), sustained minor injuries and were transported to the local hospital for further evaluation and treatment.

The Volkswagen Golf sustained significant front-end damage, with the bumper and grille severely deformed. The Toyota Corolla Hybrid also suffered front-end damage, including a cracked windshield and damaged headlights.

The incident is currently under investigation by local authorities. Charges are pending against Mr. Saarinen for disregarding a traffic signal, which is believed to have caused the collision.
