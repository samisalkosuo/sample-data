 Title: Traffic Incident Report
Date: 15.03.2024
Location: Kärkölä, Finland
Incident Number: 2024-KL-0006

On the morning of March 15th, 2024, at approximately 8:37 AM local time, a traffic incident occurred on Miettiselänkatu (Miettisela Street), near the intersection with Kylpyläntie (Bathing Lane). The incident involved two vehicles: a silver Volvo XC60 (license plate F-XYZ 123) driven by Mr. Jukka Saarinen, aged 45, and a red Toyota Corolla (license plate O-PQR 987) driven by Ms. Liisa Mäki, aged 38.

According to eyewitness accounts, both vehicles were traveling in the same direction on Miettiselänkatu when the incident occurred. Mr. Saarinen was approaching the intersection at a speed estimated between 60-70 km/h, while Ms. Mäki was driving slightly slower due to the traffic lights being red.

As Mr. Saarinen approached the intersection, he failed to notice that Ms. Mäki had started moving forward after the lights turned green. In an attempt to overtake a slow-moving vehicle in front of him, Mr. Saarinen's Volvo collided with the rear end of Ms. Mäki's Corolla. The impact caused both vehicles to spin out of control and come to a stop on the opposite side of the road.

The weather conditions at the time were clear and sunny, providing good visibility for all parties involved. However, the road surface was slightly wet due to dew, which may have contributed to the loss of traction experienced by both drivers.

Upon arrival, emergency services found no injuries reported among the four occupants (Mr. Saarinen, Ms. Mäki, and their respective passengers). Both vehicles sustained significant damage to the rear ends and were towed away from the scene.

The incident caused minor traffic disruptions for approximately 45 minutes while the police conducted an initial investigation and cleared the debris. The road was reopened by 9:22 AM, and no further incidents were reported in the area during that morning.

This report is preliminary and subject to further investigation. Additional interviews with witnesses and a thorough examination of the vehicles will be conducted to determine the exact cause of the incident.
