On the day of June 3rd, 2024, at approximately 14:37 hours, a multiple vehicle collision occurred on Kauppakatu (Shopping Street) near the intersection with Linnankatu (Castle Street), in the heart of Hyrynsalmi. The incident involved three vehicles and resulted in minor injuries to several individuals.

The following is a detailed account of the events leading up to the collision:

14:35 hours - A white Volvo XC90, driven by Mr. Juhani Lehto (62), with two passengers on board, was traveling southbound on Kauppakatu. The vehicle's license plate read FIN-ABC 123.

14:36 hours - A black Mercedes E-Class, driven by Ms. Sanna Mäki (35), with one passenger, was approaching the same intersection from Linnankatu, heading eastbound. The vehicle's license plate read FIN-DEF 456.

14:37 hours - As both vehicles approached the intersection, a red Toyota Corolla, driven by Mr. Marko Saari (28), with no passengers, was traveling northbound on Kauppakatu and failed to stop at the red traffic light. The vehicle's license plate read FIN-GHI 789.

Upon failing to stop, the Toyota Corolla collided with the Mercedes E-Class, causing it to spin out of control and into the path of the oncoming Volvo XC90. The impact between the two vehicles forced the Volvo to veer off the road and strike a snowbank on the east side of Kauppakatu.

Witnesses at the scene reported that the snowy conditions had made it difficult for drivers to maintain control, with several slips and slides being observed prior to the collision. Mr. Lehto and his passengers were shaken but uninjured, while Ms. Mäki sustained minor injuries and was transported to Hyrynsalmi Hospital for treatment. No serious injuries were reported.

The road was closed for approximately two hours while emergency services attended to the scene and cleared debris. The vehicles involved in the collision were towed away, with extensive damage to all three vehicles.

This incident serves as a reminder to drivers to exercise caution, especially during adverse weather conditions. It is essential that drivers obey traffic laws and maintain a safe following distance to minimize the risk of collisions.
