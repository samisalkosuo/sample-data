Narrative:
On the morning of July 14, 2023, a traffic incident occurred at the intersection of Mäkelänkatu and Kauppakatu in Hyvinkää. The incident involved two vehicles: a silver 2018 Volvo XC60 with license plate FIN-ABC 123 and a black 2021 Toyota Corolla with license plate FIN-DEF 456.

According to eyewitness accounts, the incident began when the Volvo, driven by Mr. Juhani Mäkelä (age 45, resident of Mäkelänkatu 23), was approaching the intersection from Mäkelänkatu while the Toyota, driven by Ms. Sanna Kauppa (age 32, resident of Kauppakatu 17), was traveling south on Kauppakatu.

As both vehicles entered the intersection, a sudden thunderstorm hit the area, causing poor visibility and slippery road conditions. The Volvo, driven by Mr. Mäkelä, failed to stop at the red light due to the reduced visibility and hydroplaning on the wet roads. As a result, the Volvo collided with the Toyota, which was unable to avoid the impact due to the sudden appearance of the other vehicle in the intersection.

Immediately following the collision, both drivers exited their vehicles and checked on any passengers. Ms. Kauppa had a passenger, Mr. Marko Lehto (age 30), who sustained minor injuries but declined medical attention at the scene. Mr. Mäkelä was uninjured in the incident.
