On the day of July 3rd, 2023, at approximately 14:35 hours, a multiple vehicle collision occurred on Kylänkatu (Village Road) near the intersection with Mäkelänkuja (Makela Street), in Liperi, Finland. The incident involved five vehicles and resulted in minor injuries to several individuals.

The following is a detailed account of the events leading up to the collision:

14:30 hours - A white Volvo V60 with Finnish license plate FAB-123X, driven by Mr. Juhani Mäkelä (58), was traveling southbound on Kylänkatu at a speed estimated between 70 and 80 km/h.

14:32 hours - A red Toyota Corolla with Finnish license plate LUK-987Y, driven by Ms. Sanna Kylänen (35), was approaching the same intersection from Mäkelänkuja, intending to turn left onto Kylänkatu.

14:33 hours - As Mr. Mäkelä approached the intersection, he failed to notice that Ms. Kylänen had begun her left turn due to a temporary blind spot created by a large delivery truck parked on the southbound side of Kylänkatu.

14:34 hours - In an attempt to avoid the collision, Mr. Mäkelä swerved his Volvo towards the northbound lane, where he collided with a blue Ford Focus with Finnish license plate TAP-456R, driven by Mr. Teemu Tuominen (28).

14:35 hours - The impact of the initial collision caused both vehicles to spin out of control and cross back into the southbound lane, where they collided with a black Audi A4 with Finnish license plate LIN-789Z, driven by Ms. Liisa Kylä (42).

14:36 hours - The chain reaction continued as the Audi swerved and struck a green Volkswagen Golf with Finnish license plate HEL-345W, driven by Mr. Heikki Helmi (67), who was traveling northbound on Kylänkatu.

14:37 hours - Emergency services were notified immediately following the collision and arrived at the scene within 8 minutes. Witnesses reported that the windy conditions with gusts had made visibility difficult for drivers, contributing to the incident.

Upon arrival, all parties involved in the collision were assessed by medical personnel. Mr. Mäkelä, Ms. Kylänen, and Mr. Tuominen sustained minor injuries and were transported to Liperi Hospital for further evaluation and treatment. The other two drivers did not report any injuries.

The vehicles involved in the incident sustained significant damage, with the Volvo and Toyota requiring tow trucks for removal from the scene. The Audi and Volkswagen also suffered substantial damage but were able to be driven away under their own power after being inspected by a mechanic.

This report is based on eyewitness accounts, police investigation, and available evidence at the time of writing. Further analysis may be conducted as necessary to determine the exact cause of the collision and any potential contributing factors.
