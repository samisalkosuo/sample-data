Date: July 13, 2025
Location: Savukoski, Finland
Incident Number: 25-14678

On the day of July 13, 2025, at approximately 14:37 hours, a traffic incident occurred on Maaherrankatu (Highway Road), near the intersection with Kauppakatu (Shopping Street). The incident involved three vehicles and resulted in minor injuries to several individuals.

The following is a detailed account of the events leading up to the incident:

1. Vehicle 1 (2023 Tesla Model 3, license plate FIN-ABC 123) was traveling southbound on Maaherrankatu at a speed estimated between 60 and 70 km/h. The driver, Mr. Jari Kivinen (45 years old), had a clear view of the road due to the foggy conditions, which were not excessive at this time.

2. Approximately 100 meters north of the intersection with Kauppakatu, Vehicle 2 (2024 Toyota Corolla Hybrid, license plate FIN-DEF 456) was stationary on the side of the road due to a flat tire. The driver, Ms. Liisa Mäki (38 years old), had pulled over safely and was standing near her vehicle, attempting to change the tire with the assistance of a witness, Mr. Marko Saari (42 years old).

3. As Vehicle 1 approached the scene, it failed to slow down or swerve to avoid the stationary Vehicle 2. The driver, Mr. Kivinen, reported that he did not see Ms. Mäki or Mr. Saari due to the foggy conditions and the glare from the sun.

4. Upon impact, Vehicle 1 collided with the rear of Vehicle 2, causing it to spin out of control and strike a nearby street sign. The force of the collision caused Vehicle 1 to veer off the road and collide with a tree on the east side of Maaherrankatu.

5. Simultaneously, Vehicle 3 (2024 Ford Mustang Mach-E, license plate FIN-GHI 789) was traveling northbound on Maaherrankatu and was unable to avoid the chaotic scene due to the sudden stop of Vehicle 1. The driver, Mr. Petri Nurmi (35 years old), swerved to the right but still collided with the rear of Vehicle 2.

6. Following the initial impact, Ms. Mäki and Mr. Saari were able to move away from the vehicles unharmed. However, both Mr. Kivinen and Mr. Nurmi sustained minor injuries and were transported to Savukoski Hospital for treatment.

The incident caused significant traffic disruptions in the area, with emergency services arriving on scene within 10 minutes of the initial call. The road was closed for approximately two hours while the vehicles were removed and the scene was investigated.

Weather conditions at the time of the incident included foggy conditions with reduced visibility, as well as bright sunshine that may have contributed to glare for drivers. Road surfaces were wet but not icy or slippery.

This report is based on eyewitness accounts, physical evidence at the scene, and statements from the involved parties. The investigation is ongoing, and further details will be provided as they become available.
