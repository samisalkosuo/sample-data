Narrative:
On the evening of May 13, 2023, at approximately 19:37, a two-vehicle collision occurred on Kauppakatu (Shopping Street), near the intersection with Linnankatu (Castle Street). The incident involved a silver Volkswagen Golf, license plate FIN-ABC 123, driven by Mr. Jari M채ki (45 years old) and a black Toyota Corolla, license plate FIN-DEF 456, driven by Ms. Liisa Koskela (38 years old).

According to eyewitness accounts, both vehicles were traveling in the same direction on Kauppakatu when the incident occurred. Mr. M채ki, who was driving the Volkswagen Golf, reportedly lost control of his vehicle due to the slippery road conditions caused by the light rain. The Volkswagen skidded across the intersection and collided with Ms. Koskela's Toyota Corolla on the opposite lane.

Immediately following the collision, both drivers and their passengers exited their vehicles. Mr. M채ki and his passenger, a 12-year-old boy named Mikko, were unharmed.
