 **Traffic Incident Report**

Date: February 16, 2023
Location: Askola, Finland
Incident Number: TI-230216-001

On the day of February 16, 2023, at approximately 14:37 hours, a multi-vehicle collision occurred on Vuoksi Street (State Road 5) near the intersection with Kymijoki Avenue (County Road 61). The incident involved three vehicles and resulted in minor injuries to several individuals.

The following is a detailed account of the events leading up to the accident:

Vehicle 1, a silver Volvo V60 with license plate F-ASKOA 123, was traveling southbound on Vuoksi Street at an estimated speed of 70 km/h. The driver, Mr. Jari Mäki (45), and his passenger, Mrs. Sanna Mäki (42), were en route to their residence located at Kauppakatu 12, Askola.

Approaching the intersection with Kymijoki Avenue, Mr. Mäki failed to notice a red light due to the windy conditions and gusts that obscured his view. As a result, he proceeded into the intersection, colliding with Vehicle 2, a black Audi Q5 with license plate F-ASKOA 456, which was traveling eastbound on Kymijoki Avenue.

Vehicle 2, driven by Ms. Liisa Koskela (38), and her passenger, Mr. Eero Koskela (7), were on their way to the local library located at Linnankatu 34, Askola. Upon impact, both vehicles sustained significant damage to their front ends, with Vehicle 1 also spinning out of control and colliding with a stationary vehicle parked on the southbound side of Vuoksi Street.

The third vehicle involved in the incident was a blue Toyota Corolla with license plate F-ASKOA 789, which was parked legally on the southbound side of Vuoksi Street. The impact caused minor damage to the driver's side door and mirror of the Toyota. The driver, Mr. Markku Lehto (52), was unharmed but visibly shaken by the incident.

Witnesses at the scene reported that the windy conditions had made it difficult for drivers to maintain control of their vehicles, with several other near-misses occurring in the minutes leading up to the accident. One witness, Mr. Juhani Hämäläinen (65), a local resident, stated that he had seen Mr. Mäki's Volvo approaching the intersection at high speed and failing to slow down despite the red light and adverse weather conditions.

Emergency services were promptly dispatched to the scene, with police officers, firefighters, and paramedics arriving within 10 minutes of the initial call. The injured parties were treated on-site before being transported to Askola Hospital for further evaluation and treatment.

The road was closed for approximately two hours while the incident was investigated and cleared. Traffic control measures were put in place to divert vehicles away from the affected area during this time.

This report is preliminary in nature and subject to further investigation by the local police department. The cause of the accident is believed to be due to the driver's failure to obey a traffic signal, exacerbated by adverse weather conditions. Charges may be filed against Mr. Jari Mäki pending the completion of the investigation.
