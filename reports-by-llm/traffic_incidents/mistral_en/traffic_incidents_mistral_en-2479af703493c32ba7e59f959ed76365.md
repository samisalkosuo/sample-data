 Title: Traffic Incident Report - 24.11.2024, Karvia, Finland

On the morning of November 24th, 2024, at approximately 8:37 AM local time, a multi-vehicle collision occurred on Kauppakatu (Shopping Street), near the intersection with Linnankatu (Castle Street) in the municipality of Karvia, Finland.

The incident involved nine vehicles, as follows:

1. Vehicle 1 - A silver Toyota Corolla (license plate F-ABC 123) driven by Mr. Juhani Särkijärvi, aged 45, traveling southbound on Kauppakatu.
2. Vehicle 2 - A black Volkswagen Golf (license plate X-DEF 456) driven by Ms. Liisa Mäkelä, aged 38, also traveling southbound on Kauppakatu, immediately behind Mr. Särkijärvi's vehicle.
3. Vehicle 3 - A red Ford Fiesta (license plate G-HIJ 789) driven by Mr. Markku Lappalainen, aged 52, traveling northbound on Kauppakatu, approaching the intersection with Linnankatu.
4. Vehicles 4 through 8 - Four additional vehicles involved in subsequent collisions due to the initial impact, including a blue Peugeot 3008 (license plate J-KLM 901), a green Honda Civic (license plate P-NOP 234), a white Opel Astra (license plate Q-RST 567), and two unidentified vehicles due to extensive damage.
5. Vehicle 9 - A black Mercedes-Benz E-Class (license plate Z-UVW 321) driven by Mr. Petri Koskela, aged 48, who was a witness to the accident but did not collide with any other vehicles.

According to eyewitness accounts and the investigation conducted at the scene, Mr. Särkijärvi's vehicle lost control due to icy road conditions, causing it to slide sideways into the northbound lane of Kauppakatu. Ms. Mäkelä was unable to stop in time and collided with Mr. Särkijärvi's vehicle from behind. The impact caused both vehicles to spin out of control, blocking the southbound lanes of Kauppakatu.

Mr. Lappalainen, traveling northbound on Kauppakatu, was unable to avoid the collision and crashed into the rear of Ms. Mäkelä's vehicle. The subsequent impact caused a chain reaction involving four additional vehicles, which collided with each other and the initial two vehicles.

The incident resulted in extensive damage to all vehicles involved, as well as minor injuries to several passengers. Emergency services were promptly dispatched to the scene, and traffic was diverted to minimize further disruptions. The road was reopened by 10:45 AM after the vehicles were towed away and the debris cleared.

The investigation is ongoing to determine the exact cause of the initial collision and any contributing factors. Icy road conditions are believed to have played a significant role in the incident, as reported by witnesses and confirmed by the condition of the road at the time of the accident.

This report will be updated as more information becomes available.
