Date: 06.03.2024
Location: Evijärvi, Finland
Incident Number: EJR-240306-001

On the night of March 6th, 2024, at approximately 23:37 hours, a traffic incident occurred on Kauppakatu (Shopping Street) near the intersection with Miettisalmentie (Mietti Farm Road). The incident involved two vehicles: a silver 2019 Volvo XC60 with license plate FIN-ABC 123 and a black 2020 Toyota Corolla with license plate FIN-DEF 456.

Witnesses at the scene reported that the Volvo, driven by Mr. Juhani Mäki (age 38, resident of Kauppakatu 12), was traveling southbound on Kauppakatu when it lost control due to wet and slippery road conditions. The vehicle veered off the road onto the grass median, before re-entering the roadway and colliding with the Toyota Corolla, driven by Ms. Liisa Koskela (age 42, resident of Miettisalmentie 37), who was traveling eastbound on Miettisalmentie.

Ms. Koskela attempted to slow down and avoid the collision but was unable to do so due to the sudden appearance of the Volvo in her path. The impact caused significant damage to both vehicles, with the Volvo sustaining front-end damage and the Corolla suffering rear-end damage.

Emergency services arrived at the scene within minutes, and both drivers were assessed for injuries. Mr. Mäki complained of neck pain but declined transport to the hospital. Ms. Koskela was transported to Evijärvi Hospital with complaints of chest pain and a possible concussion.

The road was closed for approximately two hours while the scene was cleared and investigated. The incident remains under investigation, and charges are pending further review of evidence and witness statements.

Weather conditions at the time of the incident were wet and slippery, with rain falling intermittently throughout the evening. Road surfaces were slick, and visibility was reduced due to the precipitation.
