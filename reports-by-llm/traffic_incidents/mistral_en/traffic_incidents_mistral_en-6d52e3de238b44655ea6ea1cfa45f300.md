 Title: Traffic Incident Report
Date: May 15, 2024
Location: Vieremä, Finland
Incident Number: 24-VIE-00378

On the night of May 15, 2024, at approximately 23:36 local time, a multiple-vehicle collision occurred on Kylänkatu (Farmers' Road), near the intersection with Metsäpolku (Forest Path). The incident involved three vehicles and resulted in minor injuries to several individuals.

The first vehicle involved was a 2018 Volvo XC90, driven by Mr. Juhani Lehto (35 years old) with his wife, Mrs. Sanna Lehto (32 years old), as a passenger. The Lehtos were traveling southbound on Kylänkatu when they approached the icy intersection with Metsäpolku.

Simultaneously, a 2017 Toyota Rav4, driven by Mr. Marko Mäki (42 years old) and carrying his daughter, Miss Emilia Mäki (8 years old), was traveling eastbound on Metsäpolku. Due to the icy road conditions, Mr. Mäki lost control of his vehicle as he entered the intersection, causing him to slide diagonally into the path of the oncoming Volvo XC90.

The third vehicle involved was a 2016 Ford Focus, driven by Miss Liisa Koskela (28 years old), who was traveling southbound behind the Volvo XC90. Upon seeing the collision unfold, Miss Koskela attempted to swerve to avoid the accident but was unable to do so, striking the rear of Mr. Mäki's Toyota Rav4.

Upon arrival at the scene, emergency services found all parties involved to be conscious and responsive. Mr. Lehto and his wife sustained minor injuries, while Miss Emilia Mäki and Miss Koskela were unharmed. Mr. Mäki was transported to Vieremän Hospital for further evaluation due to complaints of neck pain.

The vehicles involved in the collision sustained significant damage. The Volvo XC90's front bumper and grille were crushed, while the Toyota Rav4's front end was severely damaged, with the airbags deploying upon impact. The Ford Focus suffered minor rear-end damage.

The road was closed for approximately two hours to allow for the removal of the vehicles and debris, as well as for the investigation into the cause of the accident. The icy conditions on Kylänkatu were deemed a contributing factor in the incident.

This report will be forwarded to the appropriate authorities for further review and potential action regarding road maintenance and safety measures.
