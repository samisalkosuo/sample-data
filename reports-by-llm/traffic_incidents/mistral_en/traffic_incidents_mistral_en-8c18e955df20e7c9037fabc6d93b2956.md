Incident Number: 23-00456
Time of Occurrence: 14:37 (day)
Weather Conditions: Light rain

Upon arrival at the scene on Mäkelänkatu (Mäkelin Street), near the intersection with Kauppakatu (Shopping Street), I found three vehicles involved in a collision. The incident occurred between a silver Volvo V60 with license plate F-XYZ 123, driven by Mr. Juhani Mäkelä (age 45, resident of Mäkelänkatu 23), a black Mercedes C-Class with license plate O-ABC 987, driven by Ms. Liisa Kauppa (age 38, resident of Kauppakatu 17), and a red Toyota Corolla with license plate P-DEF 456, driven by Mr. Antti Pentti (age 28, resident of Penttintie 3).

According to eyewitness accounts, the incident began when Mr. Mäkelä failed to stop at a red light at the intersection and collided with Ms. Kauppa's Mercedes, which was traveling straight ahead. The impact caused Ms. Kauppa's vehicle to spin out of control and collide with Mr. Pentti's Toyota Corolla, which was parked on the side of the road waiting for a green light.

Upon further investigation, it appears that Mr. Mäkelä may have been distracted by his mobile phone at the time of the incident. He has admitted to looking at a map application and not paying attention to the road. Ms. Kauppa and Mr. Pentti both reported no injuries, but all three vehicles sustained significant damage.

The light rain falling during the incident made it difficult for drivers to see clearly, and the slick roads may have contributed to the collision. Road conditions were otherwise normal, with no construction or other obstacles present at the time of the incident.

This report will be forwarded to the appropriate authorities for further investigation and potential charges against Mr. Mäkelä for reckless driving. All parties involved in the incident were cooperative and provided statements. The scene was cleared by 15:45, and traffic returned to normal.
