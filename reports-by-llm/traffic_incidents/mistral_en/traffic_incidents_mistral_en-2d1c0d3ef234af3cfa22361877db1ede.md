Date: 26.04.2025
Location: Siuntio, Finland
Incident Number: SIU-25-1378

On the day of April 26th, 2025, at approximately 14:37 hours, a traffic incident occurred on Mäkelänkatu (Mäkelä Street), near the intersection with Kylpyläntie (Bathing Lane). The incident involved two vehicles, resulting in minor injuries and significant traffic disruption.

The first vehicle involved was a 2023 Volvo XC60 (license plate F-XYZ123) driven by Mr. Juhani Kivinen, aged 45, of Mäkelänkatu 27, Siuntio. Witness statements indicate that Mr. Kivinen was traveling southbound on Mäkelänkatu at a speed estimated to be within the posted 60 km/h limit.

The second vehicle involved was a 2024 Toyota Corolla (license plate O-ABC987) driven by Ms. Sanna Saarinen, aged 32, of Kylpyläntie 15, Siuntio. Ms. Saarinen was turning left from Kylpyläntie onto Mäkelänkatu when the incident occurred.

According to eyewitness accounts, the foggy conditions had significantly reduced visibility on the road, making it difficult for drivers to navigate the intersection. As Mr. Kivini's Volvo approached the intersection, he was unable to stop in time due to the poor visibility and collided with Ms. Saarinen's Toyota Corolla.

The impact caused both vehicles to spin out of control, blocking the southbound lanes of Mäkelänkatu. The airbags deployed in both vehicles, and emergency services were immediately dispatched to the scene.

Upon arrival, paramedics assessed the injuries sustained by Mr. Kivini and Ms. Saarinen. Both individuals reported minor neck and back pain but declined transport to the hospital. They were advised to seek medical attention if their symptoms worsened.

The traffic disruption caused by the incident resulted in significant delays for motorists in both directions on Mäkelänkatu. The southbound lanes remained closed for approximately two hours while the vehicles were towed and the scene was cleared.

This report is based on eyewitness accounts, police investigation, and the statements of Mr. Kivini and Ms. Saarinen. The incident remains under investigation, with a focus on determining whether any traffic laws were violated and assessing the impact of foggy weather conditions on the accident.
