Location: Taivalkoski, Finland
Incident Number: TAIV-23456789

On the day of April 7th, 2025, at approximately 14:37 hours, a traffic incident occurred on Kauppakatu (Shopping Street) near the intersection with Linnankatu (Castle Street), in Taivalkoski. The incident involved two vehicles: a silver Volkswagen Golf TSI bearing Finnish license plate FAB-123M and a black Toyota Corolla Hybrid with the license plate HYD-456N.

Witnesses at the scene reported that the Volkswagen, driven by Mr. Jukka Mäki (age 38, resident of Kauppakatu 21) was traveling southbound on Kauppakatu, while the Toyota, driven by Ms. Liisa Koskela (age 45, resident of Linnankatu 37), was turning left from Linnankatu onto Kauppakatu.

According to eyewitness accounts, Mr. Mäki's vehicle approached the intersection at a high speed, and Ms. Koskela began her turn as Mr. Mäki's car was approximately 50 meters away. The windy conditions with gusts caused Mr. Mäki's vehicle to swerve slightly, colliding with the passenger side of Ms. Koskela's Toyota Corolla.

Upon impact, both vehicles sustained significant damage. The Volkswagen's front-end was severely crumpled, while the Toyota's passenger side door and fender were dented and scratched. Both drivers remained in their vehicles following the collision, with Mr. Mäki appearing shaken but otherwise uninjured. Ms. Koskela reported minor injuries to her left arm and was transported to Taivalkoski Hospital for further evaluation.

The road conditions at the time of the incident were slippery due to the windy weather, which may have contributed to Mr. Mäki's loss of control. The Finnish Weather Service reported gusts of up to 30 km/h during the day on April 7th, 2025.

The incident caused a temporary blockage of traffic in both directions on Kauppakatu and resulted in delays for approximately one hour while emergency services attended to the scene and cleared the vehicles. The Taivalkoski Police Department is currently investigating the incident and will determine any potential charges based on the findings of the investigation.

This report has been compiled using information gathered from eyewitnesses, the involved parties, and relevant traffic camera footage. Further updates will be provided as the investigation progresses.
