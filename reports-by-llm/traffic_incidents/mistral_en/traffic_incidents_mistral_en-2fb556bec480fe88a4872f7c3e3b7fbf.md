 Title: Traffic Incident Report - 25.10.2024, Hirvensalmi, Finland

On the evening of October 25th, 2024, at approximately 19:37 hours, an unfortunate multi-vehicle collision occurred on Kauppakatu (Shopping Street) in Hirvensalmi, Finland. The incident involved eleven vehicles, resulting in property damage and minor injuries to several individuals.

The sequence of events began when a southbound Toyota RAV4, driven by Mr. Jari Mäki (license plate F-XYZ 123), lost control due to wet and slippery road conditions as he approached the intersection with Linnankatu (Castle Street). Witness statements suggest that Mr. Mäki attempted to apply his brakes but was unable to prevent the vehicle from skidding into the intersection.

As a result, Mr. Mäki's Toyota collided with a northbound Volkswagen Golf driven by Ms. Liisa Koskela (license plate O-ABC 456), who was unable to avoid the accident due to the sudden appearance of the out-of-control vehicle. The impact caused both vehicles to spin out of control, blocking the intersection and causing a chain reaction involving nine additional vehicles.

The following vehicles were involved in the collision:
1. Toyota RAV4 (F-XYZ 123) - Jari Mäki (driver) and his wife, Sari Mäki (passenger) sustained minor injuries.
2. Volkswagen Golf (O-ABC 456) - Liisa Koskela (driver) and her son, Eero Koskela (passenger), were unharmed but shaken by the incident.
