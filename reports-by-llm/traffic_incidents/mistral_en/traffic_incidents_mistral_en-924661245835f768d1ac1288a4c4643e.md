Date: 01.07.2025
Location: Hausjärvi, Finland
Incident Number: TI-2025-HJ-0034

On the day of July 1st, 2025, at approximately 14:37 hours, a traffic incident occurred on Kauppakatu (Shopping Street) near the intersection with Mannerheimintie (Mannerheim Avenue), in the heart of Hausjärvi. The incident involved two vehicles: a silver Toyota Corolla (license plate F-ABC 123) driven by Mr. Jari Saarinen, aged 45, and a black Volkswagen Golf (license plate X-DEF 456) driven by Ms. Liisa Mäki, aged 38.

According to eyewitness accounts, both vehicles were traveling in the same direction on Kauppakatu when the incident occurred. Mr. Saarinen was reportedly driving at an excessive speed, estimated around 70 km/h in a 50 km/h zone. Ms. Mäki, who was driving her Volkswagen Golf, was maintaining the speed limit.

As Mr. Saarinen approached the intersection with Mannerheimintie, he failed to stop at the red light and collided with Ms. Mäki's vehicle on the opposite lane. The impact caused both vehicles to spin out of control, blocking the intersection for approximately 30 minutes until emergency services arrived.

The weather conditions at the time were dry but cold, with temperatures hovering around 12°C (54°F). The road surface was wet due to dew, which may have contributed to Mr. Saarinen's inability to stop in time.

Upon arrival, emergency services found both drivers and passengers unharmed but shaken. Mr. Saarinen was issued a citation for reckless driving, while no charges were filed against Ms. Mäki. The vehicles sustained significant damage, with the Toyota Corolla's front end crumpled and the Volkswagen Golf's passenger side dented.

This incident serves as a reminder to all drivers to adhere to speed limits and traffic regulations for the safety of themselves and others on the road.
