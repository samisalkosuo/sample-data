 **Traffic Incident Report**

Date: August 16, 2023
Location: Tuusula, Finland
Incident Number: TU-230816-001

On the day of August 16, 2023, at approximately 14:37 hours, a traffic incident occurred on Mäkelänkatu, a major road in the municipality of Tuusula. The incident involved two vehicles: a silver Volvo XC90 (license plate F-XYZ 123) driven by Mr. Jari Kivinen, aged 45, and a red Toyota Corolla (license plate O-ABC 456) driven by Ms. Liisa Mäkelä, aged 38.

According to eyewitness accounts, both vehicles were traveling in the same direction on Mäkelänkatu when the incident occurred near the intersection with Kaukokoskenkatu. The clear and sunny weather conditions provided good visibility, but the road surface was slightly wet due to a recent rain shower that had passed through the area earlier in the day.

Mr. Kivinen, who was driving the Volvo XC90, reported that he was approaching the intersection at a speed of approximately 60 km/h when he noticed the red Toyota Corolla ahead of him suddenly slow down and swerve to the right. In an attempt to avoid a collision, Mr. Kivinen applied his brakes but was unable to stop in time. The front of the Volvo collided with the rear driver's side of the Toyota, causing both vehicles to spin out of control before coming to a halt on the opposite side of the road.

Ms. Mäkelä, who was driving the Toyota Corolla, stated that she had been adjusting her radio when she suddenly heard a loud noise and felt her vehicle being struck from behind. She lost control of the car and swerved off the road. Ms. Mäkelä and her passenger, Mr. Marko Hämäläinen (aged 42), both sustained minor injuries and were transported to Tuusula Hospital for treatment.

Witnesses at the scene reported that they had seen Mr. Kivinen's Volvo swerving erratically before the collision, but it is unclear what may have caused this behavior. The police are investigating whether Mr. Kivinen was under the influence of alcohol or drugs at the time of the incident.

The road was closed for approximately two hours while emergency services attended to the scene and cleared debris. Both vehicles sustained significant damage, with the Volvo's front end crumpled and the Toyota's rear driver's side heavily damaged.

This report is preliminary in nature and will be updated as more information becomes available. The police are urging anyone who may have witnessed the incident or has relevant information to contact the Tuusula Police Department at (09) 876-1234.
