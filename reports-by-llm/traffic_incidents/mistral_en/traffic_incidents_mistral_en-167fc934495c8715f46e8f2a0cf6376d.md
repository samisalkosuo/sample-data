 **Traffic Incident Report**

Date: 14.02.2023
Location: Lemland, Finland
Incident Number: LEM-230214-001
Time of Incident: 08:37 (Morning)
Weather Conditions: Windy with gusts

Upon arrival at the scene on Kustavi Road (Borgåvägen), near the intersection with Västerbyvägen, I found two vehicles involved in a collision. The incident occurred between a silver Volvo XC60 (license plate FIN-ABC 123) driven by Mr. Juhani Mäki (age 45, resident of Kustavi Road 22) and a black Mercedes C-Class (license plate FIN-DEF 456) driven by Ms. Sanna Virtanen (age 32, resident of Västerbyvägen 17).

According to eyewitness accounts, both drivers were traveling in opposite directions when the incident occurred. Mr. Mäki was approaching the intersection from Kustavi Road while Ms. Virtanen was coming from Västerbyvägen. The windy conditions caused Mr. Mäki's vehicle to drift into oncoming traffic, colliding with Ms. Virtanen's Mercedes.

The impact caused significant damage to both vehicles. Mr. Mäki's Volvo sustained front-end damage, while Ms. Virtanen's Mercedes had rear-end damage. Both drivers and passengers (Ms. Mäki, age 42, and Mr. Virtanen, age 7) were wearing seatbelts and did not sustain any serious injuries.

The road was wet due to the morning dew, and the windy conditions made it difficult for drivers to maintain control of their vehicles. The incident caused a traffic jam lasting approximately 30 minutes while the scene was cleared and the vehicles were towed away.

This report will be forwarded to the relevant authorities for further investigation. Relevant parties have been contacted, and statements have been taken from both drivers and eyewitnesses.
