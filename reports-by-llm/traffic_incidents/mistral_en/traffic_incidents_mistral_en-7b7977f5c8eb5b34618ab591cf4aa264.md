 Title: Traffic Incident Report
Date: 30th December 2022
Location: Merikarvia, Finland
Incident Number: TI-221230-001

On the morning of December 30, 2022, at approximately 8:45 AM, a traffic incident occurred on Kauppakatu (Shopping Street) near the intersection with Linnankatu (Castle Street), in Merikarvia. The incident involved two vehicles: a silver Volvo V60 with license plate F-XYZ123, driven by Mr. Juhani Sorsa, and a black Toyota Corolla with license plate O-ABC456, driven by Ms. Liisa Mäki.

Mr. Sorsa, 45, was traveling southbound on Kauppakatu while Ms. Mäki, 38, was approaching the intersection from Linnankatu, intending to turn left onto Kauppakatu. The weather conditions were snowy, with a light but steady snowfall and reduced visibility. The roads were slick due to the accumulated snow, making driving conditions challenging.

According to eyewitness accounts, Mr. Sorsa failed to notice Ms. Mäki's turning signal and continued at a speed of approximately 50 km/h in the intersection. Ms. Mäki began her turn, but due to the slippery road conditions, her vehicle lost traction and slid into the path of Mr. Sorsa's oncoming Volvo.

The impact occurred near the address Kauppakatu 23, causing both vehicles to spin out of control. The Volvo sustained significant front-end damage, while the Toyota Corolla suffered damage to its passenger side and undercarriage. No other vehicles were involved in the incident.

Both drivers and their passengers—Ms. Sorsa's 10-year-old daughter and Mr. Mäki's 8-year-old son—were uninjured, but shaken by the event. Emergency services arrived at the scene promptly and ensured that all parties were safe and provided with necessary assistance.

The incident caused a temporary traffic disruption in the area, as the police directed traffic around the accident site while the vehicles were towed away. The road was cleared and reopened by 10:30 AM.

This report is being submitted for the official record and further investigation into the cause of the accident will be conducted by the Merikarvia Traffic Department. Recommendations for improved signage, visibility, or traffic control measures in the area may be considered based on the findings of this investigation.
