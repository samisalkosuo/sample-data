**Narrative:**

On the afternoon of February 27, 2024, a traffic incident occurred on Vuorimiehenkatu (Warrior's Man Road), Eckerö, Finland. The incident involved two vehicles: a silver 2019 Volvo XC60 with license plate F-XYZ 123 and a black 2022 Toyota Corolla with license plate O-ABC 456.

According to eyewitness accounts, the incident began when the Volvo, driven by Mr. Juhani Lehto (age 45, resident of Vuorimiehenkatu 12), was traveling southbound on Vuorimiehenkatu at a speed estimated between 60-70 km/h. Simultaneously, the Toyota Corolla, driven by Ms. Sanna Mäki (age 34, resident of Kauppakatu 5), was approaching from the opposite direction on the same road.

As both vehicles approached a bend in the road, the heavy rain and strong winds caused reduced visibility and slippery conditions. The Volvo, driven by Mr. Lehto, lost control due to the adverse weather conditions and hydroplaning on the wet road surface. The vehicle skidded sideways into the northbound lane, directly into the path of the oncoming Toyota Corolla.

Ms. Mäki, who was unable to avoid the collision due to the poor visibility and slippery road conditions, collided with the Volvo's driver's side at high speed. The impact caused both vehicles to spin out of control before coming to a halt on the opposite sides of the road.
