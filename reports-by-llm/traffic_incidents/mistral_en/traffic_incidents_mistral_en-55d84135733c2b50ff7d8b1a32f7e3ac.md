 Title: Traffic Incident Report
Date: 08.02.2023
Location: Hattula, Finland
Incident Number: 23-0145

On the morning of February 8th, 2023, at approximately 07:45, a multi-vehicle collision occurred on Kauppakatu (Shopping Street) near the intersection with Mannerheimintie (Mannerheim Road), in Hattula. The incident involved five vehicles and resulted in minor injuries to several individuals.

The following is a detailed account of the events leading up to the accident:

1. Vehicle 1 (2022 Toyota Corolla, license plate F-ABC 123) was traveling southbound on Kauppakatu, driven by Mr. Jari Mäki (45 years old).

2. Vehicle 2 (2018 Volkswagen Golf, license plate X-DEF 456), driven by Ms. Liisa Koskinen (32 years old), was also moving southbound on Kauppakatu, immediately behind Mr. Mäki's vehicle.

3. Vehicle 3 (2019 Ford Focus, license plate G-HIJ 789) was stationary at a red light facing northbound on Mannerheimintie, driven by Mr. Markku Saarinen (58 years old).

4. Vehicle 4 (2020 Hyundai Tucson, license plate J-KLM 901), driven by Ms. Anna Lehto (37 years old), was also waiting at the same red light.

5. Vehicle 5 (2016 Mercedes-Benz C-Class, license plate P-QRS 567) was traveling northbound on Mannerheimintie, driven by Mr. Petri Nurmi (42 years old).

As the traffic lights turned green for southbound vehicles on Kauppakatu, Mr. Mäki's Toyota Corolla began to move forward. However, due to poor visibility caused by heavy snowfall, he failed to notice that Ms. Koskinen's Volkswagen Golf was following too closely behind him.

Ms. Koskinen, who was distracted by her mobile phone, did not react in time and collided with the rear of Mr. Mäki's vehicle. The impact caused both vehicles to spin out of control, blocking the southbound lanes on Kauppakatu.

Meanwhile, as the traffic lights turned green for northbound vehicles on Mannerheimintie, Mr. Saarinen began to move forward in his Ford Focus. Unable to see the blocked lanes on Kauppakatu due to the heavy snowfall and poor visibility, he collided with the rear of Ms. Lehto's stationary Hyundai Tucson.

The impact from Mr. Saarinen's vehicle caused Ms. Lehto's vehicle to move forward and collide with the rear of Mr. Nurmi's Mercedes-Benz C-Class, which was still moving northbound on Mannerheimintie.

Upon impact, both Ms. Koskinen and Mr. Saarinen sustained minor injuries and were transported to Hattula Hospital for treatment. No other passengers or bystanders were reported injured in the incident.

The road was closed for approximately two hours while emergency services attended to the scene and cleared the debris. The snowy conditions made it difficult to assess the full extent of the damage to each vehicle, but it is estimated that all five vehicles sustained significant damage as a result of the collision.

Witness statements suggest that Mr. Mäki and Ms. Koskinen were both using their mobile phones at the time of the incident, which may have contributed to their failure to react appropriately. Police are currently investigating this possibility further.

This report is preliminary in nature and will be updated as more information becomes available.
