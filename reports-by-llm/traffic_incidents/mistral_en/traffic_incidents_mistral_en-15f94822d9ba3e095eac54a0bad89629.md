 Title: Traffic Incident Report
Date: 02.11.2023
Location: Rauma, Finland
Incident Number: RA-231102-001

On the night of November 2nd, 2023, a traffic incident occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Torikatu in the heart of Rauma. The incident involved two vehicles: a silver Volvo V60 with license plate FIN-ABC 123 and a black Volkswagen Golf with license plate FIN-DEF 456.

At approximately 23:37, eyewitness accounts suggest that the Volvo, driven by Mr. Juhani M채ki (age 42, resident of Kauppakatu 12), was traveling south on Kauppakatu while the Volkswagen, driven by Ms. Sanna Koskela (age 35, resident of Torikatu 45), was moving west on Torikatu.

As both vehicles approached the intersection, a sudden gust of wind caused Mr. M채ki to lose control of his vehicle, causing it to veer off its intended path and collide with Ms. Koskela's Volkswagen. The impact sent the Volkswagen spinning into a nearby parking lot, while the Volvo came to a halt on the intersection.

Upon arrival at the scene, emergency services found both drivers uninjured but shaken. Mr. M채ki and Ms. Koskela were cooperative and provided statements detailing the incident. Witnesses corroborated their accounts, stating that the windy conditions had significantly impacted visibility and control for both drivers.

The Volvo sustained significant front-end damage, with the bumper and grille severely damaged. The Volkswagen's passenger side was dented and scratched from the collision. Both vehicles were towed away from the scene for further inspection and repairs.

Road conditions at the time of the incident were slippery due to the windy weather, which may have contributed to Mr. M채ki losing control of his vehicle. The intersection was closed for approximately one hour while emergency services attended to the scene and cleared debris.

This report is preliminary in nature and subject to further investigation by the Rauma Police Department's Traffic Unit. No charges have been filed at this time, but both drivers are being advised to exercise caution when driving in adverse weather conditions.
