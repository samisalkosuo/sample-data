 Title: Traffic Incident Report
Date: May 19, 2025
Location: Puumala, Finland
Incident Number: 2025-PUM-0034

On the morning of May 19, 2025, at approximately 8:37 AM local time, a traffic incident occurred on Kauppakatu (Shopping Street) near the intersection with Miettisalmentie (Mietti Farm Road). The incident involved two vehicles: a silver Toyota Corolla (license plate F-ABC 123) driven by Mr. Jari Saarinen, aged 45, and a red Volkswagen Golf (license plate X-DEF 456) driven by Ms. Liisa Mäki, aged 38.

According to eyewitness accounts, both vehicles were traveling in the same direction on Kauppakatu when the incident occurred. Mr. Saarinen was approaching the intersection from Miettisalmentie, while Ms. Mäki was approximately 50 meters ahead, stopped at a red traffic light.

As Mr. Saarinen approached the intersection, he failed to notice that the traffic light had turned yellow and subsequently red. In an attempt to beat the red light, he accelerated, losing control of his vehicle due to the wet road conditions caused by light rain. The Toyota Corolla skidded sideways across Kauppakatu, colliding with Ms. Mäki's stationary Volkswagen Golf on the driver's side.

The impact caused significant damage to both vehicles. The front passenger side of the Toyota Corolla was severely crumpled, while the Volkswagen Golf sustained damage to its driver's door and front fender. Both drivers managed to exit their vehicles with assistance from bystanders. Neither driver nor any passengers were seriously injured; however, both parties complained of minor whiplash and were transported to Puumala Hospital for further examination.

The incident caused a temporary blockage of traffic on Kauppakatu, with emergency services arriving at the scene within 5 minutes. The road was cleared by 9:12 AM, and traffic returned to normal.

This report is based on eyewitness accounts, police investigation, and statements from both drivers involved in the incident. The cause of the accident appears to be due to Mr. Saarinen's failure to adhere to the traffic light signals and his subsequent loss of control due to wet road conditions. Further investigation will determine if any charges are warranted.
