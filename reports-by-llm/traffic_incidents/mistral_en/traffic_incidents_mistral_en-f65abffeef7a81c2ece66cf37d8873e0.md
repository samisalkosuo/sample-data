 Title: Traffic Incident Report
Date: December 30, 2024
Location: Helsinki, Finland
Incident Number: 241230-1234

On the day of December 30, 2024, at approximately 15:37 hours, a traffic incident occurred on Mannerheimintie, one of Helsinki's major thoroughfares. The incident involved two vehicles: a silver Volvo XC90 (license plate F-ABC 123) driven by Mr. Juhani Särkijärvi and a black Audi Q7 (license plate O-DEF 456) driven by Ms. Liisa Koskinen.

According to eyewitness accounts, both vehicles were traveling in the same direction when the incident occurred near the intersection with Fabianinkatu. Mr. Särkijärvi, who was driving the Volvo, reported that he had slowed down due to heavy traffic and was preparing to turn left onto Fabianinkatu. Ms. Koskinen, in the Audi, failed to notice the stopped traffic ahead and rear-ended the Volvo.

The weather conditions at the time were dry but cold, with temperatures hovering around -5°C. The road surface was icy, which may have contributed to the incident as both drivers reported difficulty maintaining control of their vehicles.

Upon arrival, emergency services found that both vehicles sustained significant damage. The Volvo's front bumper and grille were crushed, while the Audi's front end was severely damaged. Both drivers and passengers—Ms. Koskinen had a passenger named Mr. Petri Mäkelä in her car—were uninjured but shaken up by the incident.

Witnesses at the scene provided statements corroborating the accounts of the drivers. A Ms. Sanna Lappalainen, who was waiting at a bus stop nearby, reported seeing the Audi approaching rapidly before the collision occurred. Another witness, Mr. Eero Saarinen, stated that he had seen Mr. Särkijärvi signal his intention to turn left but did not expect the sudden impact from behind.

The incident caused significant traffic congestion in the area for approximately one hour while emergency services attended to the scene and cleared debris. The vehicles were towed away by 16:08 hours, and both drivers were advised to have their vehicles inspected for any hidden damage. No charges were filed at the time of this report's writing, but the incident remains under investigation.
