 Title: Traffic Incident Report
Date: October 16, 2024
Location: Pori, Finland
Incident Number: 241016-003

On the day of October 16, 2024, at approximately 15:37 hours, a four-vehicle collision occurred on Mannerheimintie (State Road 8), near the intersection with Keskuskatu, in Pori. The incident involved the following vehicles and participants:

1. Vehicle A - A silver 2024 Volvo XC90 (license plate FIN-ABC 123) driven by Mr. Juhani Mäki (age 45, resident of Kauppakatu 45)
2. Vehicle B - A red 2022 Toyota Corolla (license plate FIN-DEF 456) driven by Ms. Sanna Koskela (age 32, resident of Linnankatu 78)
3. Vehicle C - A black 2019 Mercedes-Benz E-Class (license plate FIN-GHI 789) driven by Mr. Markku Saarinen (age 52, resident of Yliopistonkatu 21)
4. Vehicle D - A blue 2023 Ford Focus (license plate FIN-JKL 901) driven by Ms. Liisa Niemi (age 28, resident of Kauppakatu 67)

Witness statements indicate that the incident began when Mr. Mäki, driving Vehicle A, was traveling southbound on Mannerheimintie at a speed estimated to be above the posted limit of 50 km/h. Ms. Koskela, in Vehicle B, was turning left from Keskuskatu onto Mannerheimintie, also heading southbound.

As Ms. Koskela began her turn, she was struck by Mr. Mäki's vehicle, causing her to lose control and collide with the oncoming Vehicle C, driven by Mr. Saarinen. The impact of this collision forced Vehicle C into the northbound lanes, where it was subsequently hit by Vehicle D, driven by Ms. Niemi.

The incident occurred during an overcast day, with occasional light rain showers that made road conditions slippery and visibility poor. Witnesses reported that Mr. Mäki appeared to be driving recklessly before the collision, weaving in and out of lanes and failing to adjust his speed according to the weather conditions.

Upon arrival at the scene, emergency services found all parties involved conscious but shaken. Ms. Koskela sustained minor injuries and was transported to Pori Central Hospital for further evaluation. The other drivers and passengers did not report any injuries.

The vehicles involved in the incident were extensively damaged. Vehicle A had front-end damage, with the bumper and grille crushed. Vehicle B suffered significant front-end and side damage, as well as a shattered windshield. Vehicle C was severely damaged on both the front and rear ends, with extensive bodywork required for repairs. Vehicle D sustained moderate damage to its front end and undercarriage.

The incident is currently under investigation by the Pori Police Department's traffic unit. Preliminary findings suggest that Mr. Mäki may have been driving under the influence of alcohol at the time of the collision, and charges are pending further investigation and lab results.

This report will be updated as more information becomes available.
