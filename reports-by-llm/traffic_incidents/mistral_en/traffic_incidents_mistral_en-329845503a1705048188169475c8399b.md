 Title: Traffic Incident Report - Forssa, Finland - 10.02.2023, Evening

Incident Summary:
A multi-vehicle collision occurred on Väinö Linnanaukio Street (State Road 5) near the intersection with Kauppakatu (Main Street), in Forssa, Finland, at approximately 18:45 local time. Ten vehicles were involved in the incident, resulting in minor injuries to several individuals and significant traffic disruptions.

Incident Narrative:
On the evening of February 10th, 2023, a mixed snow and rain storm created challenging driving conditions on Väinö Linnanaukio Street. As darkness fell, visibility was further reduced, making it difficult for drivers to navigate the slippery roads.

At approximately 18:45, a westbound Toyota Corolla (license plate F-ABC 123) driven by Mr. Juhani Mäki (age 35) lost traction on the road due to the adverse weather conditions and began to slide towards the eastbound lanes. Simultaneously, an eastbound Volvo V60 (license plate F-DEF 456), driven by Ms. Liisa Koskela (age 42), was unable to stop in time due to reduced visibility and skidded into the oncoming lane.

The two vehicles collided head-on, causing both to spin out of control and be struck by several other vehicles traveling in both directions. In total, ten vehicles were involved in the collision, with minor injuries reported for Ms. Koskela, Mr. Mäki, and three other individuals.

Witnesses at the scene reported that the incident occurred quickly and without warning, as many drivers struggled to maintain control of their vehicles due to the poor road conditions. Several witnesses provided statements to the police, offering accounts of the events leading up to and following the collision.

Investigation and Findings:
The Finnish Police responded promptly to the scene, with emergency services arriving within minutes. The road was closed in both directions to allow for the safe extraction of injured parties and the investigation of the incident.

Upon examination of the vehicles involved, it was determined that the Toyota Corolla had hydroplaned on the wet and icy surface, causing it to lose control and enter the eastbound lanes. The Volvo V60, traveling at a moderate speed due to the adverse weather conditions, was unable to avoid the collision.

The other vehicles involved in the incident were primarily rear-ended as they approached the scene, with minimal damage to their front ends. The majority of the damage occurred to the Toyota Corolla and Volvo V60, which sustained significant front-end and undercarriage damage.

Conclusion:
The multi-vehicle collision on Väinö Linnanaukio Street in Forssa was caused by a combination of adverse weather conditions and reduced visibility due to darkness. The incident resulted in minor injuries to several individuals and significant traffic disruptions. The road was closed for several hours while the scene was investigated and cleared, with traffic being diverted through nearby streets.

Recommendations:
In light of this incident, it is recommended that drivers exercise caution when driving on wet and icy roads, especially during periods of mixed snow and rain. Drivers should reduce their speed, maintain a safe following distance, and be prepared for sudden changes in road conditions. Additionally, it is advisable to ensure that vehicles are properly equipped with winter tires and that windshield wipers and headlights are functioning correctly during inclement weather.
