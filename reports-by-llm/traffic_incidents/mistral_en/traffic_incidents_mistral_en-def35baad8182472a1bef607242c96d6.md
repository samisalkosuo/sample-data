 Title: Traffic Incident Report
Date: August 29, 2024
Location: Kouvola, Finland
Incident Number: TI-KOU-240829-001

On the morning of August 29, 2024, at approximately 08:37 AM local time, a traffic incident occurred on Helsingintie (State Road 6), near the intersection with Kymppivuorenkatu, in Kouvola. The incident involved two vehicles: a silver Toyota Corolla (license plate F-XYZ123) driven by Mr. Jukka Saarinen, and a black Volkswagen Golf (license plate O-ABC456) driven by Ms. Liisa Mäki.

According to eyewitness accounts, the incident occurred during mixed snow and rain conditions, which had made the roads slippery and reduced visibility. Mr. Saarinen was traveling southbound on Helsingintie, while Ms. Mäki was turning left from Kymppivuorenkatu onto Helsingintie.

The preliminary investigation suggests that due to the adverse weather conditions, Mr. Saarinen lost control of his vehicle as he approached the intersection. His Toyota Corolla slid on the wet and icy road, crossing into the opposite lane and colliding with Ms. Mäki's Volkswagen Golf.

The impact caused significant damage to both vehicles. The front end of Mr. Saarinen's Toyota was severely crumpled, while Ms. Mäki's Volkswagen sustained damage to its passenger side. Both drivers and their respective passengers—Ms. Anna Saarinen (passenger in the Corolla) and Mr. Markku Mäki (passenger in the Golf)—were wearing seatbelts and were able to exit their vehicles without assistance.

No serious injuries were reported, although all four individuals involved in the incident sought medical attention as a precautionary measure. The road was closed for approximately two hours while emergency services attended to the scene and cleared debris.

The investigation is ongoing, with a focus on determining the exact cause of the accident and any contributing factors related to the weather conditions or vehicle maintenance. This report will be updated as more information becomes available.
