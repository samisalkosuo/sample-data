Location: Lumijoki, Finland
Incident Number: 24-13875

On the day of September 6th, 2024, at approximately 14:37 hours, a multi-vehicle collision occurred on Kauppakatu (Shopping Street) near the intersection with Miettisalmentie (Mietti Farm Road), in Lumijoki. The incident involved seven vehicles and resulted in minor injuries to several individuals.

The following is a detailed account of the events leading up to the collision:

14:35 hours - A white Volvo XC90, driven by Mr. Jari Mäki (license plate F-XYZ 123), was traveling southbound on Kauppakatu at an estimated speed of 60 km/h. The vehicle was carrying three passengers: Mrs. Sanna Mäki, their daughter Emilia, and a family friend, Mr. Eero Koskela.

Simultaneously, a black Mercedes-Benz CLS (license plate O-ABC 456), driven by Ms. Liisa Nurmi, was traveling northbound on Kauppakatu at an estimated speed of 70 km/h. In the vehicle were two passengers: Mr. Jukka Nurmi and their daughter, Anna.

14:36 hours - As both vehicles approached the intersection with Miettisalmentie, a sudden snow squall reduced visibility to near zero. Ms. Liisa Nurmi failed to notice the red traffic light and proceeded into the intersection, colliding with Mr. Jari Mäki's Volvo XC90.

The impact caused both vehicles to spin out of control, with the Volvo coming to a stop on the northbound lane of Kauppakatu, while the Mercedes-Benz came to rest partially on the sidewalk and blocking the southbound lanes.

14:37 hours - A black Toyota Corolla (license plate P-DEF 789), driven by Mr. Marko Saari, was traveling southbound behind the Volvo XC90. Upon seeing the collision, he attempted to swerve to avoid the accident but struck the rear of the Mercedes-Benz.

The impact caused the Toyota Corolla to spin and collide with a parked vehicle, a blue Ford Fiesta (license plate G-HIJ 321), belonging to Mr. Jari Lappalainen. The Ford Fiesta was pushed into a nearby snowbank.

14:38 hours - A red Opel Astra (license plate K-LMN 456) and a green Skoda Octavia (license plate P-OPQ 789), driven by Mr. Mikko Hämäläinen and Ms. Anna Lehto, respectively, were also involved in the collision as they attempted to navigate the chaotic scene. Both vehicles sustained significant damage but did not collide with other vehicles.

14:39 hours - Emergency services arrived on the scene, including police, fire department, and ambulance personnel. The injured parties were treated at the scene before being transported to Lumijoki Hospital for further evaluation and treatment. No fatalities were reported.

The road was closed for several hours while the accident investigation team examined the scene and collected evidence. The snowy conditions made it difficult to determine exact speeds and the sequence of events, but it is believed that the initial collision between the Volvo XC90 and Mercedes-Benz triggered the subsequent chain reaction.

The incident serves as a reminder for drivers to exercise caution during adverse weather conditions and to always obey traffic laws. The investigation into the accident is ongoing, with charges pending against Ms. Liisa Nurmi for failing to stop at a red light.
