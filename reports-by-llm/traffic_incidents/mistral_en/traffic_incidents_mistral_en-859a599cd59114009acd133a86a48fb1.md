Incident Summary:
At approximately 23:37 on January 11th, 2024, a multi-vehicle collision occurred on Kauppi Road in Finström. Ten vehicles were involved in the incident, resulting in minor injuries to several individuals and significant traffic disruption.

Upon arrival at the scene, it was observed that a line of vehicles extending approximately 300 meters along Kauppi Road had collided due to poor visibility caused by light rain. The first vehicle involved, a silver 2023 Volvo XC90 (license plate F-ABC 123) driven by Mr. Juhani Lehto, was traveling southbound when it encountered a stopped red Toyota Corolla (license plate O-DEF 456), driven by Ms. Sanna Mäki, due to reduced visibility and slick road conditions.

Mr. Lehto attempted to swerve to the right but lost control of his vehicle, which then collided with a black Audi Q7 (license plate G-HIJ 789) driven by Mr. Markku Korpela, who was also traveling southbound. The impact caused both vehicles to spin out of control and collide with other oncoming vehicles in the opposite lane.

The chain reaction continued as a blue Ford Mustang (license plate L-MNO 012), driven by Ms. Liisa Niemi, traveling northbound, was unable to avoid the collision and crashed into the rear of the Audi Q7. The impact caused the Mustang to spin out of control and collide with a white Peugeot 308 (license plate P-QRS 234), driven by Mr. Petri Saari, who was also traveling northbound.

The collision resulted in a domino effect, involving six additional vehicles before coming to a halt. The vehicles involved were extensively damaged, with the Volvo XC90 sustaining front-end damage, the Toyota Corolla having rear-end damage, and the Audi Q7 and Ford Mustang both experiencing significant front and rear damage.

Emergency services arrived at the scene within minutes and assessed the injuries of those involved. Ms. Mäki, Mr. Korpela, Ms. Niemi, and Mr. Saari were treated for minor injuries and released on the spot. The other drivers and passengers involved in the incident were unharmed.

The road was closed for several hours while emergency services cleared the scene and police conducted an investigation into the cause of the collision. The incident has been reported to the local authorities, who will determine any further action necessary.

This report is based on the information gathered at the scene by Officer Antero Koskela #12345.
