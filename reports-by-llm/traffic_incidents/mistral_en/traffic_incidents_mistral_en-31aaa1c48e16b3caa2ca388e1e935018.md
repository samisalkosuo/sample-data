Incident Summary:
A multiple-vehicle collision occurred on Vuokatinportti Street at approximately 11:37 PM local time, involving three vehicles. The incident took place near the intersection with Kauppakatu, in the heart of Joensuu city center.

Vehicles Involved:
1. Vehicle A (Licence Plate: FIN-ABC 123) - A 2023 Toyota Corolla driven by Mr. Jukka Saarinen, aged 45, of Kauppakatu 28, Joensuu.
2. Vehicle B (Licence Plate: FIN-DEF 456) - A 2019 Volkswagen Golf driven by Ms. Liisa MÃ¤ki, aged 37, of Vuokatinportti Street 45, Joensuu.
3. Vehicle C (Licence Plate: FIN-GHI 789) - A 2016 Ford Focus driven by Mr. Marko Nurmi, aged 28, of Kauppakatu 12, Joensuu. There were two passengers in the vehicle: Ms. Anna Hietala, aged 25, and Mr. Eero Lappalainen, aged 30, both residents of Kauppakatu 12 as well.

Witnesses:
A local resident, Mr. Jari Koskela (address withheld for privacy reasons), reported observing the incident from his apartment window on Vuokatinportti Street. He stated that he saw Vehicle A traveling southbound on Vuokatinportti Street, while Vehicles B and C were stopped at a red light at the intersection with Kauppakatu.

According to Mr. Koskela's account, as Vehicle A approached the intersection, it failed to slow down or stop, sliding on the icy road surface due to excessive speed. The vehicle collided with the rear of Vehicle B, which was then pushed into the path of Vehicle C, causing a chain reaction collision.

Upon arrival at the scene, emergency services found all parties involved in the incident uninjured but shaken. However, Vehicles A and B sustained significant damage to their front ends, while Vehicle C suffered minor damage to its rear bumper.

Road Conditions:
The road conditions at the time of the incident were reported as icy by witnesses and responding officers. The slippery surface likely contributed to the loss of control experienced by Vehicle A, ultimately leading to the collision.

Investigation:
The investigation into this incident is ongoing, with a focus on determining the exact cause of the excessive speed exhibited by Vehicle A. Preliminary findings suggest that the driver may have been distracted or impaired at the time of the accident. Further analysis of the vehicles and interviews with witnesses will be conducted to confirm these suspicions.

Conclusion:
This incident serves as a reminder for all road users to exercise caution, especially during adverse weather conditions such as icy roads. Drivers are encouraged to reduce their speed, maintain focus on the road, and always prioritize safety over haste.
