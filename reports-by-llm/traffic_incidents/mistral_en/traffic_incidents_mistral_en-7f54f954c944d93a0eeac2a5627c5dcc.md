 Title: Traffic Incident Report
Date: February 26, 2024
Location: Uusikaarlepyy, Finland
Incident Number: 24-03178

On the evening of February 26, 2024, at approximately 19:35, a traffic incident occurred on Kauppakatu (Shopping Street) near the intersection with Mannerheimintie (Mannerheim Avenue), in Uusikaarlepyy. The incident involved two vehicles: a silver Volkswagen Golf TSI bearing Finnish license plate FAB 123 and a black Toyota Corolla Hybrid with license plate XYZ 456.

Witnesses at the scene reported that the thunderstorm had been ongoing for about an hour, causing reduced visibility and slippery road conditions due to rainwater mixing with snow. The storm had also resulted in frequent lightning strikes, which may have momentarily blinded drivers.

According to eyewitness accounts, the Volkswagen Golf was traveling southbound on Kauppakatu when it hydroplaned due to the wet and slippery road conditions. The vehicle lost control and veered into the northbound lane, colliding with the Toyota Corolla that was being driven by Mr. Jari M채ki (42) of Mannerheimintie 123A.

Mr. M채ki, who was unharmed in the collision, immediately stopped his vehicle and exited to assist the driver of the Volkswagen. The driver of the Golf, a woman identified as Ms. Liisa Koskela (35) of Kauppakatu 45B, appeared disoriented due to the accident and the stormy weather. She was removed from her vehicle by Mr. M채ki and other witnesses who had stopped to help.

Ms. Koskela was transported to Uusikaarlepyy Hospital for a thorough examination and treatment of minor injuries sustained in the collision. The Toyota Corolla, while damaged, remained drivable, and Mr. M채ki was able to move it to the side of the road.

The Finnish Traffic Police responded promptly to the incident scene and conducted an investigation into the cause of the accident. The road was closed for approximately one hour while the vehicles were removed and the scene was cleared. The police have advised that charges are not expected against either driver due to the adverse weather conditions contributing significantly to the incident.

This report is based on eyewitness accounts, statements from the drivers involved, and an on-scene investigation by Finnish Traffic Police officers. The incident remains under further review for any additional findings or recommendations.
