 Title: Traffic Incident Report - Puolanka, Finland - 27.08.2024, Evening Hours

Incident Summary:
On the evening of August 27th, 2024, at approximately 19:35 local time, a traffic incident occurred on Kauppakatu (Shopping Street) in Puolanka, Finland. The incident involved two vehicles: a silver 2023 Volvo XC60 with license plate F-ABC 123 and a black 2024 Toyota Corolla Hybrid with license plate O-DEF 456.

Incident Narrative:
Witnesses report that the Volvo, driven by Mr. Juhani MÃ¤ki (age 38, resident of Kauppakatu 10) was traveling southbound on Kauppakatu at a moderate speed. Simultaneously, the Toyota, driven by Ms. Liisa Koskela (age 45, resident of Kauppakatu 25), was turning left from Linnankatu onto Kauppakatu, intending to head northbound.

As Ms. Koskela began her turn, the snowy conditions on the road caused her vehicle to lose traction, causing it to slide diagonally into the path of the oncoming Volvo. The front ends of both vehicles collided, with the Toyota spinning and coming to a halt on the eastern side of Kauppakatu, while the Volvo came to a stop on the western side.

Emergency services were notified immediately, and the scene was secured by local law enforcement. Both drivers and passengers reported no serious injuries, but were assessed at the scene by paramedics for any potential minor injuries or discomfort.

Damage Assessment:
Upon inspection of the vehicles, it was determined that both sustained significant damage as a result of the collision. The Volvo's front bumper and grille were crushed, with noticeable damage to the hood and windshield. The Toyota's front end also suffered extensive damage, including a collapsed passenger side door and a damaged engine compartment.

Weather and Road Conditions:
The incident occurred during a snowfall that had been ongoing for several hours, with visibility reduced due to heavy snow accumulation on the roads. The road surface was slick and slippery, contributing to the loss of control experienced by Ms. Koskela's vehicle.

Conclusion:
This traffic incident is currently under investigation by local law enforcement. Preliminary findings suggest that the primary cause of the accident was the snowy conditions on Kauppakatu, which led to a loss of traction for Ms. Koskela's vehicle as she turned left onto the street. Both drivers were found to be operating their vehicles within the speed limit and without any signs of impairment.

Recommendations:
In light of the snowy conditions that contributed to this incident, it is recommended that motorists exercise caution when driving in adverse weather conditions, especially during periods of heavy snowfall. Additionally, road maintenance crews should prioritize clearing snow and treating roads during such events to minimize the risk of similar incidents occurring in the future.
