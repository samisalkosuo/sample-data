Incident Number: TI-231123-001

On the day of November 23, 2023, at approximately 14:37 hours, a traffic incident occurred on Kauppakatu (Shopping Street) near the intersection with Mannerheimintie (Mannerheim Avenue), in the heart of Perho. The incident involved two vehicles: a silver Volvo V60 with license plate F-ABC 123 and a black Audi Q5 with license plate X-DEF 456.

According to eyewitness accounts, the Volvo, driven by Mr. Juhani Särkijärvi (age 45, resident of Kauppakatu 27), was traveling southbound on Kauppakatu while the Audi, driven by Ms. Liisa Mäkelä (age 38, resident of Mannerheimintie 19), was turning left from Mannerheimintie onto Kauppakatu. The weather conditions at the time were wet and slippery, which significantly impacted the scene.

The incident unfolded as follows: Mr. Särkijärvi approached the intersection at a moderate speed, while Ms. Mäkelä was waiting to make her left turn. As she began her turn, her Audi started to slide on the wet road surface, causing her vehicle to collide with the front passenger side of Mr. Särkijärvi's Volvo. The impact caused both vehicles to spin out of control before coming to a halt on the opposite sides of the intersection.

Upon arrival, emergency services found no injuries among the drivers or passengers involved. Both Mr. Särkijärvi and Ms. Mäkelä were cooperative and provided their statements to the investigating officer. Witnesses at the scene corroborated their accounts, stating that the slippery road conditions played a significant role in the accident.

The Volvo sustained damage to its front passenger side, with the bumper and fender being dented and scratched. The Audi's left front corner was also damaged, with the headlight and wheel rim showing signs of impact. Both vehicles were towed away from the scene for further inspection and repairs.

The incident caused minor traffic disruptions in the area as emergency services attended to the scene and cleared the roadway. The Perho Police Department would like to remind drivers to exercise caution, especially during wet and slippery conditions, to help prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.

This report is preliminary and subject to further investigation by the Perho Police Department's Traffic Investigation Unit.
