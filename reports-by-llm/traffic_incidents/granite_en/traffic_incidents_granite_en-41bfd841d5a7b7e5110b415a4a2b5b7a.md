*Incident Number:* 2024-RAU-001  
*Date of Incident:* 01.10.2024

*Reporting Officer:* Inspector Jouko Hietala, Rautalampi Police Department  

**Narrative:**

On the morning of 01.10.2024, at approximately 08:30, a two-vehicle collision occurred on Kauppakatu, a primary road in the heart of Rautalampi. The incident involved a silver 2019 Toyota Corolla, registered with the license plate 123-ABC, driven by Mr. Mikko Koskinen, a 45-year-old local resident, and a blue 2020 Ford Focus, identified by its license plate number 456-DEF, operated by Ms. Anna Pitkänen, a 32-year-old teacher residing at Kauppakatu 10.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **08:25**: Mr. Koskinen departed from his residence at Kauppakatu 5 for his daily commute to work in Helsinki. Ms. Pitkänen was already on her way to drop off her child at the nearby Rautalampi School, traveling in the opposite direction.
- **08:28**: Both drivers encountered icy road conditions as a light snowfall had occurred overnight, reducing visibility and grip.
- **08:30**: As Mr. Koskinen approached the intersection with School Street, Ms. Pitkänen was navigating the same junction to turn left towards the school. Despite both drivers maintaining a safe speed for the icy conditions, the combined factors of reduced traction and momentary lapse in attention led to a loss of control for Mr. Koskinen's vehicle.
- **08:31**: The Toyota Corolla skidded on the icy road, crossing the center line and colliding with the passenger side of Ms. Pitkänen’s Ford Focus, which was executing a left turn.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The morning was characterized by intermittent light snowfall, resulting in icy road surfaces. Visibility was moderately reduced due to falling snow, contributing to the challenging driving conditions. The Finnish Meteorological Institute's weather report for Rautalampi on this date confirms these conditions.

**Vehicle Damage:**

- The Toyota Corolla sustained significant damage to its passenger side, including a dented door, a shattered side window, and front-end collision marks.
- The Ford Focus incurred damage to its rear passenger side, with a crumpled door, a broken taillight, and paint transfer indicating the point of impact.

**Witnesses:**

Two passersby, Ms. Liisa Mäkelä and Mr. Jussi Rantala, witnessed the incident and immediately contacted emergency services at 08:32. They reported that both drivers exited their vehicles unharmed but visibly shaken.

**Action Taken:**

Emergency medical services arrived promptly and assessed both drivers and passengers, confirming no injuries beyond minor shock. The Finnish Traffic Management Center was notified to clear the scene and manage traffic flow efficiently, given the morning rush hour. Both vehicles were towed away for inspection and repairs by 09:15.

**Investigation Status:**

An initial investigation suggests no criminal negligence but highlights the importance of vigilance during adverse weather conditions. Both drivers have been advised to review their driving practices in such scenarios. Further analysis of vehicle data recorders (black boxes) is pending to corroborate witness statements and driver recollections.
