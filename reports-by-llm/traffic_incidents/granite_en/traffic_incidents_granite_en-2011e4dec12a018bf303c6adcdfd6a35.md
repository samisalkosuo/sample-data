**Narrative:**

On the afternoon of 25 February 2023, at approximately 14:15 hours, a two-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ratinkatu in Tervo, Finland. The drivers involved were identified as Mikko Aalto, 34, residing at Hietaniemi 12, Tervo, and Olli Pekkarinen, 47, from Kauppiakademi 5, Tervo.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **14:08 hours:** Mr. Aalto, driving a white 2018 Volkswagen Passat registered with the license plate 34-VWP, proceeded northbound on Kauppakatu approaching the intersection with Ratinkatu.

- **14:10 hours:** Mr. Pekkarinen, operating a blue 2015 Ford Focus bearing the license plate 78-FOR, turned left from southbound Ratinkatu onto Kauppakatu intending to proceed north.

- **14:12 hours:** As Mr. Aalto's vehicle entered the intersection first, Mr. Pekkarinen's car collided with the passenger side of the Volkswagen Passat. The impact caused significant damage to both vehicles; the Passat sustained a dented passenger door and a cracked headlight, while the Focus received substantial front-end damage, including a collapsed front fender and a damaged hood.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

At the time of the incident, snowfall was ongoing, reducing visibility and creating slippery road conditions. The intersection lacked adequate snow clearing, contributing to reduced traction for both drivers.

**Witness Statements:**

A passerby, Ms. Leena Korhonen, provided a statement confirming that both vehicles were moving at moderate speeds and that Mr. Pekkarinen's turn was initiated without sufficient caution, given the adverse weather conditions.

**Damage Assessment:**

The Volkswagen Passat incurred approximately €3,500 in repairs, primarily for the passenger door and headlight replacement. The Ford Focus sustained damages estimated at around €6,000, encompassing front-end structural repairs and cosmetic fixes.

**Medical Attendance:**

Both drivers declined medical attention on-site, reporting no injuries. However, they were advised to seek a medical check-up as a precaution due to the force of the collision.

**Conclusion:**

The collision appears to have resulted from Mr. Pekkarinen's failure to exercise due care while making a left turn during snowy conditions. No criminal charges were immediately filed, but a formal report has been submitted for potential traffic violation considerations. Both parties have been advised to contact their respective insurance providers for claim processing.
