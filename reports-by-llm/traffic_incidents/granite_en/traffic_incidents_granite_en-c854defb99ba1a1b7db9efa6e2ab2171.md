**Traffic Incident Report**

*Incident Number:* 2025-LEM-0616-003  
*Date of Incident:* 16th June 2025  
*Location:* Intersection of Kauppakatu and Ruotsalanpuro, Lemi, Finland  
*Reporting Officer:* Inspector Jouko Hietala, Lemi Police Department  

**Narrative:**

On the evening of 16th June 2025, at approximately 18:45 hours, a three-vehicle traffic incident occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ruotsalanpuro in the municipality of Lemi, Finland. The weather conditions were heavy rain, which significantly impacted visibility and road grip.

The primary vehicles involved were:
1. A silver 2020 Toyota Corolla, registered as FIN-123XY, driven by Mr. Mikko Koskinen, a 34-year-old local resident of Kauppakatu 23, proceeding northbound on Kauppakatu.
2. A blue 2018 Volvo V60, registered as FIN-456ZX, driven by Ms. Sanna Pitkänen, a 29-year-old resident of Ruotsalanpuro 11, traveling eastbound on Ruotsalanpuro approaching the intersection.
3. A grey 2015 Ford Focus, registered as FIN-789LM, driven by Mr. Jussi Laine, a 45-year-old resident of Kauppakatu 45, heading southbound on Kauppakatu.

**Timeline of Events:**

- At 18:40 hours, Ms. Pitkänen, driving the Volvo, approached the stop line at Ruotsalanpuro, intending to turn left onto Kauppakatu. She activated her left indicator, but due to heavy rain and slippery road conditions, she failed to halt completely before entering the intersection.
- Simultaneously, Mr. Koskinen in the Corolla was traveling north on Kauppakatu, maintaining a speed within the 50 km/h limit. He observed Ms. Pitkänen's Volvo partially entering the intersection but mistakenly assumed she would come to a full stop.
- Mr. Laine, driving the Ford Focus southbound on Kauppakatu, noticed Ms. Pitkänen’s partial entry into the intersection and attempted to brake hard. However, the wet road conditions caused his vehicle to skid, colliding with the passenger side of Ms. Pitkänen's Volvo.
- The impact of Mr. Laine's Focus with Ms. Pitkänen's car propelled her Volvo into a collision with Mr. Koskinen’s Corolla, striking it on the driver's side.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

Heavy rainfall was reported throughout the Helsinki metropolitan area, including Lemi, from 18:00 to 19:00 hours. The roads were wet, reducing visibility and traction, contributing factors in the severity of this incident.

**Vehicle Damage:**

- The Volvo V60 sustained significant damage to its passenger side, including a collapsed front passenger door and extensive denting to the side panel.
- The Ford Focus suffered damage to its front driver's side, with a crumpled hood and substantial scratches along the right fender.
- The Toyota Corolla bore impact marks on its driver’s side, with a dented door and scrapes along the rear quarter panel.

**Witnesses:**

Two pedestrians, Ms. Anna Rautiainen and Mr. Olli Mäkelä, walking home from nearby grocery stores on Kauppakatu, witnessed the incident and provided statements corroborating the sequence of events.

**Conclusion:**

The traffic incident was primarily caused by Ms. Pitkänen's failure to come to a complete stop at the intersection stop line under adverse weather conditions. The ensuing chain reaction, exacerbated by wet road surfaces, led to the collision involving all three vehicles. No serious injuries were reported, though all parties involved sought medical attention as a precaution.
