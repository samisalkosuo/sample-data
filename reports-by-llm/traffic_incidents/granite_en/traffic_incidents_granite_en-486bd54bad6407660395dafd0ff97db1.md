**Traffic Incident Report**

*Incident Number:* 2025-PUN-0426  
*Date of Incident:* 26 April 2025  
*Location:* Intersection of Kauppakatu and Ratinkatu, Punkalaidun, Finland  
*Reporting Officer:* Inspector Jouko Hietanen  

**Narrative:**

On the evening of 26 April 2025, at approximately 18:30 hours, a two-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ratinkatu in Punkalaidun. The incident involved a grey 2019 Toyota Corolla, driven by Mr. Mikko Koskinen, age 45, residing at Kauppakatu 123, and a silver 2020 Ford Focus, operated by Ms. Anna Pietilä, age 32, from Ratinkatu 456.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **18:25 hours:** Mr. Koskinen was travelling southbound on Kauppakatu towards the intersection with Ratinkatu. Ms. Pietilä was proceeding eastbound on Ratinkatu, approaching the same intersection.

- **18:28 hours:** Both drivers were within visual range of each other, yet heavy rainfall reduced visibility significantly. The precipitation, coupled with the slippery road surface due to recent cleaning operations, contributed to challenging driving conditions.

- **18:30 hours:** As Mr. Koskinen entered the intersection intending to turn left onto Ratinkatu, Ms. Pietilä, following the traffic signals, continued straight through. The vehicles collided at approximately the centre of the intersection.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The evening was marked by persistent heavy rainfall, with visibility reduced to around 50 metres. Road surfaces were wet, exacerbating braking distances and potentially contributing to the severity of the collision.

**Vehicle Details and Damage:**

- **Toyota Corolla (Finland's license plate 123-MK):** The front passenger side sustained significant damage, including a crumpled fender and a dented door. Airbag deployment was noted, indicating occupant restraint during the impact.

- **Ford Focus (Finland's license plate 789-AP):** The driver’s side front experienced substantial damage, with the hood caved in and windshield shattered. Ms. Pietilä reported minor injuries consistent with airbag usage.

**Witnesses:**

Two passersby, Mr. Jari Lehtinen and Ms. Laura Kivinen, provided statements corroborating the described sequence of events. They noted that both drivers appeared shaken but not visibly impaired by alcohol or drugs.

**Conclusion:**

The collision appears to have resulted from a misjudgment in the intersection due to adverse weather conditions rather than driver negligence. Both parties cooperated with the investigation, and no citations were issued at this time pending further review of dashcam footage (if available) and final toxicology reports.
