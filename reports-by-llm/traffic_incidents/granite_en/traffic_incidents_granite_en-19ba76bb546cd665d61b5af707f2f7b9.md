**Narrative:**

On the morning of 21st July 2023, at approximately 08:45, a multi-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppiakademiestie and Yliannistie in Lappeenranta, Finland. The incident involved seven vehicles, resulting in various degrees of damage and minor injuries to the drivers and passengers.

The primary sequence of events unfolded as follows:

- At 08:40, a white 2019 Toyota Corolla, registered KY-12345, driven by Mr. Mikko Koskinen, 34, of Kauppiakademiestie 23, was proceeding north on Kauppiakademiestie towards the intersection.

- Simultaneously, a grey 2017 Ford Focus, registered LA-67890, driven by Ms. Anna Pietilä, 28, of Yliannistie 45, approached from the east on Yliannistie intending to turn left onto Kauppiakademiestie.

- As Ms. Pietilä initiated her left turn, she reportedly misjudged the speed and distance of oncoming traffic due to heavy rainfall reducing visibility. Her vehicle was struck on the passenger side by the Toyota Corolla driven by Mr. Koskinen.

- The impact caused Ms. Pietilä's Ford Focus to rotate, colliding with a red 2015 Volkswagen Golf, registered VW-23456, driven by Mr. Jussi Rantala, 42, of Yliannistie 12, who was following closely behind. The Golf sustained damage to its front bumper and hood.

- Meanwhile, a black 2020 Honda Civic, registered HC-78901, driven by Ms. Sanna Lehtinen, 30, of Kauppiakademiestie 56, was traveling south on Kauppiakademiestie and collided with debris from the initial impacts, sustaining minor front-end damage.

- Following this, a blue 2018 Nissan Qashqai, registered NQ-34567, driven by Mr. Olli Mäkelä, 50, of Yliannistie 99, attempted to avoid the crash scene but skidded on the wet road surface, losing control and striking a pedestrian crossing the street at the intersection. The pedestrian, Ms. Kaisa Hietala, 60, of Kauppiakademiestie 33, suffered minor injuries.

- In the aftermath, a green 2016 BMW X1, registered BM-89012, driven by Mr. Timo Kivinen, 45, of Yliannistie 77, was rear-ended by a silver 2019 Audi A3, registered AS-56789, driven by Ms. Laura Virtanen, 29, of Kauppiakademiestie 88, who failed to stop in time due to the heavy rain impairing braking distance.
