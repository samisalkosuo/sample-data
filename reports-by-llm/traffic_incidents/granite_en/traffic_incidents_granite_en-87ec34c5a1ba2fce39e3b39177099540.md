*Incident Number:* 2025-PIR-0802  
*Date of Incident:* 02.08.2025  
*Location:* Intersection of Kauppakatu and Pohjoiskosenturiantori, Pirkkala, Finland  
*Reporting Officer:* Jari P. Korhonen, Badge #4923  

**Narrative:**

On the afternoon of 02.08.2025, at approximately 14:15 hours, a two-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Pohjoiskosenturiantori in Pirkkala, Finland. The incident involved a grey 2019 Toyota Corolla, registered with the license plate 34-AJK, driven by Mr. Mikko Hietanen, a 38-year-old local resident of Kauppakatu 12, and a white 2020 Ford Focus, bearing the license plate 56-KAL, operated by Ms. Anna Pitkänen, a 25-year-old resident of Pohjoiskosenturiantori 3.

**Timeline of Events:**

1. **14:08 hours:** Ms. Pitkänen, driving the Ford Focus, proceeded northbound on Pohjoiskosenturiantori towards its intersection with Kauppakatu. Mr. Hietanen, in the Toyota Corolla, was stationary at a red traffic signal on Kauppakatu, awaiting the green light to proceed eastbound.

2. **14:13 hours:** The traffic lights turned green for both directions. Mr. Hietanen began to accelerate from the stop line, intending to turn left onto Pohjoiskosenturiantori.

3. **14:14 hours:** As Mr. Hietanen entered the intersection, Ms. Pitkänen, continuing northbound on Pohjoiskosenturiantori, collided with the passenger side of his vehicle. The impact occurred while both vehicles were in the crossing path, resulting in significant damage to both cars.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

At the time of the incident, a dense fog had settled over Pirkkala, reducing visibility to approximately 50 meters. The road surfaces were damp due to intermittent light rain, compounding the hazardous conditions for drivers. These weather conditions likely contributed to both drivers' reduced ability to perceive each other's approach within the limited visibility.

**Vehicle Damage:**

The Toyota Corolla sustained damage primarily to its passenger side, including a crumpled door, shattered side window, and substantial paint transfer. The Ford Focus incurred front-end damage, with a bent hood, damaged headlights, and scrapes along the driver's side.

**Witnesses:**

Two pedestrians, Mr. Jussi Koskinen and Ms. Laura Virtanen, who were walking their dogs in adjacent parks, witnessed the incident and provided statements to the responding officers. They confirmed that both vehicles entered the intersection simultaneously under reduced visibility conditions.

**Conclusion:**

The collision appears to have resulted from a failure to yield right-of-way, compounded by adverse weather conditions impairing visibility. Both drivers are cooperating with the investigation, and no injuries were reported. The vehicles have been towed to a secure location for further examination, and the intersection will be reviewed for potential improvements in lighting or signage to mitigate similar incidents in future foggy conditions.
