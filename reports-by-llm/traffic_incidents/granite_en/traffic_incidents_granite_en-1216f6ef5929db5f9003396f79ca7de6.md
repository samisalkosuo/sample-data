**Narrative:**

On the afternoon of 22nd January, 2024, at approximately 14:30 hours, a two-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Pohjoiskarinkuunpuu in Riihimäki, Finland. The incident involved a grey 2018 Volvo V60, registered with the license plate 123-ABC, driven by Mr. Mikko Kivinen, a 45-year-old local resident of Kauppakatu 23, and a white 2020 Toyota Corolla, registered with the license plate 456-DEF, operated by Ms. Anna Pitkänen, a 32-year-old residing at Pohjoiskarinkuunpuu 17.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **14:28 hours:** Mr. Kivinen was travelling southbound on Kauppakatu towards the intersection intending to turn right onto Pohjoiskarinkuunpuu. Ms. Pitkänen was proceeding westbound on Pohjoiskarinkuunpuu, approaching the intersection with a green light in her favor.

- **14:29 hours:** As Mr. Kivinen prepared to turn right, icy road conditions caused his vehicle to lose traction. He applied the brakes but was unable to prevent sliding into the intersection.

- **14:30 hours:** The Volvo V60 collided with the Toyota Corolla driven by Ms. Pitkänen, who was proceeding through the intersection with a green light. The impact occurred on the passenger side of both vehicles.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The roads were reported icy due to overnight freezing temperatures following snowfall. Visibility was clear, but the icy conditions contributed significantly to Mr. Kivinen's loss of control over his vehicle. No other adverse weather factors were noted apart from the prevailing cold and ice.

**Vehicle Damage:**

The Volvo V60 sustained damage primarily to its passenger side, including a dented front fender and scratches along the door. The Toyota Corolla incurred damage to its passenger side as well, with a crumpled rear door and minor paint transfer from the Volvo.

**Witnesses:**

Two witnesses, Mr. Jari Lehtinen and Ms. Laura Mäkelä, who were nearby at a local café, provided statements confirming the sequence of events and corroborating the drivers' accounts. They noted that both vehicles came to a stop immediately after the collision due to the impact.

**Medical Response:**

Both Mr. Kivinen and Ms. Pitkänen reported minor injuries and were transported to Riihimäki Central Hospital for evaluation as a precautionary measure. No passengers were involved in either vehicle.

**Investigation Outcome:**

The investigation concluded that the primary cause of the collision was the icy road conditions leading to Mr. Kivinen's loss of control, resulting in the right-angle impact with Ms. Pitkänen’s vehicle. No evidence suggested driver negligence beyond the challenging weather circumstances.
