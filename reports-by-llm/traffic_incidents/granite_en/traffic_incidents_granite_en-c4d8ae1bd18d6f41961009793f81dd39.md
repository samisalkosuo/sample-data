**Weather and Road Conditions:**

At the time of the incident, weather conditions were windy with gusts, reducing visibility slightly and contributing to driver distraction. The road surface was dry but wind-blown debris increased the risk of sudden hazards.

**Vehicle Damage Descriptions:**

**Witness Statements:**

Several pedestrians in the vicinity provided consistent accounts of the events, noting the suddenness and severity of the collisions. A nearby café's CCTV footage corroborates their statements, capturing the sequence of impacts clearly.

**Conclusion:**

The collision was primarily caused by Mr. Kivinen misjudging the speed and proximity of oncoming traffic while making a left turn. The windy conditions exacerbated driver alertness and reaction times, contributing to the chain-reaction impacts. All drivers involved were cited for failing to maintain safe following distances and adhering to traffic regulations under the prevailing weather conditions.
