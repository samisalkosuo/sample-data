On 04.04.2025, at approximately 14:30, the Savukoski Police Department responded to a multi-vehicle collision at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ratinkatu in the municipality of Savukoski, Finland. Upon arrival, officers found ten vehicles involved in a complex chain-reaction accident.

**Timeline of Events:**

1. **14:25 (2:25 PM):** A white 2020 Toyota Corolla, registered as FIN-123XY, driven by Mr. Jari Koskinen, 38, from nearby Pietarsaari, was traveling eastbound on Kauppakatu approaching the intersection with Ratinkatu.

3. **14:27 (2:27 PM):** Mr. Koskinen's vehicle proceeded through a green light at the intersection. Ms. Pitkänen, distracted by her mobile phone, failed to notice the approaching red light.

4. **14:28 (2:28 PM):** The Toyota Corolla collided with the Volvo V60 at a moderate speed, causing initial damage to both vehicles. Ms. Pitkänen's vehicle was pushed sideways into the intersection, disrupting the flow of traffic.

5. **14:28-14:30 (2:28-2:30 PM):** Subsequently, nine additional vehicles were involved in a chain reaction as they attempted to avoid the initial collision. These included a grey 2021 Ford Focus (FIN-789LM), driven by Ms. Laura Mäkelä from Joensuu; a red 2018 Honda Civic (FIN-ABCDE) driven by Mr. Samuli Rantanen from Kuopio; a blue 2022 Nissan Leaf (FIN-DEFGH) driven by Ms. Sanna Virtanen from Tampere; a silver 2019 BMW 3 Series (FIN-IJKLM) driven by Mr. Olli Miettinen from Helsinki; a green 2020 Audi A4 (FIN-NOPQRS) driven by Ms. Kaisa Hietala from Turku; a yellow 2017 Ford Fiesta (FIN-TUVWXY) driven by Mr. Jussi Kivinen from Lahti; a dark grey 2023 Dacia Sandero (FIN-YZA123) driven by Ms. Eeva Koskinen from Rovaniemi; and a burgundy 2015 Mercedes-Benz C-Class (FIN-456789) driven by Mr. Jouko Pekkarinen from Vaasa.

**Impact of Weather Conditions:**
The dry but cold weather contributed to the road surface being slick, exacerbating the severity of minor impacts and complicating recovery efforts for the involved vehicles. The lack of precipitation meant no hydroplaning effects, but the sub-zero temperatures made it challenging for emergency responders to manage spilled fluids and debris effectively.

**Vehicle Damage Descriptions:**

1. **Toyota Corolla (FIN-123XY):** Front end sustained significant damage, airbags deployed.
2. **Volvo V60 (FIN-456ZX):** Side panel dented, rear bumper scraped.

**Witness Statements:**
Multiple witnesses were interviewed at the scene, including passersby and individuals from nearby businesses. They corroborated the sequence of events, noting Ms. Pitkänen's apparent distraction just prior to the collision.

**Conclusion:**
The incident was primarily caused by driver inattention leading to a failure to adhere to traffic signals. The cold weather conditions contributed to increased stopping distances and slippery roads, compounding the situation. All drivers involved were issued warnings for careless driving, with Ms. Pitkänen facing additional charges due to the confirmed mobile phone usage at the time of the collision.
