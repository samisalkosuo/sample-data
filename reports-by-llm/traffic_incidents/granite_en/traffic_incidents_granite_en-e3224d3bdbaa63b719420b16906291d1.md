**Narrative:**

On the morning of 03.01.2024, at approximately 08:45, a four-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ruotsalanpuro in the municipality of Kuhmoinen, Finland. The incident involved a minor traffic accident under icy road conditions, resulting in no severe injuries but some property damage.

The vehicles involved were:
1. A silver 2019 Toyota Corolla, registered as FIN-123XY, driven by Ms. Anna Pietilä, a local teacher residing at Kauppakatu 45, Kuhmoinen.
2. A blue 2020 Ford Focus, registered as FIN-987AB, driven by Mr. Jussi Rantala, a construction worker from Ruotsalanpuro 12, Kuhmoinen.
3. A white 2018 Volkswagen Golf, registered as FIN-456YZ, driven by Ms. Laura Mäkelä, a student at the University of Eastern Finland, living on Kauppakatu 201, Kuhmoinen.
4. A grey 2017 Honda Civic, registered as FIN-321EF, driven by Mr. Samuli Koskinen, an IT specialist from Valtionpuro, Kuhmoinen.

According to witness statements and on-site investigations, Ms. Pietilä was traveling eastbound on Kauppakatu approaching the intersection with Ruotsalanpuro. Mr. Rantala, proceeding northbound on Ruotsalanpuro, attempted to turn left onto Kauppakatu but misjudged the speed and distance due to icy road conditions. Simultaneously, Ms. Mäkelä was heading eastbound on Kauppakatu and Mr. Koskinen was following her in the Volkswagen Golf.

As Mr. Rantala initiated his left turn, he collided with Ms. Mäkelä's Toyota Corolla first, pushing it into the path of Mr. Koskinen’s Honda Civic, which was unable to stop in time. The impact caused Ms. Mäkelä's vehicle to spin and come to a halt against the northeastern curb of the intersection. Mr. Koskinen's Civic sustained significant front-end damage, while Mr. Rantala’s Focus suffered damage to its right side and front bumper. Ms. Pietilä, traveling behind Mr. Koskinen, managed to brake successfully, avoiding a direct collision but scraping the southwestern curb of the intersection with her vehicle.

**Timeline:**

- 08:40: All vehicles reportedly traveling within speed limits for the icy conditions.
- 08:42: Mr. Rantala signals left turn on Ruotsalanpuro, approaching Kauppakatu intersection.
- 08:43: Ms. Mäkelä and Mr. Koskinen approach intersection from east on Kauppakatu.
- 08:44: Mr. Rantala begins left turn, misjudges distance due to icy roads.
- 08:45: Collision occurs between Mr. Rantala's Focus and Ms. Mäkelä's Corolla; Corolla is pushed into Koskinen’s path.
- 08:46: Koskinen's Civic collides with the Corolla; Pietilä scrapes curb attempting to avoid collision.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The roads were reported icy due to overnight freezing temperatures, contributing to reduced traction and increased stopping distances for all vehicles involved. Visibility was clear, but drivers were advised to exercise caution due to hazardous road conditions.

**Damage Descriptions:**

1. Ms. Mäkelä's Toyota Corolla: Front-end damage, airbags deployed; passenger (Ms. Mäkelä) reported minor whiplash.
2. Mr. Koskinen's Honda Civic: Significant front-end damage, driver uninjured.
3. Mr. Rantala's Ford Focus: Right side and front bumper damage; driver reported slight discomfort from seatbelt restraint.
4. Ms. Pietilä's Toyota Corolla: Scrapes along southwest curb; driver uninjured.

**Conclusion:**

All drivers were cooperative during the investigation, and no citations were issued immediately pending further review of dashcam footage (if available) and final medical assessments for any potential delayed injuries. The icy road conditions are considered a contributing factor to the misjudgment leading to this collision. All parties have been advised to file insurance claims accordingly, with recommendations for winter tire usage in similar weather conditions to enhance safety on local roads.
