**Narrative:**

On the morning of 06.03.2025, at approximately 08:45, a two-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ruotsalanpuro in Mynämäki, Finland. The drivers involved were identified as Jussi Kivinen, 42, residing at Hietaniemi 12, Mynämäki, operating a grey 2018 Volvo V60 with license plate 92-VHV-12, and Marko Rantala, 35, from the address of Kauppiakademi 34, Mynämäki, driving a blue 2016 Ford Focus with license plate 87-FRK-34.

Witnesses at the scene reported that both vehicles were traveling in opposite directions along their respective roads before approaching the intersection. According to eyewitness statements and preliminary investigations, Mr. Kivinen was proceeding north on Kauppakatu while Mr. Rantala was heading east on Ruotsalanpuro. As both drivers entered the intersection, Mr. Kivinen's Volvo allegedly failed to yield the right-of-way to Mr. Rantala’s Ford Focus, resulting in a collision.

**Timeline of Events:**

- 08:40 - Both vehicles approached the intersection from perpendicular directions.
- 08:42 - Mr. Kivinen entered the intersection without fully clearing it, causing his vehicle to make contact with Mr. Rantala's Ford Focus.
- 08:43 - Vehicles came to a stop after the impact, partially blocking the intersection.
- 08:45 - First responders arrived at the scene and initiated traffic management and investigation procedures.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

At the time of the incident, light rain was falling, contributing to slippery road conditions. The precipitation, combined with moderate wind speeds, reduced visibility slightly, potentially affecting driver perception and reaction times.

**Vehicle Damage:**

Upon inspection, Mr. Kivinen's Volvo V60 sustained damage primarily to the front passenger side, including a dented fender and scratches along the paneling. The airbag had deployed, indicating a moderate impact force. Mr. Rantala’s Ford Focus incurred damage to its front driver-side, with a crumpled hood and minor structural deformation.

**Summary:**

The collision appears to have resulted from a failure by Jussi Kivinen to yield the right-of-way at an intersection, exacerbated by light rain which may have affected road grip and visibility. Both drivers were transported to the nearest hospital for assessment of minor injuries; no serious or life-threatening conditions were reported. The investigation is ongoing to determine if additional factors contributed to the incident, including a review of any potential mechanical issues or driver distraction. Further analysis will include examination of vehicle event data recorders (black boxes) and interviews with involved parties.
