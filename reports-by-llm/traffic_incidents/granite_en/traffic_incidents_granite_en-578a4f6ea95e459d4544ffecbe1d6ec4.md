**Narrative:**

On the morning of 09.03.2023, at approximately 08:45, a two-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ratinkatu in the municipality of Lieto, Finland. The vehicles involved were a grey 2018 Toyota Corolla, registered as LI-1234, driven by Mr. Mikko Koskinen, 34, of Kauppakatu 56, and a blue 2020 Ford Focus, registered as LI-5678, operated by Ms. Anna Pitkänen, 29, of Ratinkatu 112.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **08:30**: Mixed snow and rain began falling in Lieto, creating slippery road conditions.
- **08:35**: Mr. Koskinen was driving eastbound on Kauppakatu towards the intersection with Ratinkatu.
- **08:40**: Ms. Pitkänen was traveling southbound on Ratinkatu approaching the same intersection.
- **08:45**: Both vehicles entered the intersection simultaneously. Mr. Koskinen proceeded through a green light, while Ms. Pitkänen, despite having a cautionary yellow light, attempted to navigate the intersection. The front passenger side of the Corolla collided with the driver's side of the Focus.
- **08:46**: Witnesses, including Ms. Laura Mäkelä, a local shopkeeper at Kauppakatu 50, and Mr. Olli Virtanen, a passerby on Ratinkatu, immediately stopped to assist. They reported that both drivers exited their vehicles unharmed but visibly shaken.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The prevailing weather conditions at the time of the incident were mixed snow and rain, reducing visibility and creating slick road surfaces. The combination of wet asphalt and freshly fallen slush contributed to the loss of traction for Ms. Pitkänen as she entered the intersection on a yellow light.

**Vehicle Damage:**

- The Toyota Corolla, driven by Mr. Koskinen, sustained damage to its front passenger side, including a dented fender and scratches along the door.
- The Ford Focus, operated by Ms. Pitkänen, incurred damage to its driver's side, evidenced by a crumpled door and scrapes down the paneling.

**Witness Statements:**

Ms. Mäkelä confirmed that both drivers appeared sober and cooperative. She noted that neither party seemed to be in distress beyond the shock of the collision. Mr. Virtanen corroborated her account, stating that he observed no signs of erratic driving leading up to the incident.

**Conclusion:**

The collision was attributed to adverse weather conditions and a misjudgment by Ms. Pitkänen regarding the timing of the traffic signal. No citations were issued at the scene, but both drivers were advised to review their driving practices in such conditions. The incident serves as a reminder for all motorists to adjust their speed and anticipate potential hazards during mixed precipitation events.
