2. **14:25 hours:** As Ms. Kivinen neared the intersection, she reduced her speed in accordance with the posted limit of 40 km/h due to mixed snow and rain conditions affecting visibility and road grip.

3. **14:28 hours:** Mr. Pitkäranta continued at a moderate speed, unaware that Ms. Kivinen had slowed down. The approaching vehicles were within close proximity as they entered the intersection.

4. **14:30 hours:** The collision occurred when the front passenger side of Mr. Pitkäranten's Volvo made contact with the driver’s side of Ms. Kivinen's Corolla. Both drivers applied their brakes immediately post-impact, but skidding ensued due to the slippery road conditions caused by the mixture of snow and rain.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The prevailing weather at the time of the incident was mixed snow and light rain, reducing visibility and creating hazardous driving conditions. The roads were damp with patches of slush, contributing to decreased traction for both vehicles involved.

**Report Conclusion:**

This report details a two-vehicle collision in Juuka, Finland, under mixed snow and rain conditions on 10th June 2025.
