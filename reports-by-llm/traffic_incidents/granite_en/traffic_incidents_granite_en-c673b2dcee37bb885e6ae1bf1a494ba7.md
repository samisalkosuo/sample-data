**Narrative:**

On the evening of 21 October 2024, at approximately 21:30 hours, a two-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ruotsalanmäki in the municipality of Vihti, Finland. The drivers involved were identified as Mikko Pietilä, a 34-year-old local resident, operating a silver 2019 Toyota Corolla with license plate 87-AJK-12, and Anna Koskinen, a 28-year-old residing in Helsinki, driving a blue 2020 Ford Focus bearing the license plate number 56-BCD-34.

According to witness statements from passersby, Mr. Pietilä was traveling westbound on Kauppakatu approaching the intersection with Ruotsalanmäki. Ms. Koskinen was proceeding northbound along Ruotsalanmäki intending to turn left onto Kauppakatu. The overcast weather conditions, with reduced visibility, likely contributed to misjudging each other's speed and intentions.

As Mr. Pietilä entered the intersection, Ms. Koskinen initiated her left turn directly in front of the oncoming Corolla. Despite applying brakes, Mr. Pietilä was unable to avoid a collision. The front passenger side of the Corolla struck the driver's side front of the Focus, causing significant damage to both vehicles.

- 21:29 hours: Mr. Pietilä, traveling at the speed limit of 50 km/h, approaches the intersection from the west.
- 21:30 hours: Ms. Koskinen signals her intent to turn left and begins her maneuver.
- 21:31 hours: Mr. Pietilä observes Ms. Koskinen's signal but misjudges her speed due to the overcast conditions, failing to fully decelerate.
- 21:32 hours: Collision occurs as described above.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The prevailing weather at the time of the incident was overcast with reduced visibility, likely impairing both drivers' ability to accurately assess each other's speed and intentions. The road surface was dry but lacked the enhanced visibility offered by clear skies, contributing to the misjudgment leading to the collision.

**Vehicle Damage:**

The Toyota Corolla sustained damage primarily to its front passenger side, including a crumpled fender and a dented door. The airbags deployed during the impact, indicating a moderate force of collision. 

The Ford Focus suffered damage to its driver's side front, with a bent hood, scrapes along the front bumper, and a damaged headlight. 

**Injuries:**

Both drivers reported minor injuries consistent with seatbelt usage. They were transported to Vihti Central Hospital for evaluation and subsequent release without requiring further treatment.

**Witnesses:**

Two witnesses, local residents Jari Mäkelä and Sanna Rautio, provided statements confirming the events as described above. Their accounts corroborate the sequence of events leading to the collision.

This report is submitted for further investigation and potential insurance claims processing. Further inquiries should be directed to Inspector Jouko Hietala at the Vihti Police Department.
