**Narrative:**

On the morning of 03.07.2024, at approximately 08:45, a two-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ratinauksenmäki in Taivalkoski, Finland. The drivers involved were Mr. Mikko Hietala, 34, residing at Kauppakatu 12, and Ms. Anna-Liisa Korhonen, 29, from Ratinauksenmäki 5.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **08:30 AM:** Heavy rain commenced in Taivalkoski, reducing visibility and creating slippery road conditions on Kauppakatu and Ratinauksenmäki.

- **08:40 AM:** Mr. Hietala, driving a 2018 Volvo V60 with Finnish license plate 123-AB-45, proceeded northbound on Kauppakatu towards the intersection intending to turn left onto Ratinauksenmäki.

- **08:42 AM:** Ms. Korhonen, operating a 2020 Toyota Corolla with Finnish license plate 678-XY-90, was traveling southbound on Kauppakatu, approaching the same intersection. She was en route to drop off her child at the nearby Taivalkoski Daycare Center located at Ratinauksenmäki 3.

- **08:45 AM:** As Mr. Hietala prepared to make his left turn, Ms. Korhonen, maintaining a speed within the posted limit of 50 km/h, encountered reduced traction due to the heavy rain. She was unable to bring her vehicle to a complete stop before reaching the intersection, colliding with Mr. Hietala's Volvo as he began his turn.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The prevailing weather conditions were heavy rainfall, significantly impairing visibility and creating wet road surfaces. The combination of these factors contributed to the reduced traction experienced by both drivers, ultimately leading to the collision.

**Vehicle Damage:**

- Mr. Hietala's Volvo V60 sustained damage primarily to the passenger side, including a dented door, a broken headlight, and scratches along the vehicle’s flank. The airbag deployed during the impact.

- Ms. Korhonen's Toyota Corolla incurred front-end damage, with the front bumper and grille collapsed upon impact. Airbag deployment was also noted in this vehicle.

**Witnesses:**

Two passersby, Mr. Jussi Rantala and Ms. Leena Virtanen, witnessed the incident and provided statements to the reporting officer. They confirmed that both vehicles were moving at moderate speeds prior to the collision and noted the challenging weather conditions.

**Conclusion:**

The collision was determined to be an accident resulting from adverse weather conditions exacerbating normal driving maneuvers. Both drivers acted prudently under the circumstances, but the heavy rain significantly impacted their ability to maintain control of their vehicles. No criminal charges were warranted, and both parties agreed to handle any insurance claims directly.
