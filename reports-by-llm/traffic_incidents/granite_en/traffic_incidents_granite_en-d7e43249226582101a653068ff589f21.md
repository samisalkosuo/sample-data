*Date of Incident:* 25th October 2023  
*Location:* Maalahti, Finland  
*Reporting Officer:* Inspector Jari Hietala  
*Municipality:* Maalahti  

**Incident Description:**

On the morning of 25th October 2023, at approximately 08:45 hours, a three-vehicle traffic incident occurred on Kauppakatu, a primary road in the municipality of Maalahti, Finland. The weather conditions were snowy, with light snowfall reducing visibility and creating slippery road surfaces.

**Vehicles Involved:**

1. **Driver A**: Mikael Kivinen, 42 years old, residing at Kauppakatu 100, Maalahti. Driving a silver 2019 Volvo V60 with Finnish license plate 123-ABC.

2. **Driver B**: Anna Pietilä, 35 years old, residing at Kauppakatu 200, Maalahti. Operating a blue 2017 Toyota Corolla bearing the license plate 456-DEF.

3. **Driver C**: Olli Rantala, 58 years old, residing at Kauppakatu 300, Maalahti. In control of a red 2015 Ford Focus with license plate 789-GHI.

**Timeline of Events:**

- At approximately 08:40 hours, Driver A was proceeding northbound on Kauppakatu towards the town center.
- Driver B, traveling southbound in the opposite direction, encountered a patch of black ice, causing her vehicle to skid and drift into the oncoming lane.
- Simultaneously, Driver C, following closely behind Driver B, was unable to react in time due to reduced visibility from the snowfall and attempted to avoid a collision by steering sharply but collided with Driver B's vehicle.
- The impact of this secondary collision propelled Driver B’s vehicle into the path of Driver A, resulting in a three-vehicle collision.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The roads were covered with a light layer of fresh snow, which, combined with the early morning temperatures just above freezing, created hazardous conditions. Visibility was moderately reduced due to the falling snow, contributing to the drivers' inability to maintain control of their vehicles.

**Damage Assessment:**

- Driver A's Volvo V60 sustained damage primarily to the front passenger side, with significant scraping and a dented fender. The airbags deployed during the impact.
- Driver B's Toyota Corolla incurred damage to both the front and driver’s side, including a crumpled hood and a bent door. The vehicle was disabled and required towing.
- Driver C's Ford Focus suffered damage to the rear passenger side, with a broken tail light and a scraped rear quarter panel.

**Witness Statements:**

A passerby, Johanna Lehtinen, provided a statement confirming she saw the initial skid by Driver B and the subsequent chain reaction involving Drivers A and C. Another witness, Pekka Niemi, who was waiting at a nearby bus stop, reported hearing screeching tires and the sound of impact before rushing to assist.

**Conclusion:**

The incident appears to be a result of adverse weather conditions exacerbated by the early morning hours, leading to reduced visibility and slippery roads. All drivers were within the speed limits for the area, but the unexpected ice patch triggered a series of reactions that culminated in this multi-vehicle collision. No serious injuries were reported, with all parties involved sustaining minor cuts and bruises.
