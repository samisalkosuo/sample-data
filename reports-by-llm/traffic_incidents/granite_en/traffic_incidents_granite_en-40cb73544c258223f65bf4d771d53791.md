**Narrative:**

On the afternoon of 25.03.2024, at approximately 14:30 hours, a multi-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ruotsalanpuro in Luumäki, Finland. The incident involved ten vehicles, resulting in various degrees of damage and minor injuries to the drivers and passengers.

The primary cause of the accident appears to be heavy rainfall, which significantly reduced visibility and contributed to slippery road conditions. At the time, it was raining heavily, with water accumulating rapidly on the streets due to insufficient drainage in some areas. This adverse weather condition, combined with the high volume of traffic during peak daytime hours, created challenging driving conditions.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **14:20 hours:** Heavy rainfall commences in Luumäki, causing water to pool on roads, particularly at lower-lying intersections like Kauppakatu and Ruotsalanpuro.

- **14:25 hours:** A red 2018 Toyota Corolla, driven by Mr. Mikko Koskinen, 34, of Vantaa, Finland (license plate 92-ABC-12), approaches the intersection from Ruotsalanpuro heading north towards Kauppakatu.

- **14:28 hours:** A silver 2020 Volkswagen Golf, driven by Ms. Sanna Pitkäranta, 27, of Espoo, Finland (license plate 34-DEF-56), travels south on Kauppakatu towards Ruotsalanpuro. The driver reports reduced visibility due to heavy rain and standing water obscuring road markings.

- **14:29 hours:** As Ms. Pitkäranta proceeds cautiously through the intersection, Mr. Koskinen, misjudging the speed and distance due to poor visibility, attempts to turn left onto Kauppakatu. The vehicles collide, setting off a chain reaction involving nine other vehicles waiting or passing through the intersection.

- **14:30 hours:** The collision occurs, with Mr. Koskinen's Toyota Corolla striking Ms. Pitkäranta’s Volkswagen Golf, followed by subsequent impacts between the involved vehicles. Witnesses report that several cars were pushed into each other, sustaining damage ranging from minor scratches to significant structural harm.

**Witness Statements:**

- **Ms. Aino Mäkelä, 45, a local resident of Kauppakatu**, witnessed the initial collision and described the heavy rain as "extremely disorienting." She noted that several vehicles were unable to stop in time due to the slippery conditions.

- **Mr. Jussi Rantanen, 52, a passerby on foot**, was caught in the rain near the intersection and observed that the road surface was "completely awash," contributing to the drivers' difficulty in maintaining control.
