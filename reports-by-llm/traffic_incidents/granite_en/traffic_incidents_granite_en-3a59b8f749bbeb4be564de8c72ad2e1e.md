**Narrative:**

On the morning of 12th September 2023, at approximately 08:45 hours, a multi-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Metsäntie in Kiuruvesi, Finland. The incident involved five vehicles under snowy weather conditions, which significantly impacted visibility and road traction.

The primary vehicles involved were:

1. A white 2018 Volvo V60, registered KY-12345, driven by Mr. Mikko Koskinen, 34, of Kauppakatu 12, Kiuruvesi. Mr. Koskinen was traveling southbound on Kauppakatu approaching the intersection.

2. A grey 2020 Toyota Corolla, registered LI-67890, driven by Ms. Anna Pitkänen, 29, of Metsäntie 56, Kiuruvesi. Ms. Pitkänen was proceeding westbound on Metsäntie towards the intersection.

3. A black 2017 Ford Focus, registered JO-23456, driven by Mr. Olli Mäkelä, 45, of Kauppakatu 34, Kiuruvesi. Mr. Mäkelä was following the Volvo on Kauppakatu.

4. A silver 2019 Honda Civic, registered RE-78901, driven by Ms. Sanna Rantala, 31, of Metsäntie 21, Kiuruvesi. Ms. Rantala was behind the Toyota Corolla on Metsäntie.

5. A red 2016 Nissan Qashqai, registered UU-34567, driven by Mr. Jussi Kivinen, 50, of Kauppakatu 9, Kiuruvesi. Mr. Kivinen was approaching the intersection from a side street on Metsäntie.

**Timeline of Events:**

- At 08:42 hours, Ms. Pitkänen initiated a left turn from Metsäntie onto Kauppakatu intending to head southbound in the direction of Mr. Koskinen's Volvo.

- Simultaneously, at 08:43 hours, Mr. Mäkelä in the Ford Focus was following closely behind Mr. Koskinen’s Volvo as they approached the intersection.

- Ms. Rantala in the Honda Civic, traveling westbound on Metsäntie, was approximately 50 meters behind Ms. Pitkänen's Toyota.

- Mr. Kivinen, driving the Nissan Qashqai, entered the intersection from the northern side street without adequately yielding to oncoming traffic due to reduced visibility caused by the snowfall.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The morning was characterized by light snowfall, reducing road visibility and creating slippery conditions. The snow had accumulated unevenly on the roads, particularly at intersections, contributing to the loss of traction for the vehicles involved.

**Damage Descriptions:**

- The Volvo V60 sustained damage to its front passenger side, including a dented fender and scratches along the door.

- The Toyota Corolla experienced significant damage to its rear driver's side, with a crumpled quarter panel and broken taillight.

- The Ford Focus had minor scuffing on its rear bumper from contact with the Volvo during the collision sequence.

- The Honda Civic suffered front-end damage, including a bent hood and impaired headlight functionality due to impact with the Toyota Corolla.

- The Nissan Qashqai incurred considerable damage to its right side, with a broken headlight and substantial dents along the passenger door.

**Witness Statements:**

Several pedestrians near the scene reported seeing Ms. Pitkänen initiate her turn without fully clearing oncoming traffic, while Mr. Kivinen was noted to have entered the intersection at an unsafe speed for conditions. No witnesses reported any braking sounds prior to the collisions, suggesting possible loss of control due to road conditions.

**Conclusion:**

The collision appears to be a result of a chain reaction initiated by Ms. Pitkänen's failure to yield and Mr. Kivinen's excessive speed under snowy conditions. All drivers are being summoned for questioning, and further investigation will include analysis of vehicle black boxes to reconstruct the sequence of events accurately. Charges including careless driving and potential violations of Finnish Road Traffic Act are under consideration based on preliminary findings.
