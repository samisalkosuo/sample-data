**Timeline of Events:**

- At approximately 21:38 hours, Mr. Mikko Koskinen was proceeding north on Kauppakatu towards the intersection intending to turn left onto Rannikko.
- Ms. Anna Pitkänen, traveling south on Kauppakatu in her Toyota Corolla, approached the intersection with Mr. Koskinen.
- Simultaneously, Mr. Jussi Laine in his Ford Focus was heading east along Rannikko, intending to turn left onto Kauppakatu.
- Ms. Sanna Rautio, driving west on Rannikko, was preparing to turn right onto Kauppakatu.
- Mr. Olli Miettinen, traveling south on Kauppakatu in his Audi A4, was following Ms. Pitkänen closely.
- Ms. Eeva Kivinen, in her Nissan Qashqai, approached the intersection from the opposite direction on Rannikko, intending to turn left onto Kauppakatu.
- Mr. Teppo Lehtinen, driving his BMW X1 eastward on Rannikko, was also preparing to turn left onto Kauppakatu.

As all vehicles approached the intersection under wet and slippery road conditions, a chain reaction ensued:

- Mr. Koskinen's Volvo began its left turn but lost traction on the slick pavement, colliding with Ms. Pitkänen’s Corolla.
- The impact propelled Ms. Pitkänen’s vehicle into Mr. Laine’s Ford Focus, which was also attempting a left turn from Rannikko onto Kauppakatu.
- Ms. Rautio's Honda Civic, attempting to turn right onto Kauppakatu, was struck by debris and partially pushed into the path of Mr. Miettinen’s Audi.
- The Audi collided with the rear of Ms. Rautio's vehicle, causing it to strike Mr. Lehtinen’s BMW X1, which was attempting a left turn at the same time.
- Ms. Kivinen's Nissan Qashqai, caught in the chaos, swerved to avoid collision but struck a traffic sign, sustaining minor damage.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The roads were wet and slippery due to recent rainfall, contributing significantly to the loss of vehicle control experienced by the drivers involved. Visibility was moderately reduced by streetlights and passing vehicles, complicating the situation further.

**Vehicle Damages:**

1. Mr. Koskinen's Volvo V60 sustained damage to the front passenger side, including a bent fender and scratches along the door.
2. Ms. Pitkänen's Toyota Corolla had significant front-end damage, with the hood crumpled and headlight shattered.

4. Ms. Rautio's Honda Civic incurred damage to its right front fender and minor scratches on the side.
5. Mr. Miettinen's Audi A4 showed impact marks on the rear bumper and slight paint transfer from contact with other vehicles.
6. Ms. Kivinen's Nissan Qashqai had a damaged front bumper from its collision with a traffic sign.
7. Mr. Lehtinen's BMW X1 bore scratches on its left side panel due to the impact with Ms. Rautio’s vehicle.

**Witness Statements:**

Several pedestrians in the vicinity provided consistent accounts of the events, noting the rapid succession of collisions and the slippery road conditions. A nearby security camera captured footage corroborating witness testimonies.

**Conclusion:**

The collision was a result of a complex interplay of factors including driver error exacerbated by adverse weather conditions. All drivers involved were cited for failing to maintain safe following distances and for not adjusting their driving to the prevailing road conditions.
