**Narrative:**

On the afternoon of 19 January 2025, at approximately 14:30 hours, a three-vehicle traffic incident occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ruotsalanpuro in Siikalatva. The vehicles involved were operated by the following individuals:

1. **Driver A:** Mikael Korhonen, 42 years old, residing at Kauppakatu 56, Siikalatva. He was driving a white 2018 Volvo V60 with Finnish license plate 123-AB-45.
2. **Driver B:** Anna-Liisa Pitkänen, 31 years old, residing at Ruotsalanpuro 29, Siikalatva. She was operating a blue 2016 Toyota Corolla with Finnish license plate 678-XY-90.
3. **Driver C:** Olli Miettinen, 54 years old, residing at Kauppakatu 101, Siikalatva. He was in control of a grey 2012 Ford Focus with Finnish license plate 345-EF-67.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **14:28 hours:** Driver A, Mikael Korhonen, was traveling southbound on Kauppakatu approaching the intersection with Ruotsalanpuro. Driver B, Anna-Liisa Pitkänen, was proceeding westbound on Ruotsalanpuro, intending to turn left onto Kauppakatu. Driver C, Olli Miettinen, was heading northbound on Kauppakatu.

- **14:29 hours:** As Driver B entered the intersection, she failed to yield to oncoming traffic, colliding with Driver A's Volvo at approximately the center of the crossroads. The impact caused significant frontal damage to both vehicles.

- **14:30 hours:** Driver C, approaching the intersection, observed the collision unfolding and attempted to brake but was unable to prevent his Ford Focus from striking the rear of Driver B's Toyota Corolla, pushing it further into the Volvo.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The incident took place under snowy weather conditions. Light snowfall had accumulated on the roads, reducing visibility and creating slippery surfaces. The road was not treated with salt or grit, contributing to reduced traction for all vehicles involved.

**Vehicle Damages:**

- **Volvo V60 (Driver A):** Sustained substantial frontal damage, including a crumpled hood and damaged headlights. Airbags deployed during the collision.
- **Toyota Corolla (Driver B):** Experienced severe front-end impact, with the left side heavily dented and the driver's side airbag having discharged.
- **Ford Focus (Driver C):** Rear-end damage, with the trunk lid caved in and taillights shattered. No airbags deployed as the vehicle was not struck in a manner that triggered them.

**Witness Statements:**

Several passersby witnessed the incident and provided statements to the police. Notably, a local resident, Marko Lehtinen from Kauppakatu 78, reported seeing Driver B fail to yield and proceed into the intersection without checking for oncoming traffic.

**Investigation Outcome:**

Driver B, Anna-Liisa Pitkänen, was found to be at fault for failing to yield right of way, leading to the initial collision. Subsequently, this triggered a chain reaction involving Driver C's vehicle. All drivers were cited accordingly, and no serious injuries were reported, though minor injuries were sustained by the drivers involved.
