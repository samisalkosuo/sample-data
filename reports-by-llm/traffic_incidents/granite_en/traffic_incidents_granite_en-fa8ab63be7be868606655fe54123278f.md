**Traffic Incident Report**

*Incident Number:* 2025-SIP-0728  
*Date of Incident:* 28th July 2025  
*Location:* Intersection of Kauppakatu and Ruotsalanpuro, Sipoo, Finland  
*Reporting Officer:* Inspector Jouko Hietala, Sipoo Police Department  

**Narrative:**

On the evening of 28th July 2025, at approximately 17:45 hours, a two-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ruotsalanpuro in the municipality of Sipoo, Finland. The incident involved a white 2019 Toyota Corolla, registered with the license plate '123-ABC', driven by Mr. Mikko Kivinen, a 45-year-old local resident of Kauppakatu 56, and a grey 2020 Ford Focus, registered with the license plate '456-DEF', operated by Ms. Anna Pitkänen, a 31-year-old residing at Ruotsalanpuro 12.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **17:30 hours:** Ms. Pitkänen, driving her Ford Focus from the south on Ruotsalanpuro towards the intersection, encountered snow-covered roads typical of the Finnish winter conditions persisting into summer due to an unseasonal weather anomaly.

- **17:35 hours:** Mr. Kivinen, proceeding north on Kauppakatu in his Toyota Corolla, approached the intersection intending to turn left onto Ruotsalanpuro. Visibility was reduced due to light snowfall, and road conditions were slippery from accumulated snow.

- **17:40 hours:** As Ms. Pitkänen entered the intersection, her vehicle's traction was compromised by the snow, causing a loss of control. She attempted to correct but was unable to avoid colliding with Mr. Kivinen’s vehicle as it turned left in front of her path.

- **17:45 hours:** The collision occurred at the northwest quadrant of the intersection, resulting in significant damage to both vehicles. The Corolla sustained substantial front-end damage, including a crumpled hood and damaged headlights, while the Focus suffered considerable side impact damage, affecting the passenger door and rear quarter panel.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The prevailing weather condition at the time of the incident was snowfall, with roads covered in a thin layer of fresh snow. The combination of reduced visibility and slippery surfaces contributed to Ms. Pitkänen losing control of her vehicle. Local authorities were alerted to the hazardous conditions and dispatched salt and plow units to Ruotsalanpuro and Kauppakatu shortly after the incident to improve road safety for subsequent traffic.

**Damage Descriptions:**

- **Toyota Corolla (123-ABC):** Frontal damage included a dented hood, bent headlight assemblies, and scrapes along the passenger side from contact with the Focus. Airbag deployment was noted, indicating occupant restraint during the collision.

- **Ford Focus (456-DEF):** The driver's side suffered significant impact, with a crumpled door, damaged rear quarter panel, and misaligned chassis components. No immediate signs of passenger injury were reported by Ms. Pitkänen.

**Witnesses:**

Two pedestrians, Mr. Jari Lehtinen and Ms. Laura Mäkelä, walking their dogs on adjacent sidewalks, witnessed the incident and provided statements corroborating the described sequence of events. They also reported that both drivers appeared shaken but uninjured immediately post-collision.

**Action Taken:**

Emergency medical services were summoned to the scene, assessing both drivers for injuries. Neither Mr. Kivinen nor Ms. Pitkänen required hospitalization and declined transport. Both vehicles were towed to a secure yard for storage pending insurance claims and further investigation into potential contributing factors such as vehicle maintenance records and driver history.

This report is submitted for review and further action in accordance with standard operating procedures of the Sipoo Police Department. Further inquiries can be directed to Inspector Jouko Hietala at the contact details provided below.
