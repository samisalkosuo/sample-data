**Traffic Incident Report**

*Incident Number:* 230819-FIN-KET-001  
*Date of Incident:* 19 August 2023  
*Location:* Intersection of Kauppakatu and Ruotsalanpuro, Keitele, Finland  
*Reporting Officer:* Inspector Jari Hietala  
*Municipality:* Keitele  

**Narrative:**

On the evening of 19 August 2023, at approximately 21:45 hours, a three-vehicle traffic incident occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ruotsalanpuro in the municipality of Keitele, Finland. The primary contributing factors were icy road conditions and driver error.

The vehicles involved were a silver 2019 Toyota Corolla, registered as FIN-123XY, driven by Mr. Mikko Koskinen, 34, of Ruotsalanpuro 12; a blue 2020 Ford Focus, identified with license plate FIN-456AB, operated by Ms. Sanna Pietilä, 28, from Kauppakatu 45; and a grey 2017 Volkswagen Passat, bearing the registration FIN-789CD, driven by Mr. Jussi Rantala, 42, residing at Kauppakatu 99.

According to witness statements and on-scene evidence, Ms. Pietilä was traveling southbound on Kauppakatu approaching the intersection with Ruotsalanpuro. Mr. Koskinen, proceeding westbound on Ruotsalanpuro, attempted to turn left across Ms. Pietilä's path. Simultaneously, Mr. Rantala was traveling eastbound on Kauppakatu and collided with the rear of Ms. Pietilä’s vehicle as she slowed for the turning Corolla.

The sequence of events, corroborated by CCTV footage from a nearby business, indicates that Mr. Koskinen failed to yield the right-of-way, leading to the initial braking action by Ms. Pietilä. This sudden deceleration was insufficient to prevent the subsequent collision with Mr. Rantala's vehicle.

**Timeline of Events:**

- 21:40 hours: Icy road conditions reported across Keitele, including Kauppakatu and Ruotsalanpuro.
- 21:43 hours: Ms. Pietilä’s Ford Focus enters the intersection from the south, proceeding cautiously due to icy roads.
- 21:44 hours: Mr. Koskinen's Toyota Corolla initiates a left turn across Ms. Pietilä's path without yielding.
- 21:44:30 hours: Ms. Pietilä applies brakes to avoid collision, causing her vehicle to skid on the icy surface.
- 21:44:35 hours: Mr. Rantala’s Volkswagen Passat, following closely behind Ms. Pietilä, collides with the rear of her Ford Focus.
- 21:44:40 hours: All vehicles come to a stop in a disarrayed fashion across the intersection.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The roads were reported icy due to overnight freezing temperatures following rainfall earlier in the day, contributing to reduced traction and increased stopping distances for all drivers involved. Visibility was clear, but the slippery conditions posed significant challenges for maintaining control of their vehicles.

**Vehicle Damage:**

- Ms. Pietilä's Ford Focus sustained damage to the front passenger side, including a dented fender and scratches along the paneling. The airbag deployment indicated a minor impact to the driver’s seat.
- Mr. Rantala's Volkswagen Passat showed significant rear-end damage, with the bumper crumpled and taillight assembly shattered. Airbag deployment was noted in the driver’s seat as well.
- Mr. Koskinen's Toyota Corolla exhibited damage to the left front side, including a bent hood and scrapes along the driver’s side door, suggesting the vehicle was struck while making the turning maneuver.

**Witness Statements:**

Multiple witnesses, including passersby and employees from adjacent businesses, provided consistent accounts of the events leading up to the collision. They noted Mr. Koskinen's failure to check for oncoming traffic before initiating his turn and described Ms. Pietilä’s cautious approach through the icy intersection.

**Conclusion:**

The incident was primarily caused by driver negligence under hazardous weather conditions. Mr. Koskinen's failure to yield the right-of-way, compounded by icy road surfaces, resulted in a chain reaction leading to the collision involving Ms. Pietilä and Mr. Rantala. All drivers were cited for violations related to their actions contributing to the incident, with additional warnings issued regarding driving in adverse weather conditions.
