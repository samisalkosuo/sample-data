**Narrative:**

On the evening of 08.06.2023, at approximately 21:45 hours, a two-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Pohjoiskupraatin and Kauppakatu in the municipality of Kurikka, Finland. The incident involved a white 2018 Toyota Corolla, registered with the license plate 34-KUR-12, driven by Mr. Mikko Hietala, a 35-year-old local resident, and a silver 2020 Ford Focus, identified by its license plate 78-KRI-92, operated by Ms. Anna Kaski, a 29-year-old resident of nearby Riihimäki.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **21:40 hours:** Mr. Hietala, driving westbound on Pohjoiskupraatin towards the intersection with Kauppakatu, encountered snow-covered roads typical of Finland's late spring conditions. Visibility was reduced due to falling snowflakes, which had accumulated over the previous hour.

- **21:43 hours:** Ms. Kaski, traveling southbound on Kauppakatu approaching Pohjoiskupraatin, also faced challenging driving conditions. The snowfall was moderate, and road markings were partially obscured.

- **21:44 hours:** As Mr. Hietala neared the intersection, he proceeded without noticing Ms. Kaski's vehicle due to reduced visibility. Both drivers failed to adhere strictly to the required caution given the weather conditions.

- **21:45 hours:** The collision occurred when Mr. Hietala's Toyota Corolla, entering the intersection, was struck on its passenger side by Ms. Kaski's Ford Focus, which was traveling through the intersection on a green light but misjudged the speed of oncoming traffic.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The weather at the time of the incident was snowy with moderate snowfall. Roads were covered in a thin layer of fresh snow, reducing traction and visibility. Streetlights were partially obscured by accumulating snow, further complicating drivers' ability to discern traffic signals and road markings clearly.

**Vehicle Damage:**

The Toyota Corolla sustained damage primarily to its passenger side, including a dented door, scratches along the side panel, and a damaged headlight. The Ford Focus incurred front-end damage, with a crumpled hood and minor scuffs on the driver's side. Both vehicles were towed from the scene for inspection and repair.

**Witnesses:**

Two passersby, Mr. Jussi Rantala and Ms. Leena Virtanen, witnessed the incident and provided statements corroborating the described sequence of events. They noted that both drivers appeared shaken but uninjured following the collision.

**Action Taken:**

Emergency services were promptly dispatched to the scene. Both drivers were assessed for injuries and found to be stable, declining medical transport. The area was cleared of debris, and temporary road signs were erected to warn other motorists of potential hazardous conditions due to ongoing snowfall.

This report is submitted for further investigation and insurance claims processing. Further inquiries should be directed to Kurikkapoliti Jari Pitkäranta at the Kurikka Police Station.
