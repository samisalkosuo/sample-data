**Narrative:**

On the afternoon of 21 August 2023, at approximately 14:15 hours, a three-vehicle traffic incident occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ristimäenkangas in Puumala, Finland. The vehicles involved were a silver 2018 Toyota Corolla, registered as '123-PUU', driven by Mr. Mikko Hietanen, 34, of Kauppakatu 56; a blue 2020 Ford Focus, registered as '456-PUU', operated by Ms. Sanna Pitkänen, 29, residing at Ristimäenkangas 12; and a grey 2017 Volvo V60, identified with the registration '789-PUU', driven by Mr. Jussi Kivinen, 45, from Tietomäki 34.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **14:10 hours:** Ms. Pitkänen, driving her Ford Focus eastbound on Ristimäenkangas, approached the intersection intending to turn left onto Kauppakatu. Mr. Hietanen, in his Corolla, was traveling southbound along Kauppakatu towards the same intersection.
- **14:12 hours:** Mr. Kivinen, driving his Volvo V60 westbound on Kauppakatu, neared the intersection intending to turn right onto Ristimäenkangas. Windy conditions with gusts, as reported by local weather station Puumala-Vesijärvi (27 km southwest), contributed to reduced visibility and challenging driving conditions.
- **14:13 hours:** As Ms. Pitkänen prepared to turn left, she misjudged the speed of Mr. Hietanen's approaching vehicle. Simultaneously, Mr. Kivinen, encountering difficulties due to wind gusts affecting his Volvo’s stability, failed to fully stop before turning right onto Ristimäenkangas.
- **14:14 hours:** The Ford Focus and Toyota Corolla collided in the intersection, with the front passenger side of the Focus impacting the driver's side of the Corolla. The force of this initial collision propelled Mr. Hietanen’s vehicle into a nearby parked car, causing minor damage. Meanwhile, Mr. Kivinen's Volvo struck the Ford Focus on its rear passenger side, pushing it further into the intersection.
- **14:15 hours:** All vehicles came to rest, with the Corolla and Focus exhibiting significant frontal damage, while the Volvo sustained considerable right-side impacts. No serious injuries were reported among the drivers or passengers involved, though minor cuts and bruises were noted.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

Throughout the incident, windy conditions with gusts, as per meteorological data from Puumala-Vesijärvi, played a crucial role in the accident. The gusts affected vehicle stability, particularly for Mr. Kivinen, who was turning right onto Ristimäenkangas. Reduced visibility due to wind-blown debris and momentary obscuring of headlights contributed to misjudgments by both Ms. Pitkänen and Mr. Hietanen.

**Vehicle Details:**

1. **Toyota Corolla (Silver, 2018):** Driven by Mikko Hietanen, registered '123-PUU'. Sustained damage to the front passenger side and driver's side door.
2. **Ford Focus (Blue, 2020):** Operated by Sanna Pitkänen, registered '456-PUU'. Experienced significant frontal impacts, affecting both driver’s and passenger’s sides.
3. **Volvo V60 (Grey, 2017):** Driven by Jussi Kivinen, registered '789-PUU'. Sustained damage to the right rear side and front passenger area from impact with the Ford Focus.

**Witness Statements:**

Several pedestrians corroborated the sequence of events, noting the windy conditions and the difficulty drivers faced in maneuvering through the intersection. A local resident, Ms. Leena Rantala, provided a detailed account of seeing Mr. Kivinen's vehicle swerve slightly before the collision, attributing this to the gusts affecting his control.

**Conclusion:**

The traffic incident at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ristimäenkangas on 21 August 2023 was primarily caused by adverse weather conditions—specifically windy gusts—impacting driver visibility and vehicle stability. All parties involved were cooperative, and no criminal charges were warranted given the circumstances. Recommendations for improved road signage and potential windbreak installations at this intersection have been forwarded to local authorities for consideration.
