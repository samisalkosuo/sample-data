**Narrative:**

On the night of 17th February 2025, at approximately 23:45 hours, a two-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ruotsalanpuro in Kärsämäki, Finland. The incident involved a grey 2018 Volvo V60, registered with the license plate 123-ABC, driven by Mr. Mikko Pietilä, a 45-year-old local resident, and a silver 2020 Toyota Corolla, identified by its license plate number 456-DEF, operated by Ms. Anna Koskinen, a 32-year-old residing in the adjacent municipality of Kauklahti.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **23:40 hours:** Ms. Koskinen was driving westbound on Ruotsalanpuro, approaching the intersection with Kauppakatu. Mr. Pietilä was traveling southbound on Kauppakatu.
- **23:41 hours:** Both drivers were navigating through mixed snow and rain conditions, which reduced visibility and created slippery road surfaces.
- **23:42 hours:** As Ms. Koskinen neared the intersection, she attempted to make a left turn onto Kauppakatu. Mr. Pietilä, maintaining his speed within the 50 km/h limit, collided with the passenger side of Ms. Koskinen's vehicle.
- **23:43 hours:** The impact caused both vehicles to come to an immediate stop in the intersection, alerting passing motorist and witness, Mr. Jussi Lehtinen, who was traveling eastbound on Kauppakatu.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The prevailing weather at the time of the incident was mixed snow and rain, significantly impairing visibility. The road surface was damp with slush, contributing to reduced traction for both vehicles. These conditions were consistent with meteorological data recorded for Kärsämäki on the date in question.

**Vehicle Damage:**

The Volvo V60 sustained substantial damage to its passenger side, including a crumpled door, shattered side window, and misaligned fender. The Toyota Corolla incurred damage to its front passenger quarter panel, hood, and headlight assembly. Both vehicles were towed from the scene by private recovery services for further examination and repairs.

**Witnesses:**

Mr. Jussi Lehtinen, a 30-year-old software engineer residing at 12A Ruotsalanpuro, provided a statement confirming the events as described above. He noted that neither driver appeared to apply brakes prior to the collision, suggesting possible misjudgment of speed or distance due to adverse weather conditions.

**Further Actions:**

Both drivers were transported to the Kärsämäki Central Hospital for medical evaluation and subsequent release with no serious injuries reported. The vehicles have been secured at a local garage pending a thorough investigation by the Finnish Transport Safety Agency (Traficom) to determine causality and potential contributing factors, including driver behavior and road maintenance considerations in mixed weather conditions.
