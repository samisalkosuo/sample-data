**Narrative:**

On the afternoon of 18th May 2024, at approximately 14:35 hours, a three-vehicle traffic incident occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Kirkkokatu in the municipality of Porvoo, Finland. The weather conditions were noted as icy roads, contributing to the challenging driving circumstances.

The vehicles involved in the collision were a silver 2019 Toyota Corolla, registered with the license plate 345-POV, driven by Mr. Mikko Koskinen, a local resident of Kauppakatu 23; a blue 2020 Volvo S60, identified by its license plate number 789-POR, operated by Ms. Anna Pitkänen from nearby Kirkkosträskentie 12; and a red 2018 Ford Focus, bearing the license plate ABC-123, driven by Mr. Jussi Rantala, who resides on Vuorikatu 45.

According to witness statements and CCTV footage from a nearby business, Ms. Pitkänen was proceeding southbound on Kauppakatu towards the intersection intending to turn left onto Kirkkokatu. Mr. Rantala, traveling northbound in his Ford Focus, approached the intersection at a moderate speed. Meanwhile, Mr. Koskinen, in his Toyota Corolla, was following Ms. Pitkänen, maintaining a safe distance.

As Ms. Pitkänen initiated her left turn, she encountered difficulty due to the icy road conditions. Her Volvo S60's tires lost traction, causing the vehicle to drift partially into the northbound lane. Simultaneously, Mr. Rantala, noticing Ms. Pitkänen’s predicament, attempted to brake but was unable to prevent his vehicle from colliding with the Volvo due to the slippery road surface. The impact pushed the Volvo further into the path of the oncoming Toyota Corolla driven by Mr. Koskinen.

The Ford Focus, driven by Mr. Rantala, sustained damage primarily to its front passenger side, including a bent fender and a damaged headlight. The Volvo S60, operated by Ms. Pitkänen, suffered significant damage to its left rear quarter panel and tailgate, with noticeable scrapes and dents. Mr. Koskinen's Toyota Corolla incurred front-end damage, affecting both the hood and the driver’s side headlight area.

Fortunately, all parties involved sustained only minor injuries, primarily from the seatbelt restraints activating during the collision. Emergency medical services arrived promptly at 14:38 hours and transported the individuals to Porvoo Central Hospital for evaluation and treatment. No passengers were reported in any of the vehicles.

**Timeline:**

- 14:20 hours: All vehicles noted traveling within speed limits, adhering to traffic regulations.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The prevailing weather conditions on the day of the incident were partly cloudy with a temperature of -2°C, exacerbating the icy road surfaces. These conditions significantly impaired vehicle traction, contributing to the loss of control experienced by Ms. Pitkänen and subsequent chain-reaction collision.

**Conclusion:**
