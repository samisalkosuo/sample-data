**Incident Description:**

On the night of 01.03.2025, at approximately 23:15 hours, a three-vehicle traffic incident occurred on the main road through Kannus, Finland. The primary location of the collision was at the intersection of Onerkoskukatu and Pohjoiskari street, near address 12345, Kannus.

**Vehicles Involved:**

1. **Driver A**: Mikael Järvinen, age 34, residing at 67890 Luumüki, driving a 2018 Volvo V60 with Finnish license plate 123-AB-45. Mr. Järvinen was traveling southbound on Onerkoskukatu.

2. **Driver B**: Anna-Liisa Koskinen, age 29, residing at 98765 Ivalo, driving a 2015 Toyota Corolla with Finnish license plate 456-CD-78. Ms. Koskinen was proceeding eastbound on Pohjoiskari street intending to turn left onto Onerkoskukatu.

3. **Driver C**: Olli Miettinen, age 42, residing at 32109 Rovaniemi, driving a 2020 Ford Focus with Finnish license plate 789-EF-01. Mr. Miettinen was traveling northbound on Onerkoskukatu.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **23:10 hours**: Ms. Koskinen, in her Toyota Corolla, approached the intersection intending to turn left onto Onerkoskukatu from Pohjoiskari street. Traffic signals indicated a green light for both directions.

- **23:14 hours**: Mr. Järvinen, driving his Volvo V60 southbound on Onerkoskukatu, was traveling at approximately 50 km/h. He was within the speed limit but adjusting his radio, momentarily distracted.

- **23:14:30 hours**: Mr. Miettinen, in his Ford Focus, was approaching the intersection from the north, traveling at 60 km/h. The road conditions were mixed snow and rain, reducing visibility and traction.

- **23:14:45 hours**: Ms. Koskinen initiated her left turn onto Onerkoskukatu directly in front of Mr. Järvinen's path. Due to the slippery road conditions, she underestimated the distance required for a safe turn and collided with Mr. Järvinen’s Volvo.

- **23:14:50 hours**: The impact caused Mr. Järvinen's vehicle to spin, colliding with Mr. Miettinen's Ford Focus as it attempted to brake but lost control on the wet and slushy road surface.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The night was dark with intermittent rainfall mixing with fresh snow on the roads, significantly reducing visibility and creating hazardous driving conditions. The combination of precipitation and temperatures just above freezing resulted in a layer of black ice underneath the wet snow, contributing to the loss of traction experienced by all drivers involved.

**Damage Description:**

- **Volvo V60 (Driver A)**: Significant frontal damage, including a crumpled hood and damaged headlights. Airbags deployed during the collision.

- **Toyota Corolla (Driver B)**: Left side suffered substantial damage, with the front end folded inward and the turn signal indicator broken off.

- **Ford Focus (Driver C)**: Rear-end sustained heavy impact, with the trunk lid caved in and rear lights shattered upon collision.

**Witnesses:**

Two passersby, Sari Pekkarinen and Jussi Hietala, witnessed the incident from a nearby residence on Onerkoskukatu. They reported seeing Ms. Koskinen's vehicle initiate the turn without sufficient clearance and described the road conditions as particularly slippery due to the mixed precipitation.

**Action Taken:**

All drivers were transported to the nearest hospital for evaluation, with no life-threatening injuries reported. The vehicles were towed to a secure location for further investigation and evidence collection. Road conditions were assessed by municipal authorities, who dispatched a gritting crew to address the icy patches on Onerkoskukatu and Pohjoiskari street.
