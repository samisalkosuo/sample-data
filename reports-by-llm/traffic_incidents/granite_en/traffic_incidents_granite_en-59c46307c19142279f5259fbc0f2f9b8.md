On the morning of 28th June 2023, at approximately 09:15 hours, a two-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ruotsalanpuro in Savitaipale, Finland. The incident involved a grey 2018 Volvo V60, registered with the license plate 34-VLL-12, driven by Mr. Mikko Kivinen, a 45-year-old local resident of Ruotsalankuja 12, and a silver 2020 Toyota Corolla, bearing the license plate 23-TJO-98, operated by Ms. Anna Pitkänen, a 32-year-old inhabitant of Kauppakatu 56.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **09:10 hours:** Mr. Kivinen, driving his Volvo V60 eastbound on Kauppakatu towards the intersection with Ruotsalanpuro, came to a stop at the red traffic signal. Ms. Pitkänen, in her Corolla, approached from the south on Ruotsalanpuro, also halting at the stop line for the same red light.

- **09:14 hours:** The traffic lights turned green simultaneously for both directions. Both drivers proceeded cautiously into the intersection.

- **09:15 hours:** As Mr. Kivinen's Volvo entered the intersection, Ms. Pitkänen's Corolla, travelling at approximately 35 km/h, collided with the passenger side of the Volvo. The impact caused significant damage to both vehicles, with the Volvo sustaining a dented passenger door and a cracked headlight, while the Corolla received a bent front fender and a damaged rear quarter panel.

**Witnesses and Additional Information:**

A local resident, Mr. Jari Lehtinen from Ruotsalankuja 15, witnessed the incident and provided a statement confirming that both drivers appeared to have proceeded through the intersection with due care and caution, given the dry but cold weather conditions. There were no reports of injuries, though both drivers sought medical evaluation as a precaution.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The morning was clear with temperatures around 8°C, classified as 'dry but cold' per meteorological standards. The roads were dry, providing good traction, yet the chill may have affected driver alertness and reaction times. There were no contributing weather factors such as ice or fog reported at the scene.

**Damage Descriptions:**

- Volvo V60 (34-VLL-12): Passenger side door dented, headlight cracked. Estimated repair costs: €2,500.

**Conclusion:**

The collision appears to have resulted from a misjudgment of the other vehicle's speed and distance by both drivers in normal traffic conditions.

The vehicles were towed to nearby garages for repair, and the drivers proceeded with insurance claims.
