**Narrative:**

On the evening of 26th October 2023, at approximately 21:45 hours, a multi-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ruotsalanpuro in the municipality of Kiuruvesi, Finland. The incident involved ten vehicles, resulting in various degrees of damage and minor injuries to the occupants.
