**Narrative:**

On the evening of 21st July 2023, at approximately 18:45 hours, a four-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ruotsalanpuro in the municipality of Vehmaa, Finland. The incident involved a minor traffic accident under heavy rainfall, which significantly impacted visibility and road conditions.

The vehicles involved were:
1. A silver 2019 Toyota Corolla, registered KY-1234, driven by Ms. Anna Pitkänen, 34, residing at Kauppakatu 56, Vehmaa.
2. A blue 2020 Ford Focus, registered VH-5678, operated by Mr. Jussi Laine, 41, from Ruotsalanpuro 23, Vehmaa.
3. A red 2018 Volkswagen Golf, identified as FI-9101, driven by Ms. Kaisa Mäkelä, 27, living at Kauppakatu 101, Vehmaa.
4. A grey 2021 Honda Civic, registered LU-3456, operated by Mr. Olli Koskinen, 50, residing at Ruotsalanpuro 99, Vehmaa.

According to witness statements and on-scene evidence, Ms. Pitkänen was proceeding northbound on Kauppakatu approaching the intersection with Ruotsalanpuro. Mr. Laine, traveling eastbound on Ruotsalanpuro, attempted to navigate through the intersection but failed to yield to oncoming traffic due to reduced visibility from heavy rainfall.

Ms. Mäkelä, in her Volkswagen Golf, was proceeding westbound on Ruotsalanpuro and collided with Mr. Laine's Ford Focus as he attempted his left turn. The impact caused Ms. Mäkelä’s vehicle to spin, striking the curb before coming to a stop facing northbound in the southern lane of Kauppakatu.

Simultaneously, Mr. Koskinen, driving the Honda Civic southbound on Kauppakatu, was unable to avoid the collision with Ms. Mäkelä's spinning vehicle due to the heavy rain and slippery road conditions. His Civic struck the passenger side of Ms. Mäkelä’s Golf, pushing it further along Kauppakatu.

**Timeline of Events:**

- 18:40 hours: Heavy rain commences in Vehmaa, significantly reducing visibility and causing wet road surfaces.
- 18:43 hours: Mr. Laine initiates his left turn from Ruotsalanpuro onto Kauppakatu without ensuring the intersection is clear.
- 18:44 hours: Ms. Mäkelä's Volkswagen Golf, traveling westbound on Ruotsalanpuro, collides with Mr. Laine’s Ford Focus at the intersection.
- 18:44-18:45 hours: Ms. Mäkelä’s vehicle spins out of control, striking a curb and coming to rest facing northbound in the southern lane of Kauppakatu.
- 18:45 hours: Mr. Koskinen's Honda Civic, traveling south on Kauppakatu, collides with Ms. Mäkelä’s spinning Golf, pushing it further along the street.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The prevailing weather condition at the time of the incident was heavy rain, which led to poor visibility and slippery road surfaces. The combination of these factors significantly contributed to the drivers' inability to react appropriately to oncoming traffic and maintain control of their vehicles.

**Vehicle Damages:**

1. Ms. Pitkänen's Toyota Corolla: Minor front-end damage from debris impact during the secondary collision.
2. Mr. Laine's Ford Focus: Heavy front-end damage, including a collapsed front passenger side and significant paint transfer.
3. Ms. Mäkelä's Volkswagen Golf: Extensive damage to the passenger side, including a bent frame and damaged wheels.
4. Mr. Koskinen's Honda Civic: Moderate damage to the passenger side, with scrapes and dents along the right-hand panel.

**Witness Statements:**

Several pedestrians near the scene provided consistent accounts of the events leading up to the collision, noting the heavy rainfall and reduced visibility. They also confirmed that Mr. Laine did not activate his turn signal prior to initiating his left turn.

**Conclusion:**

The multi-vehicle collision at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ruotsalanpuro in Vehmaa was primarily caused by driver negligence exacerbated by adverse weather conditions. All drivers involved failed to exercise due care, particularly Mr. Laine, who did not yield right of way, leading to a chain reaction of collisions. No serious injuries were reported, though all parties sustained minor to moderate injuries consistent with the nature of the impacts.

This report is submitted for further investigation and potential disciplinary action as deemed appropriate by the Vehmaa Police Department.
