**Narrative:**

On the evening of 02.09.2024, at approximately 18:15 hours, a two-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Rautatieasema in Karvia, Finland. The drivers involved were identified as Mikko Koskinen, 34, residing at Hietaniemi 23, Karvia, and Laura Pitkäranta, 28, residing at Kauppiakademiat 15, Karvia.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **18:00 - 18:10 hours:** Mikko Koskinen was driving his 2019 Volvo XC60, registered with the license plate 34-VOK-12, southbound on Kauppakatu approaching the Rautatieasema intersection. Laura Pitkäranta was navigating her 2020 Toyota Corolla, bearing the license plate number 28-TOY-98, eastbound on Rautatieasema, preparing to turn left onto Kauppakatu.

- **18:10 - 18:15 hours:** As Mr. Koskinen approached the intersection, the road conditions were slippery due to a recent snowfall. The street lights were on, but visibility was reduced by falling snowflakes. Ms. Pitkäranta initiated her left turn without yielding to oncoming traffic, misjudging the speed and distance of Mr. Koskinen's vehicle.

- **18:15 hours:** The front passenger side of Mr. Koskinen’s Volvo collided with the driver's side of Ms. Pitkäranta’s Corolla. Both vehicles sustained damage; the Volvo exhibited significant front-end structural damage, while the Corolla showed dents and scrapes along its passenger side.

**Witnesses:**

Two pedestrians, Sari Hietala and Olli Mäkelä, walking their dogs on adjacent sidewalks, witnessed the incident and immediately contacted emergency services at 18:16 hours. They reported that Ms. Pitkäranta's turn was initiated abruptly and without proper caution, contributing to the collision.

**Weather Conditions:**

The evening was characterized by intermittent snowfall, reducing visibility and creating slippery road conditions. The temperature was just above freezing at 2°C, with the roads covered in a thin layer of freshly fallen snow, exacerbating the risk of loss of vehicle control.

**Damage Description:**

- Volvo XC60 (License Plate: 34-VOK-12): Extensive damage to the front passenger side, including a crumpled fender, damaged headlight, and scrapes along the bodywork. Airbag deployment was noted, indicating occupant restraint during the impact.

- Toyota Corolla (License Plate: 28-TOY-98): Dents and scratches on the passenger side, with the driver's door misaligned. The front end showed minor abrasions from skidding post-impact.

**Action Taken:**

Both drivers were assessed at the scene by paramedics from the Karvia Health Center and found to have no serious injuries. They were transported to Karvia Hospital for further observation, as per protocol in collision incidents. The vehicles were towed away by a local recovery service, and the intersection was temporarily closed for cleanup and investigation.

**Further Investigation:**

The incident is currently under review for potential traffic violations, specifically focusing on Ms. Pitkäranta's failure to yield right-of-way. Interviews with both drivers and witnesses will be conducted, and any available CCTV footage from nearby establishments will be examined to corroborate accounts and determine liability.
