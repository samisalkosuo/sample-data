**Narrative:**

On the morning of 04.08.2023, at approximately 08:15, a two-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ratinauksenmäki in the municipality of Polvijärvi, Finland. The incident involved a white 2019 Toyota Corolla, registered with the license plate 345-FIN-A, driven by Mr. Mikko Koskinen, 38, of Kauppakatu 12, Polvijärvi, and a grey 2020 Ford Focus, registered with the license plate 789-FIN-B, operated by Ms. Sanna Hietala, 27, of Ratinauksenmäki 5, Polvijärvi.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **08:10:** Ms. Hietala, driving her Ford Focus eastbound on Ratinauksenmäki towards the intersection with Kauppakatu, encountered reduced visibility due to dense fog rolling in from the nearby lake.

- **08:12:** Mr. Koskinen, proceeding northbound on Kauppakatu, approached the intersection. The fog impeded his vision, and he failed to notice the slowing Ford Focus ahead.

- **08:14:** Ms. Hietala, having slowed down due to the fog, came to a near stop at the stop sign at the intersection. Mr. Koskinen, unaware of her presence due to the heavy fog, continued northbound and collided with the rear passenger side of Ms. Hietala's vehicle.

- **08:15:** The impact caused both vehicles to spin, with the Corolla coming to rest facing westbound on Ratinauksenmäki and the Focus facing northeast, partially blocking the intersection.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The prevailing weather condition at the time of the incident was foggy, significantly reducing visibility to approximately 50 meters. The road surface was dry but slick from dew, contributing to the vehicles' reduced traction upon impact.

**Vehicle Damage:**

- The Toyota Corolla sustained damage primarily to its rear passenger side, including a dented door, broken taillight, and scrapes along the side panel.

- The Ford Focus incurred damage to its front passenger side, with a crumpled fender, a bent headlight, and scratches on the hood.

**Witnesses:**

A local resident, Mr. Jouko Rantala, who lives at Kauppakatu 20, witnessed the incident from his balcony and immediately called emergency services. He reported that both drivers appeared shaken but uninjured.

**Action Taken:**

Upon arrival, officers secured the scene, ensured no further hazards existed, and facilitated the exchange of information between the involved parties. Both vehicles were towed from the scene for inspection and repair. No immediate medical attention was required, but both drivers were advised to seek a medical check-up as a precaution due to the nature of the collision.
