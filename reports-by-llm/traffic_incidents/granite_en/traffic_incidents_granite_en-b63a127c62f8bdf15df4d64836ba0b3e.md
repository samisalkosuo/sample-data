**Narrative:**

On the evening of 30 August 2024, at approximately 18:15 hours, a three-vehicle traffic incident occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ruotsalanpuro in the municipality of Tervo, Finland. The weather conditions were described as a thunderstorm with heavy rainfall and reduced visibility.

The vehicles involved were operated by the following individuals:
- **Driver A:** Mikko Kivinen, 34, residing at Kauppakatu 23, Tervo. He was driving a blue 2019 Volvo V60 with Finnish license plate 123-ABC.
- **Driver B:** Anna Pitkänen, 28, living at Ruotsalanpuro 45, Tervo. She was behind the wheel of a red 2020 Toyota Corolla, bearing the license plate 456-DEF.
- **Driver C:** Olli Mäkelä, 52, from Kauppakatu 19, Tervo. He operated a grey 2017 Ford Focus, identified by the license plate 789-GHI.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **18:10 hours:** Drivers A and B approached the intersection from perpendicular directions. The traffic lights were functioning correctly but visibility was significantly impaired due to the ongoing thunderstorm.
- **18:12 hours:** As Driver A entered the intersection intending to turn left onto Ruotsalanpuro, Driver B, proceeding straight on Kauppakatu, collided with the passenger side of Driver A's vehicle. The impact caused both vehicles to spin, with the Volvo coming to rest facing the opposite direction on Kauppakatu.
- **18:13 hours:** Meanwhile, Driver C, traveling southbound on Ruotsalanpuro, was unable to stop in time and struck the rear of Driver A's Volvo as it was spinning out of control. This secondary collision caused substantial damage to both the Volvo and the Ford Focus.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The thunderstorm with heavy rainfall and strong winds significantly reduced visibility, contributing to the drivers' inability to react promptly to changing traffic conditions. The wet road surface also increased stopping distances and made maneuvering more challenging.

**Vehicle Damage Descriptions:**

- **Volvo V60 (Driver A):** Sustained damage to the passenger side, including a dented door, shattered side window, and front-end collision marks. Airbag deployment was noted.
- **Toyota Corolla (Driver B):** Frontal damage to the driver's side, with a crumpled hood and fender, alongside a broken headlight.
- **Ford Focus (Driver C):** Rear-end damage, including a smashed trunk lid and taillights, as well as frontal scuff marks from impacting the Volvo.

**Witness Statements:**

Several pedestrians in the vicinity provided statements corroborating the sequence of events. Notably, witness Marko Rantanen, 42, reported seeing both initial collisions and the subsequent impact involving Driver C's vehicle.

**Conclusion:**

The traffic incident was primarily caused by adverse weather conditions leading to reduced visibility and increased reaction times for all drivers involved. All parties were transported to Tervo Central Hospital for medical evaluation, with no life-threatening injuries reported. The investigation is ongoing to determine liability fully, considering the complex nature of the multi-vehicle collision under challenging weather conditions.
