**Narrative:**

On the evening of 20 April 2023, at approximately 21:45 hours, a multi-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ratinauksenmäki in the municipality of Pälkäne, Finland. The incident involved eleven vehicles, resulting in various degrees of damage and minor injuries to the drivers and passengers.

The primary cause of the collision appears to be adverse weather conditions combined with high traffic volume. Heavy rainfall reduced visibility, making it challenging for drivers to perceive and react to traffic signals and other vehicles in a timely manner. The road surface was wet and slippery, contributing to decreased traction and increased stopping distances.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **21:38 hours:** Heavy rain commences in Pälkäne, affecting visibility and road conditions.
- **21:40 hours:** Vehicle 1 (a white 2022 Toyota Corolla, license plate 123-ABC registered to Jari Koskinen of Kauppakatu 56) approaches the intersection from the north on Kauppakatu, failing to notice the red traffic signal due to poor visibility.
- **21:41 hours:** Vehicle 2 (a blue 2021 Ford Focus, license plate 456-DEF registered to Laura Pitkänen of Ratinauksenmäki 34) enters the intersection from the east on Ratinauksenmäki, proceeding through a green light. The collision occurs as Vehicle 1 attempts to navigate through the intersection.
- **21:41 - 21:46 hours:** A chain reaction ensues involving ten additional vehicles, including a red 2020 Volkswagen Golf (license plate 789-GHI registered to Marko Räisänen), a green 2019 Honda Civic (license plate JKL-MNO registered to Sanna Kivinen), and a black 2023 Tesla Model 3 (license plate PQR-STU registered to Olli Mäkelä).

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The weather during the incident was characterized by persistent heavy rainfall, significantly impairing visibility. The road surface was wet, leading to reduced tire grip and extended braking distances for the involved vehicles. These conditions exacerbated the complexity of navigating the intersection safely.

**Witnesses and Further Investigation:**

Several witnesses were present at the scene, including pedestrians and occupants of nearby businesses on Kauppakatu and Ratinauksenmäki. Statements have been collected, and CCTV footage from local establishments is being reviewed to supplement the investigation.

**Conclusion:**

The collision was primarily caused by hazardous weather conditions coupled with driver inattention leading to failure to adhere to traffic signals. All drivers involved are cooperating with the ongoing investigation, and no criminal charges have been filed at this time. Traffic safety reminders emphasizing vigilance during inclement weather will be disseminated within the Pälkäne community.
