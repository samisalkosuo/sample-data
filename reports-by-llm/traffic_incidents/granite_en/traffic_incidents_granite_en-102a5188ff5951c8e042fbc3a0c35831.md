**Reporting Officer:** Inspector Jouko Hietala

**Narrative of Events:**

On 07 May 2024, at approximately 14:30, the Kumlinge Police Department responded to a multi-vehicle collision on Kauppakatu, a primary thoroughfare in the heart of Kumlinge. The incident involved three vehicles: a silver 2019 Toyota Corolla, registered as FIN-123XY, driven by Mr. Mikko Koskinen, 45, of Kauppakatu 56; a blue 2020 Ford Focus, identified as FIN-456ZX, operated by Ms. Sanna Pitkänen, 31, from the nearby address of Kauppakatu 122; and a white 2018 Volvo V60, marked with the license plate FIN-789LM, driven by Mr. Jussi Rantala, 52, residing at Kauppakatu 34.

**Witness Statements:**

A passerby, Ms. Aino Mäkelä, a local teacher, provided an account of the events. She stated that she observed the Ford Focus approaching from the south on Kauppakatu at what seemed an excessive speed for the icy conditions. The Toyota Corolla was proceeding northward, maintaining a steady pace in the correct lane. Suddenly, Ms. Pitkänen's vehicle appeared to lose control on the slippery road surface, veering into the opposing lane and colliding with the Corolla. The impact propelled both vehicles into a spin, with the Corolla coming to rest against a decorative tree island near the intersection of Kauppakatu and Pohjoiskatu.

Ms. Mäkelä continued her statement by describing how Mr. Rantala's Volvo, traveling north behind the Corolla, was unable to avoid the collision in progress. He attempted to brake but skidded on the icy pavement, striking the rear of the Toyota with considerable force before coming to a halt near Kauppakatu’s northern curb.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **14:28:** Ms. Pitkänen's Ford Focus was observed by Ms. Mäkelä traveling at an unusually high speed southbound on Kauppakatu, despite icy road conditions.
  
- **14:29:** The Corolla, driven by Mr. Koskinen, maintained a lawful northward trajectory on Kauppakatu.

- **14:30:** Ms. Pitkänen's vehicle began to skid due to icy roads, crossing into the opposing lane and colliding with the Corolla.

- **14:30 - 14:31:** Both vehicles spun out of control, with the Corolla striking a tree island and the Focus continuing its path, partially into the northbound lane.

- **14:31:** Mr. Rantala's Volvo, following closely behind the Corolla, attempted to brake but slid on the icy surface, impacting the rear of the Corolla before coming to a stop near Pohjoiskatu’s curb.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The prevailing weather conditions at the time of the incident were partly cloudy with intermittent light snowfall, resulting in icy road surfaces. These conditions significantly contributed to the loss of vehicle control experienced by Ms. Pitkänen and the subsequent chain-reaction collision.

**Vehicle Damage:**

- **Toyota Corolla (FIN-123XY):** Significant frontal damage, including a crumpled hood and damaged headlights. The passenger side sustained minor scuffing from contact with the tree island.

- **Ford Focus (FIN-456ZX):** Heavy damage to the front passenger side, with the driver's side door misaligned. Airbag deployment was noted.

- **Volvo V60 (FIN-789LM):** Rear-end damage, affecting the trunk and taillights. No airbag deployment was reported as seatbelts were engaged.

**Injuries:**

All involved parties sustained minor injuries, primarily from the impact of airbags in Ms. Pitkänen's vehicle. Emergency medical services transported them to Kuopio Central Hospital for evaluation and treatment. Mr. Koskinen and Mr. Rantala declined ambulance transport despite police recommendation, citing they felt well enough to seek medical attention later.

**Investigation Status:**

The scene was secured, and evidence collected, including photographs of vehicle positions, skid marks, and road conditions. Witness statements were recorded, and the involved parties' details verified. The investigation is ongoing as we await toxicology reports for Ms. Pitkänen to determine if speed or impairment played a role in the incident.
