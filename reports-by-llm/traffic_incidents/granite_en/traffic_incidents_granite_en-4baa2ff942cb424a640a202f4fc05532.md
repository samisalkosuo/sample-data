*Incident Number:* 2024-FIN-FS-001  
*Date of Incident:* 26th December, 2024  
*Location:* Intersection of Kauppakatu and Rautatieasema, Finström, Finland  
*Reporting Officer:* Inspector Jouko Hietala, Finnish Police Department  

**Narrative:**

On the evening of 26th December, 2024, at approximately 17:30 hours, a two-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Rautatieasema in Finström, Finland. The incident involved a white 2019 Volvo XC60, registered with the license plate 123-ABC, driven by Mr. Mikko Kivinen, a 45-year-old local resident of Kauppakatu 12, and a silver 2020 Toyota Corolla, bearing the license plate 456-DEF, operated by Ms. Anna Pitkänen, a 32-year-old resident of Rautatieasema 56.

**Timeline of Events:**

1. **17:20 hours:** Mr. Kivinen was driving westbound on Kauppakatu towards the intersection with Rautatieasema, proceeding at a moderate speed, in accordance with the posted limit of 50 km/h. Ms. Pitkänen was traveling southbound on Rautatieasema approaching the same intersection, adhering to the speed limit of 40 km/h.

2. **17:28 hours:** As Mr. Kivinen neared the intersection, icy road conditions, exacerbated by recent snowfall, caused his vehicle to lose traction. He applied the brakes but was unable to prevent sliding into the intersection.

3. **17:29 hours:** Ms. Pitkänen, noticing Mr. Kivinen's vehicle skidding, also attempted to apply her brakes. However, due to the icy roads, she too lost control of her vehicle, which drifted across the intersection, colliding with Mr. Kivinen’s Volvo.

4. **17:30 hours:** The collision occurred in the southwest quadrant of the intersection, resulting in significant damage to both vehicles. Mr. Kivinen's Volvo sustained substantial front-end damage, including a crumpled hood and damaged headlights. Ms. Pitkänen’s Corolla suffered considerable side impact damage, with the passenger door being heavly dented and the rear wheel misaligned.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The prevailing weather conditions at the time of the incident were clear but icy. A light snowfall had occurred earlier in the day, leaving a thin layer of ice on the road surface. This contributed to reduced traction for both drivers, impairing their ability to control their vehicles effectively.

**Damage Description:**

- **Volvo XC60 (123-ABC):** Frontal damage included a crumpled hood, smashed headlights, and scrapes along the passenger side. Airbag deployment was noted, indicating occupant restraint during the collision.

- **Toyota Corolla (456-DEF):** The passenger side exhibited heavy denting, particularly around the door and quarter panel. The rear wheel appeared misaligned, suggesting potential axle damage. No airbag deployment was reported by Ms. Pitkänen or her passenger, a 3-year-old child secured in a booster seat.

**Witnesses:**

Two pedestrians, Mr. Jari Lehtinen and Ms. Laura Mäkelä, witnessed the incident from a nearby café on Kauppakatu. They reported that both drivers attempted to brake but were unsuccessful in avoiding the collision due to the icy conditions.

**Further Actions:**

Both vehicles were towed from the scene by Finnish Road Administration services. The drivers, Mr. Kivinen and Ms. Pitkänen, were transported to the local hospital for routine checks following the accident. No serious injuries were reported. The investigation is ongoing to determine liability, with a focus on assessing each driver's adherence to safe driving practices under challenging weather conditions.
