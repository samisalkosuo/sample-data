**Narrative:**

On the afternoon of 01.12.2022, at approximately 14:35 hours, a two-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ruohoniekusiedunkatu in Kerava, Finland. The drivers involved were Mr. Mikko Pietilä, 38, residing at Kauppakatu 23, and Ms. Anna-Liisa Hiltunen, 45, from Ruohoniekusieduntie 19.

Mr. Pietilä was driving a silver 2018 Volvo V60, bearing the Finnish license plate 87-VHK-12, traveling southbound on Kauppakatu approaching the intersection. Ms. Hiltunen was operating a blue 2015 Toyota Corolla, licensed under the plate 34-TJO-12, proceeding westbound on Ruohoniekusiedunkatu towards the same intersection.

As per witness statements from passersby, Ms. Hiltunen proceeded through the intersection without fully stopping at the stop sign, colliding with Mr. Pietilä's Volvo as he navigated his vehicle through the crossroads. The impact caused significant damage to both vehicles; the front passenger side of the Volvo sustained substantial structural and cosmetic damage, while the Corolla's front end was crumpled, particularly the driver’s side.

*Timeline of Events:*

*Weather and Road Conditions:*

The overcast weather, with low cloud cover, contributed to reduced visibility during daylight hours. Although no precipitation was reported, the diffuse lighting conditions may have impaired drivers' ability to perceive each other's movements clearly. The roads were dry but showed signs of wear from recent inclement weather, potentially affecting traction.
