*Incident Number:* 230724-FIN-KET-01  
*Date of Incident:* 24th July 2023  
*Location:* Intersection of Kauppakatu and Ruotsalanpuro, Keitele, Finland

**Narrative:**

On the evening of 24th July 2023, at approximately 18:15 hours, a multi-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ruotsalanpuro in the municipality of Keitele, Finland. The incident involved ten vehicles, resulting in various degrees of damage and minor injuries to the occupants.

The primary cause of the accident appears to be a combination of heavy thunderstorm conditions and driver error. Visibility was significantly reduced due to intense rainfall and lightning strikes in the area. At the time, several motorists were navigating through Keitele en route to their evening destinations.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **18:05 hours:** A thunderstorm began over Keitele, reducing visibility on major roads like Kauppakatu.
- **18:10 hours:** Vehicle 1 (a blue 2020 Toyota Corolla, license plate 3456-FIN) approached the intersection from the north on Kauppakatu, driven by Mr. Mikko Koskinen, 32, of Ruotsalanpuro 12.
- **18:12 hours:** Vehicle 2 (a red 2018 Ford Focus, license plate 7890-FIN), driven by Ms. Sanna Pitkänen, 25, of Kauppakatu 45, entered the intersection from the east, failing to yield to oncoming traffic due to the obscured visibility caused by the storm.
- **18:13 hours:** Vehicle 3 (a green 2016 Honda Civic, license plate 1234-FIN), driven by Mr. Jari Mäkelä, 47, of Kauppakatu 78, attempted to navigate a stop sign on Ruotsalanpuro but was blinded by the lightning, colliding with Vehicle 2.
- **18:14 hours:** The impact from Vehicle 3's collision caused Vehicle 2 to spin out, striking Vehicles 4 through 10 in a chain reaction fashion. These vehicles included a white 2021 Volkswagen Golf (license plate 5678-FIN), a silver 2019 Audi A3 (license plate 9101-FIN), a black 2017 Nissan Qashqai (license plate 2345-FIN), a grey 2015 BMW 3 Series (license plate 6789-FIN), a yellow 2019 Citroën C3 (license plate 1111-FIN), and three motorcycles (a KTM 390 Duke, a Honda CB400X, and a Yamaha MT-03).

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The thunderstorm, characterized by heavy rainfall and frequent lightning strikes, severely impaired visibility. The wet road surface compounded the hazard, leading to reduced traction and increased stopping distances for the involved vehicles.

**Vehicle Damage Descriptions:**

- Vehicle 1 (Toyota Corolla): Front-end damage from impact with Vehicle 2.
- Vehicle 2 (Ford Focus): Significant side damage from collisions with Vehicles 3 and subsequent vehicles.
- Vehicle 3 (Honda Civic): Stopped at the stop sign, struck in the rear by Vehicle 2.
- Vehicle 4 (Volkswagen Golf): Rear-end collision with Vehicle 2.
- Vehicle 5 (Audi A3): Side impact from Vehicle 2 during its spin.
- Vehicle 6 (Nissan Qashqai): Frontal damage from being struck by Vehicle 2.
- Vehicle 7 (BMW 3 Series): Rear-end collision with Vehicle 2.
- Vehicles 8 to 10 (Citroën C3, KTM 390 Duke, Honda CB400X, Yamaha MT-03): Various impacts and collisions as they were caught in the chain reaction.

**Injuries:**

A total of six individuals sustained minor injuries during the incident. All were treated at the scene by emergency medical services and subsequently transported to Pirkanmaa Hospital for further evaluation. No life-threatening conditions were reported.

**Witnesses:**

Several witnesses provided statements, including Ms. Anna Rautiainen (22) of Kauppakatu 34 and Mr. Olli Virtanen (50) of Ruotsalanpuro 18, who observed the events leading up to the collision from nearby premises.

**Conclusion:**

The multi-vehicle accident at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ruotsalanpuro in Keitele was primarily caused by adverse weather conditions exacerbated by driver error. All parties involved are cooperating with the investigation, and further analysis will determine liability and potential charges.
