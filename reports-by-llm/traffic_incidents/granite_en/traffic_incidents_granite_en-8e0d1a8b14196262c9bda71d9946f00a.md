**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The thunderstorm, characterized by heavy rainfall and reduced visibility, significantly contributed to the severity of the incident. Wet road surfaces exacerbated braking distances, leading to an increased likelihood of collisions. The sudden downpour likely caught some drivers off guard, affecting their reaction times and decision-making processes at the critical intersection.

**Witness Statements:**

Several pedestrians witnessed the incident from a nearby café on Kauppakatu. They reported that all involved vehicles were traveling at what appeared to be reasonable speeds prior to the collisions, with no overtly reckless driving behavior observed. The sudden nature of the thunderstorm and its impact on visibility seemed to play a crucial role in the unfolding events.
