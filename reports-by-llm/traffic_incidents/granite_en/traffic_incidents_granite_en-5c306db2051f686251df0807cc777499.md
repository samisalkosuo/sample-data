**Narrative:**

On the afternoon of 20 September 2023, at approximately 14:15 hours, a three-vehicle traffic incident occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ristimäenkangas in Suonenjoki, Finland. The vehicles involved were operated by the following individuals:

1. **Driver A**: Mikael Kuusisto, 34 years old, residing at Valtionpuistari 23, Suonenjoki. He was driving a silver 2019 Toyota Corolla with Finnish license plate 87-ABC.
2. **Driver B**: Anna Pitkänen, 28 years old, residing at Kauppiakademi 15, Suonenjoki. She was driving a blue 2020 Ford Focus with Finnish license plate 34-DEF.
3. **Driver C**: Olli Miettinen, 56 years old, residing at Linnunlaulujärvenkatu 12, Suonenjoki. He was driving a white 2017 Volvo V60 with Finnish license plate 98-GHI.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **14:10 hours**: Light rain began falling in Suonenjoki, reducing visibility and creating slippery road conditions on Kauppakatu and Ristimäenkangas.
- **14:12 hours**: Driver A, proceeding westbound on Kauppakatu towards the intersection, failed to fully stop at the stop sign due to the wet road surface.
- **14:13 hours**: Driver B, traveling southbound on Ristimäenkangas, approached the intersection cautiously but was unable to avoid colliding with Driver A's vehicle as it entered the intersection. The impact pushed Driver A's Corolla into the side of Driver C's Volvo, which was waiting at a red light on Kauppakatu.
- **14:15 hours**: All drivers brought their vehicles to a stop. No immediate injuries were reported by the involved parties.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The prevailing weather condition during the incident was light rain, which contributed to reduced visibility and slippery road surfaces. The combination of these factors likely played a significant role in the failure of Driver A to come to a complete stop, leading to the subsequent chain-reaction collision.

**Vehicle Damage:**

1. **Toyota Corolla (Driver A)**: Sustained damage primarily to the passenger side, including a dented door and scratches along the paneling. The front bumper was also slightly misaligned.
2. **Ford Focus (Driver B)**: Experienced minor cosmetic damage to the front bumper and hood due to the impact while attempting to avoid the primary collision.
3. **Volvo V60 (Driver C)**: Suffered more substantial damage, with significant scrapes along the driver's side and a deployed airbag indication, suggesting potential internal damage.

**Witness Statements:**

A passerby, Marko Lehtinen, 42, of Suonenjoki, witnessed the incident from a nearby café and confirmed that all drivers appeared shaken but uninjured immediately post-collision. He also noted that none of the vehicles appeared to have skid marks prior to the impact, suggesting that the rain conditions may have affected braking efficacy.

**Action Taken:**

All parties were transported to the Suonenjoki Health Center for routine medical checks, with negative findings regarding injuries. The vehicles were subsequently towed to a secure yard for further inspection and evidence collection. The intersection was temporarily closed for a detailed investigation and subsequent cleanup of debris and fluids spilled during the incident.
