**Narrative:**

On the night of 04.06.2023, at approximately 23:15, a two-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ratinauksenmäki in Taivalkoski, Finland. The incident involved a grey 2018 Volvo V60, registered with the license plate 34-VLO-FI, driven by Mr. Mikko Koskinen, 35, of Kauppakatu 12, Taivalkoski, and a silver 2020 Toyota Corolla, registered with the license plate 23-TOY-FI, operated by Ms. Anna Pitkänen, 27, of Ratinauksenmäki 5, Taivalkoski.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **23:10**: Ms. Pitkänen was driving westbound on Ratinauksenmäki approaching the intersection with Kauppakatu. Mr. Koskinen was traveling southbound on Kauppakatu, preparing to turn left onto Ratinauksenmäki.
- **23:14**: As Ms. Pitkänen neared the intersection, she reportedly reduced her speed due to heavy rainfall and poor visibility caused by a thunderstorm. A witness, Mr. Jussi Lehtinen, who was driving eastbound on Kauppakatu, noted that Ms. Pitkänen activated her left turn signal.
- **23:15**: Mr. Koskinen, having waited for an appropriate gap in traffic, initiated his left turn onto Ratinauksenmäki directly in front of Ms. Pitkänen's vehicle. Despite her signaling intent to turn left, the collision occurred when the front passenger side of Ms. Pitkänen’s Corolla struck the driver's side of Mr. Koskinen's Volvo.
- **23:16**: Both vehicles came to a stop on the northeast quadrant of the intersection. Immediately, Mr. Lehtinen pulled over and approached to render assistance, confirming that neither driver appeared to be seriously injured.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The incident took place during a thunderstorm, with heavy rain reducing visibility significantly. The road surface was wet, increasing the risk of hydroplaning and prolonging braking distances. Lightning flashes illuminated the scene intermittently, further complicating drivers' ability to assess traffic conditions accurately.

**Vehicle Damage:**

The Volvo V60 sustained damage primarily to its driver's side door and front passenger fender, with visible scrapes and dents. The Toyota Corolla incurred damage to its front passenger side, including a bent hood latch and scratches along the passenger door.

**Witnesses:**

Mr. Jussi Lehtinen, an IT specialist residing at Kauppakatu 20, Taivalkoski, provided a statement confirming Ms. Pitkänen's signal use and her reduced speed prior to the collision. No other witnesses were present at the scene, though Mr. Lehtinen’s account was corroborated by CCTV footage from a nearby business.

**Action Taken:**

Emergency services were dispatched, and both drivers were transported to the Taivalkoski Central Hospital for precautionary checks. No serious injuries were reported. The vehicles were towed to a secure location for further investigation and repair. The intersection was temporarily closed for a detailed examination of the scene and subsequent cleanup due to the storm's aftermath.
