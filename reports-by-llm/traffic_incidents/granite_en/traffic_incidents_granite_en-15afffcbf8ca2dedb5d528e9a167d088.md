**Narrative:**

On the evening of 06.03.2025, at approximately 21:45 hours, a multi-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Rautatieasema in the municipality of Inkoo, Finland. The incident involved eleven vehicles, resulting in various degrees of damage and minor injuries to the drivers and passengers.

The primary cause of the accident appears to be a combination of mixed snow and rain conditions on the roadway, which significantly reduced visibility and traction for the drivers. At the time, the weather was described as intermittent light snow showers mixing with heavy rain, creating hazardous driving conditions.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **21:30 hours:** Heavy rain and occasional snow began falling in Inkoo, leading to slippery road surfaces.
- **21:35 hours:** A Ford Focus driven by Mr. Mikko Koskinen, license plate 87-FIN-12, was traveling eastbound on Kauppakatu approaching the intersection with Rautatieasema.
- **21:38 hours:** Ms. Anna Pitkänen in a Volvo V60, license plate 54-FIN-98, proceeded through a green light at Rautatieasema heading southbound, unaware that Koskinen's vehicle was losing control due to the adverse weather conditions.
- **21:39 hours:** Koskinen's Ford Focus skidded on the wet snow-covered road and collided with Pitkänen’s Volvo at the intersection, pushing it into the path of oncoming traffic.
- **21:40-21:42 hours:** A chain reaction ensued as subsequent vehicles, including a Toyota Corolla (driven by Mr. Jari Lehtinen, license plate 32-FIN-67), a Honda Civic (Ms. Laura Mäkelä, license plate 15-FIN-43), and others, were unable to stop in time and collided with the initial crash site or each other.

1. Ford Focus (Finnish License Plate: 87-FIN-12) - Driver: Mikko Koskinen
   - Front-end damage, airbags deployed.

2. Volvo V60 (Finnish License Plate: 54-FIN-98) - Driver: Anna Pitkänen

**Witnesses:**

Several pedestrians and occupants of nearby businesses provided statements corroborating the sequence of events. Notably, Ms. Sari Kivinen, a resident at 12 Kauppakatu, witnessed the initial collision and alerted emergency services promptly.

**Road Conditions:**

The intersection of Kauppakatu and Rautatieasema was poorly lit, exacerbating visibility issues during the stormy night. Road markings were partially obscured by accumulating water and slush, contributing to driver confusion and reduced reaction times.

**Conclusion:**

The collision was a result of adverse weather conditions coupled with driver error. All parties involved are cooperating with the investigation, and charges are being considered for those found negligent under Finnish traffic laws. The Inkoo Police Department is working in collaboration with local emergency services to ensure thorough documentation and analysis of the incident for future preventive measures.
