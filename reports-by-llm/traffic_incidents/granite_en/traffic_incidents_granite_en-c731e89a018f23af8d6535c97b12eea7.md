**Narrative:**

On the evening of 31st March 2025, at approximately 18:30, a three-vehicle traffic incident occurred at the intersection of Etelä-Kaupunkinrinne and Kauniainen's central roundabout. The drivers involved were identified as Mr. Jari Pitkäranta, Ms. Anna Miettinen, and Mr. Olli Virtanen.

Mr. Pitkäranten, driving a 2018 Volvo S60 with Finnish license plate 123-ABC, was proceeding eastbound on Etelä-Kaupunkinrinne towards the roundabout. Ms. Miettinen, operating a 2020 Toyota Corolla bearing the license plate 456-DEF, approached from the southern entrance to the roundabout intending to merge onto Etelä-Kaupunkinrinne. Mr. Virtanen, in control of a 2017 Ford Focus with license plate 789-GHI, was traveling westbound on Etelä-Kaupunkinrinne, heading away from the roundabout.

As all vehicles entered the roundabout, heavy rain associated with an ongoing thunderstorm significantly reduced visibility. Witnesses reported that Mr. Pitkäranten's vehicle hydroplaned slightly as he navigated the wet roundabout pavement, causing him to lose control momentarily. This loss of control led to his vehicle drifting into Ms. Miettinen’s path.

Ms. Miettinen, upon noticing Mr. Pitkäranten's erratic movement, attempted to brake but was unable to avoid a collision due to the slippery conditions. The Toyota Corolla struck the rear passenger side of the Volvo S60, pushing it further into the roundabout. Simultaneously, Mr. Virtanen, having observed the developing situation, attempted to maneuver his Ford Focus to avoid both vehicles but was unable to prevent a subsequent impact with the rear of Ms. Miettinen's Corolla as she was pushed into his lane.

**Timeline of Events:**

- 18:25 - Thunderstorm intensifies in Kauniainen, leading to heavy rainfall and reduced visibility.
- 18:28 - All three vehicles enter the roundabout intersection.
- 18:30 - Mr. Pitkäranten's Volvo S60 hydroplanes on the wet pavement within the roundabout.
- 18:31 - Ms. Miettinen’s Toyota Corolla collides with the rear passenger side of Mr. Pitkäranten's vehicle as it loses control.
- 18:32 - Mr. Virtanen's Ford Focus strikes the rear of Ms. Miettinen's Corolla, now partially in his lane due to the initial collision.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The thunderstorm with heavy rainfall significantly impaired visibility and created hazardous road conditions. The combination of wet pavement and reduced light due to the storm contributed to the hydroplaning incident involving Mr. Pitkäranten's vehicle, directly influencing the sequence of collisions.

**Vehicle Damage:**

- Volvo S60 (123-ABC): Rear passenger side suffered substantial damage, with a dented door and broken taillight.
- Toyota Corolla (456-DEF): Front driver's side sustained impact marks, the front bumper was pushed inward, and there was minor damage to the hood.
- Ford Focus (789-GHI): Rear passenger side exhibited scratches and a dent, with the rear bumper slightly misaligned.
