**Timeline of Events:**

- At approximately 18:40 hours, windy conditions with gusts began affecting the area, reducing visibility and making road surfaces slippery.

- At 18:43 hours, Mr. Räty initiated his left turn from Ruotsalanpuro onto Kauppakatu without yielding to oncoming traffic due to a momentary lapse in attention caused by the gusty winds.

- Ms. Pitkäranta, driving the Toyota Corolla, was unable to stop in time and collided with Mr. Räty's Volvo at the side where the driver’s door met the passenger side of the car.

- The impact caused a chain reaction, involving subsequent collisions as vehicles behind attempted to avoid the initial crash. Ms. Koskinen's Ford Focus struck Mr. Räty's vehicle, followed by Mr. Mäkelä's Honda Civic colliding with Ms. Koskinen’s car.

- Meanwhile, Mr. Niemi's BMW attempted to overtake Ms. Lehtinen's Nissan Qashqai on the inside lane but lost control due to the slippery road conditions, crashing into the rear of Ms. Lehtinen's vehicle.

- Following this, Mr. Kivinen's Audi, driven too closely behind Ms. Lehtinen, collided with the back of the Nissan Qashqai.

- Ms. Hiltunen's Mazda3, approaching cautiously, managed to brake in time but was struck from behind by Mr. Kiviniemi's Subaru as he turned right onto Ruotsalanpuro.

- Finally, Mr. Virtanen's Dodge Charger, overtaking slower vehicles ahead, swerved to avoid the escalating situation but clipped the front of Ms. Hiltunen’s Mazda3 before coming to a stop.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The prevailing weather conditions on the evening in question were windy with gusts, significantly impacting visibility and road traction. The combination of reduced sightlines due to wind-blown debris and slippery roads contributed to the severity of the collisions.

**Witness Statements:**

Several witnesses were present at nearby bus stops and residences, providing consistent accounts of the events leading up to the collision. Notable observations included Mr. Räty's failure to yield and the sudden gust of wind that seemed to startle him just before his turn.

**Conclusion:**

The multi-vehicle collision at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ruotsalanpuro in Laitila was primarily caused by Mr. Mikko Räty's failure to yield while making a left turn, exacerbated by adverse weather conditions including strong gusts that impaired visibility and road traction. All parties involved sustained minor to moderate injuries, and vehicles incurred varying degrees of damage. The incident serves as a reminder of the heightened risks associated with challenging weather during peak traffic hours.
