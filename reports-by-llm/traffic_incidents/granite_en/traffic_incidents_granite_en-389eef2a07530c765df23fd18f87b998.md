**Narrative:**

On the morning of 28th January 2025, at approximately 09:15 hours, a two-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Rannikko in the municipality of Paimio, Finland. The incident involved a white 2018 Volvo V60, registered with the license plate 34-VLO-PA, driven by Mr. Mikko Kivinen, a local resident of Kauppakatu, and a silver 2020 Toyota Corolla, identified by its license plate 12-TOY-PA, operated by Ms. Anna Rautiainen, who resides on Rannikko.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **09:08 hours:** Ms. Rautiainen, proceeding eastbound on Rannikko towards the intersection with Kauppakatu, encountered reduced visibility due to dense fog rolling in from the nearby lake. She maintained a cautious speed, adhering to the posted 50 km/h limit.

- **09:12 hours:** Mr. Kivinen, traveling southbound on Kauppakatu, approached the intersection at the same time. The fog conditions significantly impaired visibility, obscuring his view of Ms. Rautiainen's vehicle as she neared the crossroads.

- **09:14 hours:** As both drivers entered the intersection, Ms. Rautiainen attempted a left turn onto Kauppakatu. Mr. Kivinen, unable to observe her intentions due to the fog, collided with the passenger side of Ms. Rautiainen's Corolla.

- **09:15 hours:** The collision caused both vehicles to come to an immediate stop in the intersection, drawing the attention of several passing pedestrians and a nearby delivery truck driver, Mr. Jussi Pitkäranta, who witnessed the incident from a safe distance.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The prevailing weather conditions at the time were foggy, with visibility reduced to approximately 100 meters. The road surface was dry but slick due to overnight dew, contributing to the vehicles' reduced traction upon impact. Emergency services arrived promptly, noting that while there were no immediate life-threatening injuries, both drivers exhibited signs of shock and were transported to Paimio Central Hospital for precautionary medical assessments.

**Vehicle Damage:**

The Volvo V60 sustained significant damage to its passenger side, including a crumpled front fender, a dented door, and broken side-mirror glass. The Toyota Corolla bore scratches along the driver's side and passenger door, with the left turn signal lens shattered.

**Witness Statements:**

Mr. Pitkäranta corroborated the sequence of events, stating that both drivers appeared to be proceeding cautiously but were unable to avoid the collision due to the severe fog. No other vehicles or pedestrians were involved in the incident.

**Conclusion:**

This report details a two-vehicle collision resulting from adverse weather conditions—dense fog—which impaired visibility and contributed to the drivers' inability to perceive each other's intentions at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Rannikko, Paimio. Both parties were cooperative during the investigation, and no citations were issued at this time pending further review of available CCTV footage from nearby businesses. The case remains open for potential adjustments should additional evidence come to light.
