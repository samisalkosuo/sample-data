**Traffic Incident Report**

*Incident Number:* 231030-FIN-PUN-01  
*Date of Incident:* 30 October 2023  
*Location:* Intersection of Kauppakatu and Ratinkatu, Punkalaidun, Finland  
*Reporting Officer:* Inspector Jouko Hietanen  

**Narrative:**

On the evening of 30 October 2023, at approximately 21:45 hours, a two-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ratinkatu in Punkalaidun. The incident involved a grey 2018 Volvo V60, registered with the license plate 923-FIN-A, driven by Mr. Mikko Kivinen, a 45-year-old local resident, and a silver 2020 Toyota Corolla, identified by its license plate 124-FIN-B, operated by Ms. Anna Pitkänen, a 31-year-old teacher residing in nearby Kuopio.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **21:40 hours:** Mr. Kivinen was driving westbound on Kauppakatu towards the intersection with Ratinkatu. Ms. Pitkänen was traveling southbound on Ratinkatu, approaching the same intersection.
- **21:43 hours:** As Mr. Kivinen neared the stop line at Ratinkatu, he checked his rearview mirror and initiated a left turn intending to proceed onto Ratinkatu. Ms. Pitkänen, maintaining a moderate speed, was approximately 80 meters from the intersection.
- **21:44 hours:** Wind gusts, reaching speeds of up to 50 km/h, caused Mr. Kivinen's Volvo to sway slightly as he turned left, reducing his visibility for oncoming traffic. Simultaneously, Ms. Pitkänen encountered a sudden gust that momentarily distracted her attention from the road ahead.
- **21:45 hours:** The Volvo, partially obscured by the gusts, collided with the passenger side of the Corolla as Ms. Pitkänen attempted to brake but was unable to avoid the impact due to the reduced reaction time exacerbated by the wind conditions.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The night was clear but featured intermittent, strong gusts of wind, reducing visibility and potentially affecting vehicle handling. The road surface, although dry, had accumulated fine debris from the wind, contributing to reduced traction. These conditions likely played a role in the drivers' diminished ability to react promptly to each other's movements.

**Vehicle Damage:**

The Volvo sustained significant damage to its passenger side, including a dented door, shattered side window, and misaligned fender. The Corolla incurred damage to its front passenger quarter panel, with scratches and a bent headlight assembly. Both vehicles were towed from the scene for further examination and repair.

**Witnesses:**

Two pedestrians, Mr. Jari Lehtinen and Ms. Laura Mäkelä, who were walking their dogs on adjacent sidewalks, provided statements corroborating the described sequence of events. They noted the wind's intensity and its potential impact on both drivers' attentiveness just prior to the collision.

**Conclusion:**

The incident appears to have resulted from a combination of driver error compounded by adverse weather conditions. Both parties were cited for failing to yield right-of-way and for driving without due care and attention, given the challenging windy conditions. No serious injuries were reported, with both drivers and passengers sustaining minor cuts and bruises.
