**Narrative:**

On the evening of 21st September 2024, at approximately 18:30 hours, a multi-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Metsäntie in Ylitornio, Finland. The incident involved five vehicles, resulting in minor injuries to the drivers and passengers involved.

The primary vehicles involved were:
1. A white 2020 Toyota Corolla, registered KY-1234, driven by Mr. Mikko Koskinen, a local teacher residing at 45 Kauppakatu, Ylitornio.
2. A grey 2018 Volvo V60, registered YL-5678, operated by Ms. Anna Pitkänen, a nurse from 12 Metsäntie, Ylitornio.
3. A blue 2019 Ford Focus, identified as LT-9101, driven by Mr. Jussi Rantala, a carpenter living at 78 Kauppakatu, Ylitornio.
4. A red 2016 Honda Civic, marked SV-3456, operated by Ms. Sanna Lehtinen, a student at the Ylitornio University of Applied Sciences, residing at 31 Metsäntie, Ylitornio.
5. A black 2017 Nissan Qashqai, noted as QN-2345, driven by Mr. Teppo Miettinen, a construction worker from 56 Kauppakatu, Ylitornio.

**Timeline of Events:**

- At approximately 18:20 hours, Ms. Anna Pitkänen, driving the Volvo V60, approached the intersection from the north on Metsäntie intending to turn left onto Kauppakatu.
- Mr. Mikko Koskinen in the Corolla was proceeding south on Kauppakatu towards the same intersection.
- Simultaneously, Mr. Jussi Rantala in the Focus was traveling south on Kauppakatu, following the Corolla closely.
- Ms. Sanna Lehtinen in the Civic was heading north on Metsäntie, approaching the intersection intending to turn right onto Kauppakatu.
- Mr. Teppo Miettinen in the Qashqai was driving north on Metsäntie, behind the Civic, also intending to turn right onto Kauppakatu.

As Ms. Pitkänen initiated her left turn, she lost control of the Volvo due to icy road conditions. The vehicle slid across the intersection, colliding with Mr. Rantala's Focus on the passenger side. The impact caused the Focus to spin, striking Ms. Lehtinen's Civic on its driver’s side. Meanwhile, Mr. Miettinen, unable to stop in time, collided with the rear of the Civic, pushing it further into the intersection.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The roads were reported icy due to overnight freezing temperatures following light snowfall earlier in the day. The Finnish Meteorological Institute recorded a temperature low of -1°C during the early morning hours, leading to the formation of ice on road surfaces, contributing significantly to the loss of vehicle control experienced by the drivers involved.

**Vehicle Damage:**

- The Volvo V60 sustained damage primarily to its left front and passenger side, including a bent front bumper and dented door.
- The Focus suffered damage to its right side, with a crumpled passenger door and scrapes along the rear quarter panel.
- The Civic incurred damage to its driver's side, evidenced by a dented door and scratches along the front fender.
- The Qashqai showed signs of impact on its rear bumper, indicating the collision with the Civic during the chain reaction.

**Injuries:**

All drivers and passengers involved reported minor injuries consistent with seatbelt usage and airbag deployment. Emergency medical services transported them to Ylitornio Central Hospital for evaluation and treatment.

**Investigation Status:**

The scene was secured, and all vehicles were towed to a secure yard for further examination. Witness statements were collected from passersby, including Ms. Liisa Koskinen, who witnessed the incident while walking her dog near the intersection. The investigation is ongoing, with a focus on determining liability and assessing potential contributing factors such as speed and adherence to traffic signals under icy conditions.
