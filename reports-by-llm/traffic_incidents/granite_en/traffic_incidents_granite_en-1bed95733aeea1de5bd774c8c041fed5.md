**Traffic Incident Report**

*Incident Number:* 234567  
*Date of Incident:* 28 August 2023  
*Location:* Intersection of Oulunmäki and Kauppiamajanpuro, Ylivieska, Finland  
*Reporting Officer:* Inspector Jouko Hietala  
*Municipality:* Ylivieska  

**Narrative:**

On the evening of 28 August 2023, at approximately 17:45 hours, a three-vehicle traffic incident occurred at the intersection of Oulunmäki and Kauppiamajanpuro in Ylivieska. The weather conditions were heavy rain, which significantly impacted visibility and road grip.

The vehicles involved were a grey 2019 Toyota Corolla, registered as YL-1234, driven by Mr. Mikko Koskinen, 35, of Oulunmäki 12A; a blue 2020 Ford Focus, identified as VY-5678, operated by Ms. Anna Pietilä, 29, residing at Kauppiamajanpuro 3B; and a white 2018 Volvo S60, marked with license plate number VL-9101, driven by Mr. Jussi Rantala, 42, from Hietaniemi 5C.

According to witness statements and CCTV footage from a nearby business, Mr. Koskinen was proceeding northbound on Oulunmäki approaching the intersection with Kauppiamajanpuro. Ms. Pietilä, traveling eastbound on Kauppiamajanpuro, attempted to turn left across Mr. Koskinen's path. Simultaneously, Mr. Rantala was southbound on Oulunmäki, heading towards the same intersection.

The heavy rain and slippery road conditions are believed to have contributed to Ms. Pietilä misjudging the speed and proximity of oncoming traffic. Upon realizing her error, she attempted to halt but was unable to prevent her vehicle from colliding first with Mr. Koskinen's Toyota Corolla. The impact propelled Mr. Koskinen’s vehicle sideways, where it then collided with the rear of Mr. Rantala's Volvo S60, which was unable to stop in time due to the wet road surface.

**Timeline of Events:**

- 17:40 hours: Heavy rain commences in Ylivieska.
- 17:42 hours: Ms. Pietilä initiates her left turn from Kauppiamajanpuro onto Oulunmäki.
- 17:43 hours: Mr. Koskinen's Toyota Corolla enters the intersection, unaware of Ms. Pietilä’s intent to turn.
- 17:44 hours: Initial collision between Ms. Pietilä's Ford Focus and Mr. Koskinen's Toyota Corolla.
- 17:44 hours (approximately 1 second later): Mr. Rantala’s Volvo S60 collides with the rear of Mr. Koskinen's vehicle, which was pushed into the intersection following the first impact.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The roads were wet due to ongoing heavy rainfall, reducing visibility and traction. The Finnish Meteorological Institute recorded 35 mm of precipitation in Ylivieska between 17:00 and 18:00 on the date in question, contributing to hazardous driving conditions.

**Vehicle Damage:**

- Mr. Koskinen's Toyota Corolla sustained damage to the front passenger side, a bent front bumper, and minor structural deformation to the driver’s side door.
- Ms. Pietilä's Ford Focus incurred significant damage to the front left quarter panel, a crumpled hood, and a disabled left turn signal.
- Mr. Rantala's Volvo S60 suffered rear-end damage, including a dented trunk lid and minor alignment issues.

**Witnesses:**

Two pedestrians, Ms. Liisa Koskinen (no relation to the driver) and Mr. Petteri Pietilä, provided statements corroborating the sequence of events and described the weather conditions as extremely challenging for driving.

**Action Taken:**

All parties involved were transported to Ylivieska Central Hospital for assessment, with no life-threatening injuries reported. The vehicles were towed to a secure location for further examination and evidence collection. Traffic diversions were implemented on Oulunmäki and Kauppiamajanpuro while the scene was processed.

This report is submitted for further investigation and potential insurance claims processing. Further inquiries should be directed to Inspector Jouko Hietala at the Ylivieska Police Department.
