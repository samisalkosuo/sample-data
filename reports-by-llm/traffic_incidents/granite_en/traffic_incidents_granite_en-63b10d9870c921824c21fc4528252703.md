**Narrative:**

On the morning of 18th January 2025, at approximately 09:15 hours, a four-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ruotsalanpuro in Eurajoki, Finland. The incident involved a minor traffic pile-up under mixed snow and rain conditions.

The vehicles involved were driven by the following individuals:
1. Mr. Mikko Koskinen, 34, residing at Kauppakatu 23, Eurajoki. Driving a silver 2018 Volvo V60 with Finnish license plate 123-ABC.
2. Ms. Anna Pitkänen, 29, living at Ruotsalanpuro 45, Eurajoki. Operating a blue 2017 Toyota Corolla bearing the license plate 456-DEF.
3. Mr. Jussi Lehtinen, 42, from Kauppakatu 19, Eurajoki. Driving a red 2015 Ford Focus with license plate GHI-789.
4. Ms. Sanna Virtanen, 31, residing at Ruotsalanpuro 11, Eurajoki. In control of a white 2016 Honda Civic marked with license plate JKL-012.

**Timeline of Events:**

- At approximately 09:08 hours, Mr. Koskinen was traveling southbound on Kauppakatu approaching the Ruotsalanpuro intersection. He reported reduced visibility due to mixed snow and rain.
  
- Ms. Pitkänen, proceeding eastward on Ruotsalanpuro intending to turn left onto Kauppakatu, encountered Mr. Lehtinen's vehicle. Mr. Lehtinen was traveling northbound on Kauppakatu, approaching the same intersection.

- Ms. Virtanen was following behind Mr. Lehtinen in the same northbound lane on Kauppakatu, maintaining a safe distance.

- Upon approaching the stop line at Ruotsalanpuro, Ms. Pitkänen initiated her left turn without yielding to oncoming traffic, colliding with Mr. Koskinen's Volvo. The impact caused Mr. Koskinen’s vehicle to spin, subsequently striking Mr. Lehtinen's Ford Focus. Ms. Virtanen, unable to stop in time, collided with the rear of Mr. Lehtinen's car.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The prevailing weather at the time was mixed snow and rain, reducing visibility and creating slippery road conditions. The intersection, lacking advanced traffic signals, relied on standard stop signs, which were obscured by accumulating snow.

**Vehicle Damages:**

1. Mr. Koskinen's Volvo V60 sustained damage to the front passenger side, with significant front-end misalignment and a flattened right front tire.
   
2. Ms. Pitkänen's Toyota Corolla suffered damage to the left front, including a dented fender and a cracked headlight.

3. Mr. Lehtinen's Ford Focus incurred damage to the rear driver’s side, with a bent rear bumper and a scraped trunk lid.

4. Ms. Virtanen's Honda Civic showed minor rear-end damage, primarily affecting the boot lid and license plate area.

**Witness Statements:**

Several passersby provided statements corroborating the sequence of events. A local resident, Mr. Petteri Mäkelä, witnessed Ms. Pitkänen's failure to yield and reported seeing her vehicle collide with Mr. Koskinen before his car spun into Mr. Lehtinen’s path.

**Conclusion:**

The collision was primarily caused by Ms. Pitkänen's negligence in failing to yield the right of way while making a left turn, exacerbated by adverse weather conditions. All drivers were cited for minor traffic violations related to their roles in the incident. No serious injuries were reported, though all parties involved sought medical evaluation as a precaution.
