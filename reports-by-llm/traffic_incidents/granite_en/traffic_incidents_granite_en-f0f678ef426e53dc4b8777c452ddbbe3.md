On the evening of 05.05.23, at approximately 18:15 hours, a four-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppiaselkä and Yliannalinna Streets in Seinäjoki, Finland.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **18:05 hours:** Ms. Rantala, driving the Volvo S60, approached the intersection from the north on Yliannalinna Street, intending to turn left onto Kauppiaselkä Street. Mr. Koskinen in the Ford Focus was traveling south on Kauppiaselkä Street towards the same intersection.
- **18:07 hours:** Mr. Pekkarinen in the Toyota Corolla was heading east on Yliannalinna Street, approaching the intersection with intent to turn right onto Kauppiaselkä Street. Ms. Virtanen in the Nissan Sentra was traveling west on Yliannalinna Street, proceeding straight through the intersection.
- **18:09 hours:** As Ms. Rantala initiated her left turn, she collided with Mr. Koskinen's Ford Focus, which had proceeded through the intersection against a red light.

- **18:10 hours:** Simultaneously, Mr. Pekkarinen's Corolla, turning right, was struck by Ms. Virtanen's Sentra, which had failed to yield the right of way.
