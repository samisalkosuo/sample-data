*Reporting Officer:* Inspector Jouko Hietala

**Narrative:**

On the evening of 20 April 2024, at approximately 18:30 hours, a two-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppiaselkä and Metsänkangas in Kaskinen. The incident involved a white 2019 Toyota Corolla, driven by Mr. Jari Pitkäranta, 45, residing at Kauppiaselkä 123, and a silver 2020 Ford Focus, operated by Ms. Anna-Liisa Kivinen, 32, from Metsänkangas 456.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **18:25 hours:** Ms. Kivinen departed her residence in Metsänkangas intending to travel north on Kauppiaselkä towards the town center. Mr. Pitkäranta was already en route southbound on Kauppiaselkä, heading from his workplace towards home.
- **18:28 hours:** As Ms. Kivinen approached the intersection, visibility was significantly reduced due to dense fog rolling in from the nearby lake. She maintained a cautious speed but struggled to discern Mr. Pitkäranta's vehicle as it neared the crossroads.
- **18:30 hours:** The collision occurred when Ms. Kivinen, unable to fully assess the oncoming traffic due to fog, proceeded through the intersection. Her Ford Focus was struck on its passenger side by Mr. Pitkäranta's Toyota Corolla, which had failed to halt at the stop sign.
- **18:32 hours:** Both drivers brought their vehicles to a stop. No immediate injuries were reported, though both occupants expressed shock and sought reassurance from each other. Witnesses, including Ms. Leena Rantala who was walking her dog nearby, confirmed that the stop sign for southbound traffic on Kauppiaselkä was visible but obscured by fog.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The prevailing weather condition at the time of the incident was foggy, with reduced visibility to approximately 50 meters. The road surface was damp due to intermittent light rain, compounding the hazardous conditions for drivers.

**Vehicle Information and Damage:**

- **Toyota Corolla (Driver: Jari Pitkäranten):** License plate 123-JK-45; sustained damage primarily to the front passenger side, including a crumpled fender and minor paint transfer from Ms. Kivinen's vehicle.
- **Ford Focus (Driver: Anna-Liisa Kivinen):** License plate 678-KL-90; suffered significant damage to the passenger door and side panel, with scrapes extending along the vehicle’s length from the impact point.

**Witness Statements:**

Ms. Leena Rantala corroborated the accounts of both drivers, noting that while she attempted to alert Ms. Kivinen of the approaching vehicle by shouting, her voice was quickly drowned out by the fog's muffling effect.

**Conclusion:**

The collision resulted from a combination of factors including reduced visibility due to fog and potentially insufficient reaction time for Ms. Kivinen to avoid the intersection. Mr. Pitkäranten is being cited for failing to obey the stop sign. Both parties agreed to handle any further claims through their respective insurance providers, acknowledging no severe injuries were sustained.
