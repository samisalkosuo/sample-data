**Narrative:**

On the afternoon of 04.11.23, at approximately 14:35 hours, a two-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Onerva Street and Kalevantori Avenue in Forssa, Finland. The drivers involved were identified as Mikko Pietilä, 38, residing at Hietalaenkatu 12, Forssa, and Anna Rautiainen, 29, living at Kauppakatu 45, Forssa.

Pietilä was driving a 2018 Volvo V60 with Finnish license plate 123-ABC, traveling southbound on Onerva Street. Rautiainen was operating a 2020 Toyota Corolla, registered under the license plate number 456-DEF, proceeding westbound on Kalevantori Avenue.

As per witness statements from passersby, including Jari Koskinen and Markku Lehtinen, both residing in Forssa, Pietilä proceeded through the intersection without fully stopping at the stop sign, colliding with Rautiainen's vehicle as she navigated her right turn onto Onerva Street. The impact caused significant damage to both vehicles. Pietilä's Volvo sustained considerable front-end damage, including a crumpled hood and damaged headlights, while Rautiainen's Corolla suffered substantial side panel damage, a bent passenger-side door, and a flat tire.
