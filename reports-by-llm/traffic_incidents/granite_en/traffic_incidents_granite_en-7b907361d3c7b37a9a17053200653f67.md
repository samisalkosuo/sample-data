**Traffic Incident Report**

*Incident Number:* 230328-FIN-HAN-01  
*Date of Incident:* 28 March 2023  
*Location:* Intersection of Kauppakatu and Metsäntie, Hankasalmi, Finland  
*Reporting Officer:* Inspector Jouko Rantala, Hankasalmi Police Department  

**Narrative:**

On the morning of 28 March 2023, at approximately 09:15 hours, a two-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Metsäntie in Hankasalmi, Finland. The incident involved a grey 2018 Volvo V60, registered with the license plate 34-VHL-12, driven by Mr. Mikko Hietala, a 39-year-old local resident of Kauppakatu 56, and a blue 2020 Ford Focus, registered with the license plate 23-FOF-98, operated by Ms. Anna Pitkänen, a 27-year-old resident of Metsäntie 112.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **09:10 hours:** Ms. Pitkänen, driving her Ford Focus eastbound on Metsäntie, approached the intersection intending to turn left onto Kauppakatu. Mr. Hietala, in his Volvo, was travelling southbound on Kauppakatu towards the same intersection.
- **09:14 hours:** As Ms. Pitkänen entered the intersection, she reportedly failed to yield to oncoming traffic, colliding with Mr. Hietala's vehicle. The impact occurred on the passenger side of both vehicles.
- **09:15 hours:** The collision was witnessed by Mr. Jari Koskinen, a 42-year-old construction worker, who was waiting at a nearby bus stop on Kauppakatu. He immediately called emergency services.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

At the time of the incident, a thunderstorm was actively affecting the region. Rain was falling heavily, reducing visibility and creating slippery road conditions. The storm had begun around 08:45 hours, intensifying by 09:00 hours, which likely contributed to the reduced traction and increased reaction times for both drivers.

**Vehicle Damage:**

- **Volvo V60 (34-VHL-12):** The passenger side of the vehicle sustained significant damage, including a crumpled door, shattered window, and misaligned fender. Airbag deployment was noted, indicating occupant presence. Mr. Hietala reported minor injuries and was transported to the Hankasalmi Central Hospital for treatment.
- **Ford Focus (23-FOF-98):** The driver's side of the vehicle also showed substantial damage—a bent front bumper, dented hood, and a broken headlight. Ms. Pitkänen was assessed on-site by emergency medical services and deemed to have sustained minor injuries; she was subsequently transported to the same hospital for further evaluation.

**Witnesses:**

In addition to Mr. Koskinen, another witness, Ms. Laura Mäkelä, a 35-year-old teacher, provided her account from a nearby café. She confirmed seeing Ms. Pitkänen enter the intersection without yielding and described the heavy rainfall as a contributing factor to the accident.

**Conclusion:**

The collision appears to have resulted primarily from a failure to yield at an intersection during adverse weather conditions. Both drivers were cited for traffic violations related to their actions leading up to the crash. Further investigation, including potential weather impact assessments and vehicle black box data retrieval, is ongoing to fully understand contributing factors.
