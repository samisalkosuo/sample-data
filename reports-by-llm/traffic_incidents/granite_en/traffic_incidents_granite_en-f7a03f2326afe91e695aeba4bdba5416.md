**Narrative:**

On the morning of 05.06.2025, at approximately 08:45, a two-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppiaselkä and Yli-Kemienkatu in Kemi, Finland. The incident involved a white 2019 Toyota Corolla, registered with the license plate 34-KYM-12, driven by Mr. Mikko Hietala, 38, of Yli-Kemienkatu 15, and a grey 2020 Ford Focus, registered with the license plate 12-KEM-98, operated by Ms. Anna Pitkänen, 27, of Kauppiaselkä 33.

**Timeline:**

- **08:40**: Mr. Hietala, traveling eastbound on Yli-Kemienkatu towards the intersection, encountered reduced visibility due to a light snowfall. The recent accumulation of snow on the road surface made driving conditions hazardous.
  
- **08:42**: Ms. Pitkänen, proceeding northbound on Kauppiaselkä approaching Yli-Kemienkatu, was similarly affected by the snowy conditions. She reported reduced traction and difficulty in maintaining her vehicle's trajectory.

- **08:43**: Both vehicles entered the intersection simultaneously. Mr. Hietala proceeded through a green light, while Ms. Pitkänen, misjudging her speed relative to oncoming traffic, turned left across Mr. Hietala’s path.

- **08:44**: The front passenger side of Ms. Pitkänen's Ford Focus collided with the driver's side front of Mr. Hietala's Toyota Corolla. Both vehicles sustained damage, primarily to their front ends, with significant scraping and denting evident on both vehicles.

**Witnesses:**

Two pedestrians, Ms. Liisa Rantanen and Mr. Jussi Kivinen, who were walking their dogs in the vicinity, witnessed the incident and immediately contacted emergency services at 08:45. They reported that both drivers exited their vehicles unharmed and appeared shaken but otherwise physically intact.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The morning was characterized by intermittent snowfall, reducing visibility and creating slippery road conditions. The recent snow had not been cleared from the intersection, contributing to the hazardous driving environment.

**Vehicle Damage:**

- **Toyota Corolla (34-KYM-12):** Front passenger side fender crumpled, headlight shattered, and paint scraped along the driver's side door.

- **Ford Focus (12-KEM-98):** Driver's side front panel dented, hood sustained a scratch, and the turn signal lens broken off.

**Action Taken:**

Emergency services arrived at 08:47 and confirmed that neither driver required medical attention. The vehicles were towed from the scene for repairs. Both drivers were issued warnings for failing to adjust their driving to the adverse weather conditions, as per Finnish Road Traffic Act §26(3).
