*Incident Number:* 2024-Vöyri-0919  
*Date of Incident:* 19 September 2024  
*Location:* Intersection of Kauppakatu and Ruotsalanpuro, Vöyri, Finland

**Narrative:**

On the morning of 19 September 2024, at approximately 08:30, a three-vehicle traffic incident occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ruotsalanpuro in the municipality of Vöyri, Finland. The vehicles involved were operated by the following individuals:

1. **Driver A:** Mikael Kivinen, 42, residing at Kauppakatu 56, Vöyri. He was driving a silver 2020 Toyota Corolla with Finnish license plate 87-TJO-12.
2. **Driver B:** Anna Pitkänen, 34, residing at Ruotsalanpuro 19, Vöyri. She was operating a blue 2018 Volvo S60 with Finnish license plate 56-VAN-98.
3. **Driver C:** Olli Mäkelä, 57, residing at Kauppakatu 32, Vöyri. He was in control of a red 2015 Ford Focus with Finnish license plate 23-FOR-76.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **08:25:** Light rain began falling in Vöyri, reducing visibility and creating slippery road conditions on Kauppakatu and Ruotsalanpuro.
- **08:28:** Driver A, Mikael Kivinen, approached the intersection from the west on Kauppakatu, intending to turn left onto Ruotsalanpuro.
- **08:29:** Driver B, Anna Pitkänen, was traveling eastward on Ruotsalanpuro, proceeding towards her destination.
- **08:30:** Driver C, Olli Mäkelä, was heading south on Kauppakatu, approaching the intersection intending to turn right onto Ruotsalanpuro.

As all three drivers neared the intersection, the slippery road conditions, combined with the reduced visibility due to light rain, led to a misjudgment of distances and speeds. Driver A attempted his left turn but failed to yield to oncoming traffic. Simultaneously, Driver C, intending to turn right, collided with Driver B's Volvo as she proceeded through the intersection. The impact caused Driver B’s vehicle to spin, coming to a stop partially blocking Ruotsalanpuro.

Driver A's Toyota Corolla sustained damage to the front passenger side, while Driver C's Ford Focus received significant damage to the driver's side and front end. Anna Pitkänen reported minor injuries and was transported to the Vaasa Central Hospital for evaluation. There were no other reported passengers in any of the vehicles involved.

**Witness Statements:**

- **Witness 1:** Elina Rantanen, a local resident at Kauppakatu 45, provided a statement confirming the light rain and slippery conditions preceding the incident. She also noted that all vehicles were traveling at what seemed like reasonable speeds for the weather but mentioned Driver A did not fully stop before initiating his turn.
- **Witness 2:** Marko Salminen, who was driving past the intersection in the opposite direction on Kauppakatu, stopped to assist. He confirmed the sequence of events and corroborated the wet road conditions.

**Damage Descriptions:**

1. **Toyota Corolla (Driver A):** Front passenger side door dented, minor scratches along the side panel, and front bumper showing signs of impact.
2. **Volvo S60 (Driver B):** Driver's side door severely damaged, rear wheel misaligned, and significant paint transfer noted on the vehicle’s rear quarter panel.
3. **Ford Focus (Driver C):** Driver's side front fender crumpled, hood dented, and front bumper detached from the vehicle body.

**Conclusion:**

The incident appears to have been caused by a combination of factors including adverse weather conditions, potentially affecting driver perception and reaction times, and a failure to yield at an intersection. All drivers involved cooperated with the investigation, and no criminal negligence was evident. The case will be referred for insurance claims processing, considering the described damages and minor injuries sustained by Driver B.
