**Narrative:**

On the evening of 25.03.2023, at approximately 21:45 hours, a two-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Rannikko in Maarianhamina, Finland. The incident involved a grey 2018 Volvo V60, registered with the license plate 92-ABC1, driven by Mr. Petteri Koskinen, 34, of Kauppakatu 56, and a silver 2015 Toyota Corolla, registered with the license plate 34-DEF2, operated by Ms. Anna Pietiläinen, 29, of Rannikko 12.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **21:40 hours:** Ms. Pietiläinen was driving westbound on Rannikko approaching the intersection with Kauppakatu. Mr. Koskinen was traveling southbound on Kauppakatu, preparing to turn left onto Rannikko.
- **21:42 hours:** As Ms. Pietiläinen entered the intersection, she reportedly failed to yield to oncoming traffic, colliding with Mr. Koskinen's Volvo. The impact occurred on the passenger side of both vehicles.
- **21:43 hours:** A witness, Mr. Jari Lehtinen, who was driving eastbound on Kauppakatu and stopped to assist, reported that Ms. Pietiläinen appeared distracted by her mobile phone moments before the collision.

**Weather Conditions:**

The incident took place during a thunderstorm, with heavy rainfall reducing visibility. Lightning flashes illuminated the scene intermittently, and strong winds compounded the hazardous conditions. The road surface was slick from accumulated water, contributing to the severity of the collision.

**Vehicle Damage:**

- The Volvo V60 sustained significant damage to its passenger side, including a crumpled front fender and door, along with airbag deployment. Mr. Koskinen reported minor injuries and was transported to Maarianhamiä Central Hospital for evaluation.
- The Toyota Corolla also suffered considerable damage on the passenger side, with a bent passenger door, broken side mirror, and airbag deployment. Ms. Pietiläinen reported no injuries but was noted to be visibly shaken.

**Witness Statements:**

- Mr. Jari Lehtinen confirmed seeing Ms. Pietiläinen using her phone just prior to the collision and provided a description of her vehicle's trajectory into the intersection.
- A passerby, Ms. Kaisa Rantala, who was walking her dog nearby, corroborated the heavy rainfall and strong winds, stating that visibility was severely compromised.

**Conclusion:**

The collision appears to have resulted from a failure to yield by Ms. Pietiläinen, exacerbated by distracted driving under adverse weather conditions. Both drivers were cooperative during the investigation, and no further parties are involved. The scene was cleared and normal traffic resumed by 22:30 hours. An official warning has been issued to Ms. Pietiläinen for careless driving under Finnish Road Traffic Act, Section 68. Further investigation into potential mobile phone usage during driving is ongoing.
