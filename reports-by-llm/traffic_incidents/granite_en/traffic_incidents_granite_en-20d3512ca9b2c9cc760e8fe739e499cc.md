**Narrative:**

On the evening of 06 February 2025, at approximately 17:45 hours, a multi-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ruotsalanpuro in the municipality of Asikkala, Finland. The incident involved five vehicles, resulting in minor injuries to the drivers and passengers involved.

The primary vehicles involved were:
1. A silver 2020 Toyota Corolla, registered KY-1234, driven by Mr. Mikko Koskinen, a local resident of Kauppakatu 23.
2. A blue 2018 Volvo V60, registered JO-5678, operated by Ms. Sanna Pitkänen, traveling from the south on Ruotsalanpuro.
3. A red 2019 Ford Focus, identified as LI-9101, driven by Mr. Jussi Lehtinen, a resident of nearby Linnunlaulu 15.
4. A white 2022 Hyundai i30, bearing the plates HO-2345, under the control of Ms. Anna Mäkelä, originating from Kauppakatu 47.
5. A grey 2016 Nissan Qashqai, registered UA-6789, driven by Mr. Olli Virtanen, coming from the east along Kauppakatu.

According to witness statements and CCTV footage from a nearby business, Mr. Koskinen was proceeding westward on Kauppakatu approaching the intersection with Ruotsalanpuro. Ms. Pitkänen, in her Volvo, was lawfully navigating Ruotsalanpuro with a green light. However, she failed to notice the approaching Corolla due to the clear, sunny weather causing glare.

As Mr. Koskinen's vehicle entered the intersection, it was struck on its passenger side by Ms. Pitkänen’s Volvo. The impact caused the Corolla to spin, colliding with the Ford Focus driven by Mr. Lehtinen, who was proceeding through the intersection on a green light from Linnunlaulu.

Simultaneously, the Hyundai i30, driven by Ms. Mäkelä, was traveling east on Kauppakatu and, upon seeing the initial collision, attempted to brake but skidded on the dry asphalt, striking the rear of Mr. Lehtinen's Ford Focus. The Nissan Qashqai, driven by Mr. Virtanen, was approaching from the east and, unable to halt in time, collided with the side of Ms. Mäkelä’s Hyundai as it was pushed forward by the impact.

All drivers and passengers sustained minor injuries, primarily from whiplash and seatbelt restraint. Emergency services, including Asikkala Ambulance Service and Fire Department, arrived promptly at 17:50 hours to provide medical attention and secure the scene. Traffic was diverted for approximately two hours while the investigation and clearance operations were conducted.
