**Timeline:**

- **08:40**: Mr. Koskinen, driving his Volvo V60 southbound on Metsäntie, approached the intersection with Kauppakatu. Ms. Pitkänen in her Toyota Corolla was waiting to turn left onto Metsäntie from Kauppakatu.
- **08:42**: Mr. Lehtinen in his Ford Focus, traveling northbound on Kauppakatu, failed to stop at the red light due to snow-covered roads reducing traction. He collided with Ms. Pitkänen's Corolla, pushing it into the intersection.
- **08:43**: Mr. Mäkelä in his Nissan Qashqai, traveling eastbound on Kauppakatu, attempted to avoid the collision but skidded on the snowy road and struck the rear of Mr. Lehtinen's Focus.
- **08:44**: Ms. Virtanen in her Honda Civic, heading westbound on Metsäntie, was unable to stop due to the slippery conditions and collided with Mr. Koskinen's Volvo, pushing it further into the intersection.
- **08:45**: Ms. Räty in her Opel Astra, traveling eastbound on Kauppakatu, also lost control on the snowy surface and collided with the rear of Ms. Virtanen's Honda Civic.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

At the time of the incident, light snowfall was reported in Rantasalmi, with roads covered in a thin layer of snow. The reduced visibility and poor traction due to the snow contributed to the drivers' inability to maintain control of their vehicles, leading to the chain reaction collision.

**Damage Descriptions:**

- Toyota Corolla: Rear driver's side damage (crumpled fender, scrapes).
- Ford Focus: Front driver's side and right side damage (bent hood, dented door).

- Nissan Qashqai: Rear passenger side damage (broken tail light, scrapes).

**Injuries:**

All drivers and passengers sustained minor injuries, primarily from whiplash due to the sudden stops. They were transported to Rantasalmi Central Hospital for evaluation and treatment. No life-threatening conditions were reported.

**Investigation Status:**

The scene was secured, and all vehicles involved were towed to a secure yard for further examination. Witness statements have been collected from passengers in nearby buildings, confirming the sequence of events. The investigation is ongoing to determine liability and potential charges related to the failure to stop at red lights under snowy conditions.
