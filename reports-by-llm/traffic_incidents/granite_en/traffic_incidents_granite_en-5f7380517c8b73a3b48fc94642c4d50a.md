**Traffic Incident Report**

*Incident Number:* 2024-KAN-001  
*Date of Incident:* 03.02.2024  
*Location:* Intersection of Kauppakatu and Ruotsalanpuro, Kankaanpää, Finland  
*Reporting Officer:* Jari Pitkäjärvi, Badge #1234  

**Narrative:**

On the evening of 03.02.2024, at approximately 21:15 hours, a two-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ruotsalanpuro in Kankaanpää, Finland. The drivers involved were identified as Mikko Hietala, 34, residing at Kauppiaseppä 12, and Jari Penttinen, 47, residing at Ruotsalanpuro 3.

Hietala was driving a 2018 Volvo V60, licensed plate 123-IV, traveling southbound on Kauppakatu, while Penttinen operated a 2020 Toyota Corolla, bearing the license plate 456-JP, proceeding westbound on Ruotsalanpuro. The collision took place when Penttinen, according to witness statements and preliminary evidence, failed to yield the right of way at the stop sign, resulting in a broadside impact with Hietala's vehicle.

Witnesses, including passersby Anna Kaski and local shop owner Marko Rantanen, provided accounts corroborating the sequence of events. They reported that Penttinen's vehicle, a Toyota Corolla, was moving at a moderate speed without apparent braking prior to impact, whereas Hietala's Volvo was traveling within the speed limit for the area despite snowy road conditions.

**Timeline:**

- 21:05 hours: Penttinen departed from Ruotsalanpuro heading westbound towards Kauppakatu intersection.
- 21:10 hours: Hietala entered the intersection from the south, proceeding along Kauppakatu.
- 21:14 hours: Penttinen approached the stop sign without coming to a complete stop, as observed by multiple witnesses.
- 21:15 hours: Collision occurred at the intersection, with Penttinen's vehicle striking Hietala’s passenger side.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The night was clear but the roads were covered in a light snowfall, reducing visibility and grip. The Finnish Meteorological Institute recorded approximately 2 cm of fresh snow over the preceding hours, contributing to slippery conditions. Tire tracks at the scene indicated reduced traction, aligning with witness observations of vehicles struggling to maintain control on the slick roads.

**Vehicle Damage:**

Hietala's Volvo V60 sustained significant damage to its passenger side, including a crumpled door, shattered window, and misaligned fender. Penttinen’s Toyota Corolla also showed impact damage on the front driver's side, consistent with the angle of collision. Both vehicles were towed from the scene for further examination and repair assessments.

**Conclusion:**

Preliminary investigation suggests that Jari Penttinen's failure to obey the stop sign was the primary causal factor in this collision. Weather conditions, while not the direct cause, played a role in reducing visibility and road grip, complicating both drivers' responses. Further analysis of vehicle data recorders (if available) and witness interviews will be conducted to ascertain full details and liability.
