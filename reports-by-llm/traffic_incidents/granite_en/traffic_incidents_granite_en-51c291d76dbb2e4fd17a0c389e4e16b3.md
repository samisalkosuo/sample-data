**Traffic Incident Report**

*Incident Number:* 2024-PMA-0929-001  
*Date of Incident:* 29th September 2024  
*Location:* Intersection of Kauppakatu and Ratinauksenranta, Pomarkku, Finland  
*Reporting Officer:* Inspector Jouko Hietala, Pomarkku Police Department  

**Narrative:**

On the evening of 29th September 2024, at approximately 18:30 hours, a four-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ratinauksenranta in Pomarkku, Finland. The incident involved a minor traffic accident under foggy conditions, resulting in property damage but no reported serious injuries.

The vehicles involved were:
1. A silver 2020 Toyota Corolla, registered as '123-FIN-A', driven by Ms. Anna Pietilä, a local resident of Kauppakatu 23.
2. A blue 2018 Volvo V60, registered as '456-FIN-B', operated by Mr. Mikko Kaski, who was en route to his home at Ratinauksenranta 19.
3. A red 2019 Ford Focus, identified with the registration '789-FIN-C', driven by Ms. Laura Virtanen, heading towards central Pomarkku from the outskirts.
4. A grey 2021 Honda Civic, bearing the license plate '012-FIN-D', driven by Mr. Jussi Rantala, a delivery driver for a local grocery store located on Kauppakatu.

**Timeline of Events:**

- At 18:25 hours, Ms. Pietilä was traveling westbound on Kauppakatu approaching the intersection with Ratinauksenranta. The foggy weather conditions reduced visibility to approximately 50 meters.
  
- Simultaneously, Mr. Kaski, in his Volvo, was proceeding northbound along Ratinauksenranta towards the same intersection. He reported noticing Ms. Pietilä's vehicle only when it was within 30 meters of the crossing due to the dense fog.

- Ms. Virtanen, driving her Ford Focus eastbound on Kauppakatu, encountered reduced visibility and misjudged the distance to the intersection, failing to stop in time.

- Mr. Rantala, in his Honda Civic, was waiting at a red light on Kauppakatu heading towards Ratinauksenranta. He proceeded through the intersection when the light turned green, unaware of the impending collision due to the fog's obscuring effect.

- The series of misjudgments and reduced visibility led to Ms. Virtanen colliding with Mr. Kaski’s Volvo at the intersection first, pushing it slightly sideways into Mr. Rantala’s path. Mr. Rantala, unable to react in time, collided with Ms. Virtanen's Ford Focus.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The prevailing weather condition during the incident was foggy, with visibility reduced to about 50 meters. The roads were damp due to intermittent light rain, compounding the hazardous conditions for drivers. There were no prior reports of road defects contributing to the accident.

**Damage Description:**

- Ms. Pietilä's Toyota Corolla sustained front-end damage, primarily to the passenger side, from debris impact during the secondary collision.
  
- Mr. Kaski’s Volvo V60 suffered significant damage to its front driver's side, including a bent hood and dented fender. The vehicle was pushed sideways into the path of Mr. Rantala.

- Ms. Virtanen's Ford Focus incurred substantial damage to its rear end, with the boot lid crumpled and tail lights shattered from the impact with the Volvo.

- Mr. Rantala’s Honda Civic experienced frontal damage, primarily affecting the passenger side, as it collided with Ms. Virtanen's vehicle.

**Witness Statements:**

Several pedestrians near the scene reported seeing the vehicles approaching cautiously but acknowledged that the fog severely limited their ability to provide detailed pre-collision observations. A passerby, Mr. Petteri Koskinen, noted that all involved drivers appeared shaken but walked around their vehicles to check for injuries and exchange information.

**Conclusion:**

The collision was a result of a chain reaction under adverse weather conditions, leading to misjudgments in stopping distances and vehicle positioning at the intersection. All parties involved cooperated fully with the investigation, and no criminal charges were warranted given the circumstances. Recommendations for all drivers include increased caution during foggy conditions and ensuring vehicles' headlights are set to 'main beam' when visibility is severely compromised.
