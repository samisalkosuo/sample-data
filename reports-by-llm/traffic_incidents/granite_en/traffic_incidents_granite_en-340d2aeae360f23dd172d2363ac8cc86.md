**Timeline of Events:**

- At approximately 09:13 hours, Ms. Pitkänen in the Volvo V60 initiated a left turn from Ruotsalanpuro onto Kauppakatu intending to head northbound.

- Simultaneously, Mr. Lappalainen in the Ford Focus, following closely behind Mr. Koskinen's Corolla, failed to reduce speed adequately for the approaching intersection.

- Ms. Mäkelä in the Civic, traveling westbound on Ruotsalanpuro, proceeded through the intersection intending to turn left onto Kauppakatu.

- Mr. Kivinen in the Qashqai was southbound on Kauppakatu and approaching the intersection from the opposite direction of Ms. Pitkänen's intended turn.

- Ms. Rantanen in the Audi A3 was eastbound on Ruotsalanpuro, approaching the intersection where Ms. Mäkelä was turning left.

- Mr. Virtanen in the Hyundai i30 entered Kauppakatu from a side street without yielding to oncoming traffic, including Mr. Koskinen's Corolla and Mr. Kivinen's Qashqai.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

Heavy rain was reported throughout the municipality of Parkano during this time, with visibility significantly reduced due to water accumulation on road surfaces. The wet conditions contributed to decreased traction, exacerbating the severity of the collision as vehicles struggled to maintain control, particularly at the intersection where speed limits are typically lower but may have been disregarded in the challenging weather.

**Damage Descriptions:**

- Mr. Koskinen's Corolla sustained front-end damage from the impact with Ms. Mäkelä's Civic.

- Ms. Pitkänen's Volvo V60 suffered significant damage to its right side, including the door and rear quarter panel, from collisions with both the Civic and Qashqai.

- Mr. Lappalainen's Ford Focus was pushed into the Volvo by the force of the impact, resulting in front-end and passenger side damage.

- Ms. Mäkelä's Civic received considerable damage to its left side, including the door and front quarter panel, from striking both the Volvo and Focus.

- Mr. Kivinen's Qashqai experienced heavy damage to its left front, colliding with the Volvo during its attempt to avoid the initial impacts.

- Ms. Rantanen's Audi A3 was rear-ended by Mr. Virtanen's Hyundai as she attempted to brake for the turning vehicles, causing moderate damage to the Audi’s rear.

- Mr. Virtanen's Hyundai sustained front-end damage from the subsequent collision with Ms. Rantanen's Audi after failing to stop in time.

**Witness Statements:**

Several pedestrians and occupants of nearby businesses provided consistent accounts, noting the heavy rainfall and reduced visibility. They also reported that all involved drivers appeared distracted or possibly impaired by the adverse weather conditions.

**Conclusion:**

The collision was a result of multiple factors including failure to yield right-of-way, inadequate speed for prevailing road conditions, and potential driver distraction due to heavy rain. All drivers involved will be cited for traffic violations as appropriate, with further investigation into possible contributing factors such as driver fatigue or impairment.
