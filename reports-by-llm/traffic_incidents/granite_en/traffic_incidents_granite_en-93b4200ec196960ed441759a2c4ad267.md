**Narrative:**

On the afternoon of 10 February 2025, at approximately 14:30 hours, a three-vehicle traffic incident occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ruotsalanpuro in Hollola, Finland. The vehicles involved were a silver 2019 Toyota Corolla, registered as FIN-123XY, driven by Mr. Mikko Kivinen, 34, of Kauppakatu 56; a blue 2020 Ford Focus, registered as FIN-456ZY, operated by Ms. Sanna Pietilä, 28, from Ruotsalanpuro 12; and a grey 2017 Volvo V60, identified with registration FIN-789AB, driven by Mr. Jussi Hietala, 45, residing at Kauppakatu 31.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **14:28 hours:** Ms. Pietilä, driving the Ford Focus, approached the intersection from the west on Ruotsalanpuro heading east towards Kauppakatu. Heavy rain was falling, reducing visibility and making road conditions slippery.
  
- **14:29 hours:** Mr. Kivinen, in the Corolla, entered the intersection from the south on Kauppakatu intending to turn left onto Ruotsalanpuro. He reportedly misjudged the speed of an oncoming vehicle, which turned out to be Mr. Hietala's Volvo approaching from the north.

- **14:30 hours:** The collision occurred when the front passenger side of Mr. Kivinen’s Corolla struck the rear driver's side of Mr. Hietala’s Volvo, pushing it into a spin. Simultaneously, Ms. Pietilä, unable to stop in time due to the wet road conditions, collided with the rear of Mr. Kivinen’s vehicle.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

Heavy rain was reported throughout Helsinki region, including Hollola, at the time of the incident. The precipitation led to poor visibility and slick road surfaces, contributing factors in the reduced reaction times of the drivers involved.

**Vehicle Damages:**

- The Toyota Corolla sustained significant damage to its front passenger side, including a crumpled fender and a dented door. Airbag deployment was noted, indicating a potential impact on the driver.
  
- The Volvo V60 suffered damage to its rear driver's side, with scrapes along the bodywork and a bent rear bumper. There were no reports of injuries from this vehicle.
  
- The Ford Focus received front-end damage, primarily affecting its hood and grille, as it struck the Corolla from behind.

**Witness Statements:**

A passerby, Ms. Leena Rantanen, provided a statement confirming she saw all three vehicles involved in the collision. She noted that Mr. Kivinen appeared distracted moments before the turn and that Ms. Pietilä braked hard but was unable to avoid colliding with the Corolla due to the slippery conditions.

**Action Taken:**

Emergency services were promptly dispatched, arriving on-scene within eight minutes. All parties involved were checked for injuries; minor cuts and bruises were reported by Mr. Kivinen and Ms. Pietilä. They were transported to Hollola Central Hospital for treatment. No serious injuries were sustained.

The vehicles were towed away, and the intersection was temporarily closed for a detailed investigation and cleanup. Road conditions were assessed, and temporary warning signs were erected to alert other drivers of the recent incident.

This report is submitted for further investigation and insurance claims processing. Further inquiries should be directed to Inspector Jouko Mäkelä at the Hollola Police Department.
