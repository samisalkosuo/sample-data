**Traffic Incident Report**

*Incident Number:* 2022-MU-1112  
*Date of Incident:* 12th November 2022  
*Location:* Intersection of Kauppakatu and Yli-Kallio, Muonio, Finland  
*Reporting Officer:* Inspector Jouko Hietala, Muonio Police Department  

**Narrative:**

On the afternoon of 12th November 2022, at approximately 14:35 hours, a three-vehicle traffic incident occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Yli-Kallio in the municipality of Muonio, Finland. The weather conditions were foggy, with reduced visibility affecting driver perception.

The vehicles involved were a grey 2018 Volvo V60 driven by Mr. Mikko Kivinen, residing at Kauppakatu 123; a white 2020 Toyota Corolla driven by Ms. Anna Pitkänen from Yli-Kallio 456; and a black 2017 Ford Focus driven by Mr. Jussi Rantala, residing at Kauppakatu 789.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **14:30 hours:** Ms. Pitkänen, driving her Toyota Corolla (license plate 123-TO-45), proceeded from the south on Yli-Kallio towards the intersection with Kauppakatu. Mr. Kivinen, in his Volvo V60 (license plate 45-VO-67), was waiting at the stop sign on Kauppakatu, intending to turn left onto Yli-Kallio.

- **14:32 hours:** Mr. Rantala, operating his Ford Focus (license plate 89-FO-76), approached from the east along Kauppakatu, heading towards the same intersection. The foggy conditions led to reduced visibility, impairing all drivers' ability to accurately gauge distances and speeds.

- **14:34 hours:** As Ms. Pitkänen's vehicle entered the intersection, she was unable to detect Mr. Kivinen’s Volvo due to the fog. Mr. Kivinen, misjudging the distance because of the limited visibility, initiated his left turn directly into Ms. Pitkänen's path.

- **14:35 hours:** Mr. Rantala, approaching from the east, observed Ms. Pitkänen’s vehicle but was unable to halt in time due to the slippery road conditions caused by the fog. He collided with the rear of Ms. Pitkänen's Toyota Corolla, pushing it further into the path of Mr. Kivinen's Volvo.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The prevailing weather at the time was foggy, with visibility reduced to approximately 100 meters. The road surface, although dry, had accumulated a thin layer of morning dew exacerbated by the fog, leading to slippery conditions. These factors significantly contributed to the drivers' inability to react appropriately and avoid the collision.

**Vehicle Damage:**

- Ms. Pitkänen's Toyota Corolla sustained damage primarily to the rear, including a bent rear bumper and minor frame distortion.

- Mr. Kivinen’s Volvo V60 incurred front-end damage, with the left front fender crumpled and the headlight shattered upon impact.

- Mr. Rantala's Ford Focus suffered significant rear-end damage, including a collapsed trunk lid and extensive scraping along its right side due to the subsequent sideswipe with Ms. Pitkänen’s vehicle.

**Witnesses:**

Two passersby, Ms. Leena Sipilä and Mr. Olli Mäkelä, witnessed the incident from a nearby café on Kauppakatu. They immediately contacted emergency services at 14:36 hours, reporting the accident and providing descriptions of the vehicles and drivers involved.

**Actions Taken:**

Emergency medical services were dispatched to the scene, arriving within eight minutes. All parties involved sustained minor injuries and were transported to Muonio Central Hospital for evaluation. The roads were temporarily closed for investigation and clearance, reopening by 15:15 hours.

This report is submitted for further investigation and insurance claims processing. Further inquiries should be directed to Inspector Jouko Hietala at the Muonio Police Department.
