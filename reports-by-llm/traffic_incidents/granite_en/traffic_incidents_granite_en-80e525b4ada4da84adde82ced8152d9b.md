**Traffic Incident Report**

*Incident Number:* 2024-RUS-0309  
*Date of Incident:* 09.03.2024  
*Location:* Intersection of Kauppakatu and Mannerheimintie, Rusko, Finland  
*Reporting Officer:* Inspector Jari Hietala  
*Municipality:* Rusko  

**Narrative:**

On the morning of 09.03.2024, at approximately 08:45, a multi-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Mannerheimintie in the municipality of Rusko, Finland. The incident involved eleven vehicles, resulting in various degrees of damage and minor injuries to the drivers and passengers.

The primary cause of the accident appears to be a combination of factors including overcast weather conditions reducing visibility and potentially contributing to driver misjudgment. Initial investigations suggest that Mr. Mikko Kivinen, 34, driving a silver 2018 Volvo V60 with license plate 92-ABC-12, proceeded through a green light on Kauppakatu without fully clearing the intersection due to reduced visibility.

As Mr. Kivinen entered the junction, he collided with a red 2015 Toyota Corolla driven by Ms. Anna Pitkänen, 29, whose vehicle was traveling along Mannerheimintie. The impact caused Mr. Kivinen's Volvo to spin, striking several other vehicles waiting at the traffic signal. These included a blue 2017 Ford Focus (license plate 34-DEF-56) driven by Mr. Jussi Laine, a green 2019 Hyundai i30 (license plate 78-GHI-90) driven by Ms. Leena Mäkelä, and a white 2016 Nissan Qashqai (license plate 56-JKL-87) driven by Mr. Olli Rantala.

Following the initial impacts, a chain reaction ensued as subsequent vehicles attempted to avoid collision. A grey 2018 BMW 3 Series (license plate 12-MNO-45), driven by Ms. Kaisa Sipilä, struck the rear of the Hyundai i30. Meanwhile, a black 2019 Dacia Sandero (license plate Q2-PQR-67) driven by Mr. Samuli Virtanen, collided with the side of the Nissan Qashqai.

Additional vehicles involved in the incident were a yellow 2016 Citroën C3 (license plate Z9-STU-78) driven by Ms. Eeva Koskinen, who was stopped behind the queue and struck from behind by a red 2014 Ford Fiesta (license plate Y1-VWX-01) driven by Mr. Jesse Tuominen; and two pedestrians, Mr. Petteri Hietala and Ms. Sanna Lehtinen, who were crossing within the designated crosswalk but had to abruptly halt due to the oncoming vehicles, narrowly avoiding being struck themselves.
