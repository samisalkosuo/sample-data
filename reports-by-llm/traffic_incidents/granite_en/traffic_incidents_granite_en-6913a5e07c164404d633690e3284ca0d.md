**Narrative:**

On the evening of 09.11.2023, at approximately 18:45 hours, a three-vehicle traffic incident occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ratinauksenranta in Forssa, Finland. The primary vehicles involved were a grey 2018 Volvo V60 driven by Mr. Mikko Koskinen, 34, residing at Kauppakatu 123; a silver 2020 Toyota Corolla, operated by Ms. Sanna Pitk채nen, 29, from Ratinauksenranta 456; and a black 2017 Ford Focus, driven by Mr. Jussi Lehtinen, 42, living at Kauppakatu 789.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **18:30 hours:** Heavy rain commenced in Forssa, significantly reducing visibility and creating slippery road conditions on Kauppakatu and Ratinauksenranta.

- **18:40 hours:** Mr. Koskinen, driving westbound on Kauppakatu towards the intersection, reportedly failed to stop at the clearly marked stop sign due to the adverse weather conditions.

- **18:42 hours:** Ms. Pitk채nen, traveling southbound on Ratinauksenranta, approached the intersection intending to turn left onto Kauppakatu. She reportedly misjudged Mr. Koskinen's speed and proceeded, colliding with the Volvo V60 as it entered the intersection.

- **18:43 hours:** Mr. Lehtinen, driving eastbound on Kauppakatu, encountered the initial collision between the Volvo and Toyota Corolla. Unable to stop in time due to the wet road surface, he collided with the rear of Ms. Pitk채nen's vehicle.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The weather on the day of the incident was characterized by persistent heavy rainfall, leading to poor visibility and slippery road surfaces. These conditions likely contributed to the drivers' misjudgments regarding speed and stopping distances.

**Vehicle Details and Damage:**

1. **Volvo V60 (Finland's license plate 123-MK):** Sustained significant front-end damage, including a crumpled hood and damaged headlights. Airbag deployment indicated occupant restraint during the collision.

**Witness Statements:**

Several pedestrians near the scene provided consistent accounts, noting the heavy rainfall and reduced visibility. A passerby, Ms. Eeva Kivinen, described seeing both vehicles approach the intersection at excessive speeds for the weather conditions before the collisions occurred.

**Investigation Status:**

The investigation is ongoing to determine liability fully, including potential charges related to reckless driving under adverse weather conditions. All drivers have been temporarily suspended from operating motor vehicles pending further inquiries and toxicology reports.
