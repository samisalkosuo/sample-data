**Narrative:**

On the afternoon of 24.10.23, at approximately 14:15 hours, a three-vehicle traffic incident occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ruotsalanpuro in the municipality of Kurikka, Finland. The drivers involved were identified as Mikael Andersson, a local baker residing at 23 Kauppakatu; Elina Pitkäranta, a school teacher from 45 Ruotsalanpuro; and Jussi Hietala, a construction worker living at 19 Kauppakatu.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **14:08 hours:** Elina Pitkäranta, driving her blue 2020 Toyota Corolla (Finnish license plate 123-ABC), proceeded from Ruotsalanpuro heading north towards Kauppakatu. The weather was windy with gusts, causing minor visibility issues.

- **14:10 hours:** Mikael Andersson, operating his red 2018 Ford Focus (Finnish license plate 456-DEF), turned left from Kauppakatu onto Ruotsalanpuro intending to head west. He failed to yield to oncoming traffic due to the windy conditions momentarily obscuring his view.

- **14:12 hours:** Jussi Hietala, driving his green 2015 Volkswagen Passat (Finnish license plate 789-GHI), approached from Ruotsalanpuro and was proceeding south towards Kauppakatu. He attempted to avoid a collision by braking but was unable to prevent impact due to slippery road conditions exacerbated by the wind gusts.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The prevailing weather at the time of the incident was described as windy with intermittent gusts, reducing visibility slightly. The roads were dry but the strong winds contributed to minor drifting of lighter vehicles and increased braking distances. No precipitation was reported.

**Vehicle Damage:**

- Mikael Andersson's Toyota Corolla sustained damage primarily to the front passenger side, including a dented fender and scratches along the door.

- Elina Pitkäranta's Ford Focus incurred significant damage to its right front end, with the hood crumpled and headlight shattered.

- Jussi Hietala's Volkswagen Passat showed impact on the left rear side, with a scraped rear quarter panel and minor paint transfer from the Corolla.

**Witness Statements:**

A passerby, Anna Kaski, provided a statement confirming she saw Mikael Andersson's vehicle make an unsignaled left turn directly into Elina Pitkäranta’s path. Another witness, Olli Rantala, noted the sudden gust of wind just before Jussi Hietala applied his brakes, contributing to the inability to avoid the collision fully.

**Conclusion:**

The incident appears to have resulted from a failure to yield and misjudgment of oncoming traffic due to adverse weather conditions. All drivers were cooperative during the investigation, and no citations for reckless driving were issued given the challenging circumstances. The report is submitted for further review and potential insurance claims processing.
