**Traffic Incident Report**

*Incident Number:* 2025-HIR-001  
*Date of Incident:* 12 February 2025  
*Location:* Intersection of Kauppakatu and Ratinkatu, Hirvensalmi, Finland  
*Reporting Officer:* Inspector Jouko Mäkelä, Hirvensalmi Police Department  

**Narrative:**

On the evening of 12 February 2025, at approximately 18:30 hours, a four-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ratinkatu in Hirvensalmi. The incident involved a red 2019 Toyota Corolla driven by Mr. Mikko Kivinen, 34, residing at Kauppakatu 12; a silver 2020 Volvo XC60 operated by Ms. Anna Pitkänen, 45, from Ratinkatu 30; a blue 2018 Ford Focus driven by Mr. Jussi Hietala, 27, living on Kauppakatu 45; and a white 2021 Hyundai Tucson under the control of Ms. Sanna Lehtinen, 30, from Ratinkatu 50.

**Timeline:**

- **18:25 hours:** Ms. Pitkänen, approaching the intersection from the north on Ratinkatu, encountered windy conditions with gusts affecting visibility and vehicle control. She maintained a cautious speed but struggled to fully assess oncoming traffic due to intermittent blind spots caused by parked vehicles along Kauppakatu.

- **18:27 hours:** Mr. Hietala, traveling southbound on Kauppakatu in his Ford Focus, was similarly affected by the windy conditions. He attempted to navigate around a slow-moving delivery truck, reducing his speed and increasing the risk of collision upon entering the intersection.

- **18:28 hours:** Mr. Kivinen, driving his Toyota Corolla eastward on Kauppakatu, was distracted momentarily by a passenger in the vehicle. This lapse in attention, coupled with the windy conditions, led him to fail to notice Ms. Pitkänen's Volvo entering the intersection.

- **18:29 hours:** Simultaneously, Ms. Lehtinen, driving her Hyundai Tucson north on Ratinkatu, was also impacted by the wind gusts, causing her vehicle to drift slightly towards the center of the road as she approached the intersection.

- **18:30 hours:** The collision ensued when Mr. Kivinen's Corolla struck Ms. Pitkänen's Volvo at a diagonal angle, subsequently being pushed into Mr. Hietala's Ford Focus. Ms. Lehtinen, unable to react in time due to the adverse weather and vehicle positioning, collided with the rear of Mr. Hietala’s Focus.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The prevailing weather conditions during the incident were windy with gusts, reducing visibility and making it challenging for drivers to maintain control, particularly at intersections where parked vehicles created additional blind spots. The road surface was dry but the strong winds contributed to the difficulty in maneuvering, especially for vehicles entering or exiting side streets.

**Vehicle Damage:**

- Mr. Kivinen's Toyota Corolla sustained significant front-end damage, including a collapsed front fender and airbag deployment. The vehicle was towed from the scene with license plate number 123-TO-45.

- Ms. Pitkänen's Volvo XC60 incurred damage to its passenger side, involving a dented door and scratches along the side panel. Its license plate read 789-VO-67.

- Mr. Hietala's Ford Focus suffered rear-end damage, with the trunk lid crumpled and taillights shattered. The vehicle’s license plate was 321-FO-89.

- Ms. Lehtinen's Hyundai Tucson had front-end damage, primarily affecting the bumper and grille area. Its license plate number is 654-HU-01.

**Witness Statements:**

Several pedestrians in the vicinity provided consistent accounts of the windy conditions and the difficulty drivers faced in navigating the intersection safely. A nearby café owner, Mr. Petteri Rantanen, confirmed witnessing Ms. Lehtinen's vehicle drifting before the collision occurred.

**Conclusion:**

The collision was primarily caused by a combination of driver distraction (Mr. Kivinen), adverse weather conditions (windy with gusts), and challenging road geometry exacerbated by parked vehicles obstructing views at the intersection. All parties involved were transported to Hirvensalmi Central Hospital for medical evaluation, fortunately with no reported life-threatening injuries.

This report is submitted for further investigation and insurance claims processing. Further inquiries should be directed to Inspector Jouko Mäkelä at the Hirvensalmi Police Department.
