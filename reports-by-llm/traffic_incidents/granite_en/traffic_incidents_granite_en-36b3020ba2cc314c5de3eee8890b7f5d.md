**Narrative:**

On the night of 10th July 2024, at approximately 23:15 hours, a two-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Elimäki and Kauppiaksenravintola Roads in Karijoki, Finland. The incident involved a grey 2018 Volvo V60, registered with the license plate 923-YOK, driven by Mr. Mikko Koskinen, a 45-year-old local resident of Elimäki 12A, and a silver 2020 Toyota Corolla, identified by its license plate 875-JOK, operated by Ms. Anna Pitkänen, a 32-year-old residing at Kauppiaksenravintola 45B.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **23:10 hours:** Ms. Pitkänen was driving eastbound on Kauppiaksenravintola Road towards the intersection, proceeding at a moderate speed under overcast weather conditions which reduced visibility. Mr. Koskinen, traveling northbound on Elimäki Road, approached the intersection intending to turn left onto Kauppiaksenravintola Road.

- **23:14 hours:** As Ms. Pitkänen neared the intersection, she observed Mr. Koskinen's vehicle preparing to make a left turn but misjudged its intentions due to poor visibility from the overcast skies. She applied her brakes but was unable to prevent a collision as the vehicles collided in the intersection.

- **23:15 hours:** The Volvo V60, driven by Mr. Koskinen, sustained damage primarily to its front passenger side, including a dented fender and a scraped bumper. The Toyota Corolla, under Ms. Pitkänen's control, incurred damage on the driver’s side, with a crumpled door and a broken headlight.

**Witnesses:**

A passerby, Mr. Jari Lehtinen from Elimäki 8C, witnessed the incident and immediately contacted emergency services at 23:16 hours. He reported that both drivers appeared shaken but uninjured.

**Weather Conditions:**

The overcast weather significantly reduced visibility, contributing to Ms. Pitkänen's delayed reaction time as she approached the intersection. There were no precipitation issues reported, only diminished lighting due to cloud cover.

**Damage Assessment:**

- The Volvo V60 required towing and sustained an estimated repair cost of €3,500 for bodywork repairs.
- The Toyota Corolla also needed towing with an estimated repair cost of €2,800 for the driver's side damages.

**Conclusion:**

The collision was determined to be a result of misjudgment in intersection navigation under reduced visibility conditions rather than any reckless driving or violation of traffic laws. Both drivers were issued warnings for failure to yield right-of-way, acknowledging their responsibility in the incident. No further action was deemed necessary beyond ensuring both parties exchanged insurance details and filed claims with their respective providers.
