**Timeline of Events:**

- **08:38**: Drivers A and B approached the intersection from Kauppakatu heading north towards Ruotsalanpuro. Driver C was also traveling north on Kauppakatu, while Driver D turned onto Kauppakatu from a side street on Ruotsalanpuro, intending to head north.
- **08:40**: As Driver A neared the intersection, visibility was compromised by mixed snow and rain, reducing traction on the road surface. Driver B, proceeding cautiously, activated hazard lights as a precaution.
- **08:42**: Driver C, following closely behind Driver A, failed to reduce speed adequately for the adverse weather conditions. Driver D, entering from Ruotsalanpuro, misjudged the oncoming traffic and proceeded without yielding the right of way.
- **08:43**: The collision ensued as Driver C's Ford Focus collided with the rear of Driver B’s Toyota Corolla, pushing it into the intersection. Simultaneously, Driver D's Honda Civic, unable to stop in time, struck the front of Driver A’s Volvo V60.
- **08:44**: All vehicles came to a halt, with minor damages sustained. No passengers reported injuries, though all drivers experienced mild whiplash due to the sudden stops.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The prevailing weather at the time of the incident was mixed snow and light rain, significantly reducing visibility and road grip. The roads were damp from the ongoing precipitation, exacerbating the risk of skidding.

**Vehicle Damages:**

- **Volvo V60 (Driver A)**: Front bumper sustained minor dents; no significant structural damage reported.
- **Toyota Corolla (Driver B)**: Rear end suffered scratches and a slightly bent rear bumper.
- **Ford Focus (Driver C)**: Front grille and hood exhibited cosmetic damage, with no mechanical issues identified.
- **Honda Civic (Driver D)**: Minor front-end scuffing on the bumper; otherwise intact.

**Conclusion:**

The collision was primarily caused by Driver C's failure to adjust speed for hazardous weather conditions and insufficient following distance, coupled with Driver D’s misjudgment of traffic flow. All drivers were cited for minor traffic violations related to failing to yield right of way and driving too fast for conditions. No further action is required beyond the issuance of citations, given the absence of serious injuries or extensive property damage.
