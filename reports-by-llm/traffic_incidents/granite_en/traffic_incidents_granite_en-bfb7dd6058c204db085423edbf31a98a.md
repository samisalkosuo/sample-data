*Location:* Intersection of Kauppakatu and Mäkelänkatu, Rautalampi, Finland

**Narrative:**

On the evening of 19 February 2024, at approximately 17:30 hours, a multi-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Mäkelänkatu in Rautalampi, Finland. The incident involved eleven vehicles, resulting in various degrees of damage and minor injuries to the drivers and passengers.

The primary sequence of events unfolded as follows:

At 17:25 hours, a white 2019 Toyota Corolla, registered KY-12345, driven by Mr. Mikko Koskinen, 34, of Mäkelänkatu 23, proceeded northbound on Mäkelänkatu approaching the intersection with Kauppakatu. Simultaneously, a silver 2020 Volvo XC60, registered VO-67890, driven by Ms. Sanna Pitkäranta, 41, of Kauppakatu 111, was traveling eastbound on Kauppakatu.

As Mr. Koskinen's vehicle entered the intersection, it collided with the passenger side of Ms. Pitkäranta's Volvo. The impact caused Ms. Pitkäranta's vehicle to spin, striking several other vehicles waiting at the red light on Kauppakatu. These included a black 2018 Ford Focus (FO-2345), driven by Ms. Laura Mäkelä, 29; a blue 2017 Honda Civic (CV-6789), driven by Mr. Jussi Rantala, 32; and a red 2021 Nissan Leaf (NL-0123), driven by Ms. Anna Kaski, 25.

The force of these initial collisions propelled the Honda Civic into the path of an oncoming green 2016 BMW 3 Series (BM-4567), driven by Mr. Olli Miettinen, 50, heading westbound on Kauppakatu. The BMW collided with the Civic, pushing it further into the intersection where it struck a grey 2019 Audi A4 (AU-8901), driven by Ms. Kaisa Lehtinen, 38, and a yellow 2020 Hyundai i30 (HI-2468), driven by Mr. Samuli Hietala, 45.

Meanwhile, the initial collision between the Toyota Corolla and Volvo XC60 also set off a chain reaction. The Corolla spun around, impacting a white 2017 Renault Clio (CL-3456), driven by Ms. Eeva Kivinen, 22, stopped at the red light on Mäkelänkatu. Subsequently, the Corolla collided with a dark blue 2019 Dacia Sandero (DA-7890), driven by Mr. Teppo Virtanen, 60, traveling southbound on Mäkelänkatu.

The final vehicle involved was a cyclist, Mr. Jari Pekkarinen, 42, who was navigating the intersection on his bicycle when he was struck by debris from the multiple collisions. He sustained minor injuries and was transported to the Rautalampi Hospital for evaluation.

**Conclusion:**
