**Traffic Incident Report**

*Incident Number:* 2025-KOS-001  
*Date of Incident:* 17th February 2025  
*Location:* Intersection of Elimen Puistokaupunkuln and Kaupunkintie, Koski Tl, Finland  
*Reporting Officer:* Jari P. Korhonen, Badge #4923  

**Narrative:**

On the evening of 17th February 2025, at approximately 18:15 hours, a three-vehicle traffic incident occurred at the intersection of Elimen Puistokaupunkuln and Kaupunkintie in Koski Township, Finland. The primary contributing factors were mixed snow and rain, which significantly reduced visibility and created slippery road conditions.

The vehicles involved were a silver 2019 Toyota Corolla driven by Ms. Aino Mäkelä, 34, of Elimen Puistokaupunkuln 12; a blue 2020 Ford Focus driven by Mr. Jussi Hietala, 47, residing at Kaupunkintie 56; and a grey 2018 Volkswagen Passat driven by Ms. Sanna Rantanen, 30, from Kaupunkintie 99.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **18:07 hours:** Mr. Hietala, driving the Ford Focus, approached the intersection from the north on Kaupunkintie heading south towards Elimen Puistokaupunkuln. Ms. Mäkelä in her Corolla was waiting at the stop sign on Elimen Puistokaupunkuln intending to turn left onto Kaupunkintie.

- **18:09 hours:** Ms. Rantanen, driving the Passat, was traveling southbound on Kaupunkintie towards the same intersection. She reportedly reduced her speed due to the adverse weather conditions but maintained a steady course.

- **18:12 hours:** As Mr. Hietala's vehicle neared the intersection, he observed Ms. Mäkelä’s Corolla preparing to turn left. However, given the poor visibility from the mixed snow and rain, he misjudged her intentions and failed to fully apply his brakes in time.

- **18:13 hours:** Mr. Hietala's Ford Focus collided with the passenger side of Ms. Mäkelä’s Corolla. The impact caused both vehicles to spin, with the Corolla coming to rest facing eastbound on Elimen Puistokaupunkuln and the Ford Focus stopping westbound on Kaupunkintie.

- **18:14 hours:** Ms. Rantanen, approaching cautiously due to weather conditions, attempted to brake but was unable to avoid colliding with the rear of Mr. Hietala's Ford Focus, pushing it further into the intersection. Her Passat sustained damage to the front bumper and hood, while the Focus received additional rear-end damage.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The prevailing weather at the time was a mixture of snow and rain, leading to reduced visibility and slippery road surfaces. The Finnish Meteorological Institute reported that the temperature was just above freezing (2°C), with intermittent precipitation turning partly to snow. These conditions were deemed hazardous for driving, contributing significantly to the severity of the incident.

**Vehicle Damage:**

- Ms. Mäkelä's Toyota Corolla: Passenger side door and fender sustained significant damage; airbags deployed.  
- Mr. Hietala's Ford Focus: Front passenger side suffered a collapsed door, while the rear was impacted by Ms. Rantanen’s vehicle.  
- Ms. Rantanen's Volkswagen Passat: Front bumper and hood were crumpled from the collision with the Ford Focus.

**Injuries:**

Ms. Mäkelä reported minor injuries, primarily from the airbag deployment. Mr. Hietala sustained a sprain to his right wrist upon impact with the steering wheel. Ms. Rantanen was unharmed but shaken by the incident. All parties were transported to Koski Central Hospital for evaluation and treatment.

**Witness Statements:**

A passerby, Mr. Olli Pekkarinen, provided a corroborating account of the events from his nearby residence on Elimen Puistokaupunkuln 20. He reported hearing screeching tires and the sound of impact before rushing to assist.

**Conclusion:**

The incident was primarily caused by the adverse weather conditions, which impaired visibility and road grip, leading to a misjudgment in Mr. Hietala's braking action. Secondary factors included potential driver distraction or fatigue, though these cannot be definitively confirmed without further investigation.

This report is submitted for review and further action as deemed necessary by the Koski Police Department Traffic Division.
