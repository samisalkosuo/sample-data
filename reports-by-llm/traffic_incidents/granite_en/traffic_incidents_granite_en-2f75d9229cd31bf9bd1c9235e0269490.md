**Narrative:**

On the afternoon of 29th January 2025, at approximately 14:30 hours, a two-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ratinkatu in Punkalaidun, Finland. The incident involved a white 2018 Toyota Corolla, registered with the license plate '67-AJK-12', driven by Mr. Mikko Koskinen, a 34-year-old local resident, and a silver 2020 Volvo XC60, identified by its license plate '89-VXL-34', operated by Ms. Anna Pitkänen, a 29-year-old resident of the neighbouring municipality of Savonlinna.

**Timeline of Events:**

1. **14:25 hours**: Mr. Koskinen, driving his Toyota Corolla eastbound on Kauppakatu, approached the intersection intending to turn left onto Ratinkatu. Ms. Pitkänen, in her Volvo XC60, was travelling southbound on Ratinkatu, preparing to turn right onto Kauppakatu.

2. **14:28 hours**: Both drivers activated their respective turn signals, indicating their intentions to other road users. The weather conditions were dry but cold, with a temperature of -5°C and clear visibility.

3. **14:30 hours**: As Mr. Koskinen's vehicle entered the intersection, it was struck on its passenger side by the Volvo XC60 operated by Ms. Pitkänen. The impact caused significant damage to both vehicles; the Corolla sustained a dented passenger door and a cracked headlight, while the Volvo XC60 received damage to its front bumper and hood.

4. **14:32 hours**: Emergency services were alerted, and they arrived at the scene within 7 minutes. Both drivers sustained minor injuries and were transported to Punkalaidun Hospital for evaluation. No passengers were present in either vehicle.

**Witness Statements:**

1. **Ms. Leena Rantanen**, a local shopkeeper at address Kauppakatu 56, witnessed the incident and confirmed that both drivers signalled their intentions clearly before entering the intersection. She also noted that there were no other vehicles or pedestrians in close proximity that could have influenced the collision.

2. **Mr. Jari Kivinen**, a passerby walking his dog along Ratinkatu, corroborated Ms. Rantanen's account and added that the road surface was dry with no discernible ice or debris that might have contributed to the accident.

**Vehicle Information:**

- **Toyota Corolla**: Driven by Mikko Koskinen, license plate '67-AJK-12'. Sustained damage to the passenger side, including a dented door and cracked headlight.

- **Volvo XC60**: Operated by Anna Pitkänen, license plate '89-VXL-34'. Damage was noted on the front bumper and hood area.

**Conclusion:**

The collision appears to have resulted from a miscalculation of speed or distance rather than any reckless driving behaviour. Both drivers indicated their intentions clearly, and there were no external factors such as poor road conditions or obstructed views reported by witnesses. The investigation is ongoing to determine the precise cause, including potential contributing factors such as driver error or momentary lapses in attention.
