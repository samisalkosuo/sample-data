**Narrative:**

On the night of 29th January 2024, at approximately 23:45 hours, a three-vehicle traffic incident occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ruotsalanpuro in Kuhmoinen. The vehicles involved were a silver 2018 Toyota Corolla, registered as '123-KY', driven by Mr. Mikko Koskinen, 34, residing at Kauppakatu 56; a blue 2020 Ford Focus, identified by its plate '456-KU', operated by Ms. Sanna Pietilä, 29, from Ruotsalanpuro 12; and a grey 2017 Volvo V60, marked with the license '789-KH', driven by Mr. Jussi Lehtinen, 45, living at Kauppakatu 89.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **23:40 hours:** Ms. Pietilä, driving her Ford Focus southbound on Ruotsalanpuro, approached the uncontrolled intersection with Kauppakatu. The road was dry but cold, with visibility unimpeded by adverse weather conditions.

- **23:41 hours:** Mr. Koskinen, in his Toyota Corolla, was traveling westbound on Kauppakatu towards the intersection. He was within the speed limit and maintained a safe distance from the stop line.

- **23:42 hours:** Mr. Lehtinen, driving the Volvo V60 eastbound on Kauppakatu, proceeded cautiously but failed to fully halt at the stop sign controlling entry onto Ruotsalanpuro. His vehicle entered the intersection simultaneously with Ms. Pietilä's Ford Focus.

- **23:43 hours:** The front-end collision ensued as Mr. Lehtinen’s Volvo struck the passenger side of Ms. Pietilä's Ford Focus. The impact propelled Ms. Pietilä's vehicle into a rotational spin, subsequently colliding with Mr. Koskinen's Toyota Corolla on its driver's side.

**Witness Statements:**

A passerby, Ms. Aino Mäkelä, provided a statement confirming she witnessed the entire sequence of events from a nearby residential driveway. She noted that Mr. Lehtinen did not come to a complete stop at the stop sign and appeared to misjudge the speed of oncoming traffic.

**Damage Description:**

- The Volvo V60 sustained significant damage to its front end, including a crumpled hood and a damaged headlight. Airbag deployment was noted in the passenger seat.

- The Ford Focus incurred side panel damage, a bent passenger door, and a shattered side window. Its airbags also deployed during the collision.

- The Toyota Corolla displayed dents on its driver's side door and minor scuffing to the front bumper from the secondary impact.

**Weather Conditions:**

The night was clear with temperatures around -5°C, providing dry road conditions but contributing to reduced visibility due to the absence of streetlights in certain sections leading up to the intersection.

**Conclusion:**

This report details a multi-vehicle collision resulting from a failure to adhere to traffic signals, compounded by cold weather conditions affecting driver alertness and reaction times. Further investigation is underway to determine if additional factors contributed to this incident. All drivers were transported to the nearest hospital for assessment of minor injuries. Charges are being considered against Mr. Lehtinen for failing to stop at a stop sign.
