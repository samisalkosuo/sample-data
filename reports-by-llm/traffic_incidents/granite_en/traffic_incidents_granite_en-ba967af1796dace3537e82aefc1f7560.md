**Timeline of Events:**

- At 14:28 hours, Mr. Rantala in the Ford Focus approached the intersection with a green light.
- Ms. Pietilä in the Toyota Corolla, proceeding eastbound on Kauppakatu, failed to stop at the stop sign and entered the intersection, colliding with Mr. Rantala's vehicle.
- Simultaneously, Ms. Lehtinen in the Volkswagen Golf, also traveling eastbound, attempted to avoid the collision but was unable to halt in time, striking the rear of Ms. Pietilä's Corolla.
- Mr. Mäkelä in the Honda Civic, heading south on Ruotsalanpuro, collided with Ms. Kivinen’s Nissan Qashqai as it turned left into his path.
- The force of this collision caused the Qashqai to spin, striking Ms. Koskinen's Hyundai i20 that was following closely behind.
- Mr. Virtanen in the Dacia Sandero, traveling southbound on Ruotsalanpuro, was unable to stop and collided with the rear of the Volkswagen Golf, exacerbating the chain reaction.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The incident occurred during a thunderstorm, with heavy rainfall reducing visibility and creating slippery road conditions. The storm had begun around 14:00 hours, intensifying by the time of the collision. Lightning strikes were reported nearby, possibly contributing to driver distraction or reduced reaction times.
