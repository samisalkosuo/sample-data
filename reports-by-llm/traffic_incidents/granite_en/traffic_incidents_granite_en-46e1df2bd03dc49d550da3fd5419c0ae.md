**Traffic Incident Report**

*Incident Number:* 2024-02-28-HAM-001  
*Date of Incident:* 28 February 2024  
*Location:* Intersection of Kauppakatu and Ratinkatu, Hammarland, Finland  
*Reporting Officer:* Inspector Jouko Mäkelä, Hammarland Police Department  

**Narrative:**

On the morning of 28 February 2024, at approximately 09:15 hours, a multi-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ratinkatu in the municipality of Hammarland, Finland. The incident involved ten vehicles, resulting in various degrees of damage and minor injuries to the drivers and passengers.

The primary cause of the accident appears to be reduced visibility due to dense fog that enveloped the area during the early morning hours. At the time, the weather conditions were described as 'foggy' by meteorological services, with visibility reduced to approximately 100 meters. This adverse weather significantly impaired drivers' ability to perceive and react to traffic signals and other vehicles.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **09:05 hours:** Fog begins to descend over Hammarland, reducing visibility significantly.
- **09:10 hours:** Vehicle 1 (a white Volvo V60, license plate 34-FIN-123, driven by Mr. Mikko Koskinen, 45, from nearby Lahti) approaches the intersection on Kauppakatu, misjudges the distance due to fog and fails to stop at the red light.
- **09:11 hours:** Vehicle 2 (a blue Ford Focus, license plate 78-FIN-456, driven by Ms. Anna Pitkänen, 32, a local resident) is traveling along Ratinkatu and proceeds through the intersection, struck broadside by Vehicle 1.
- **09:12 hours:** The impact causes a chain reaction, with Vehicles 3 to 10 (a mix of sedans, SUVs, and trucks) colliding in succession as they attempt to avoid or mitigate the initial crash.

**Vehicular Details and Damages:**

- **Vehicle 1:** Volvo V60 - suffered substantial frontal damage, airbags deployed; Mr. Koskinen sustained minor injuries.
- **Vehicle 2:** Ford Focus - severe side impact damage; Ms. Pitkänen reported whiplash.
- **Vehicles 3 to 10:** A range of makes including a Toyota Corolla, Nissan Qashqai, and a Mercedes-Benz Sprinter van, all exhibited varying degrees of collision damage. No serious structural failures were noted.

**Witness Statements:**

Several pedestrians and occupants of nearby businesses provided consistent accounts corroborating the sequence of events. Notably, Ms. Liisa Rantala, a café owner on Kauppakatu, reported seeing Vehicle 1 approach at an unusually high speed despite the foggy conditions.

**Road Conditions:**

The intersection, while well-lit, was slick from overnight dew exacerbated by the fog, contributing to reduced traction for vehicles. Road signs and traffic signals were visible but their effectiveness in alerting drivers was compromised by the poor visibility.

**Conclusion:**

This incident underscores the critical importance of adjusting driving behavior under adverse weather conditions such as fog. All involved parties are reminded to reduce speed, increase following distances, and remain vigilant when visibility is compromised. The Hammarland Police Department will continue to monitor weather-related traffic safety and may implement additional measures if necessary.
