**Narrative of Events:**

On the evening of 03.07.2025, at approximately 18:20 hrs, a two-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppiaselkä and Ristimäenkangas in Savonlinna, Finland. The drivers involved were identified as Mikko Hietala, a 34-year-old local resident of Kauppiaselkä 23, and Anna Pitkänen, a 28-year-old residing at Ristimäenkangas 15.

Hietala was driving his 2018 Volvo V60 with Finnish license plate 123-AB-45 towards the north on Kauppiaselkä, approaching the intersection with Ristimäenkangas. Meanwhile, Pitkänen was operating her 2020 Toyota Corolla, bearing the license plate number 678-XY-90, traveling eastbound along Ristimäenkangas.

As Hietala entered the intersection, he reportedly failed to yield to oncoming traffic, colliding with Pitkänen's vehicle. The impact occurred on the passenger side of both vehicles, causing significant damage. Witnesses, including a local shopkeeper named Marko Rantanen from nearby Kauppiaselkä Market, corroborated that Hietala had proceeded through a stop sign without coming to a complete stop, contributing to the severity of the collision.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The evening was characterized by intermittent snowfall, reducing visibility and creating slippery road conditions. The snow had accumulated unevenly on Kauppiaselkä and Ristimäenkangas, contributing to Hietala's inability to navigate the intersection safely.

**Vehicle Damage:**

Hietala’s Volvo V60 sustained substantial damage to its passenger side, including a crumpled front fender and a dented door. The airbags deployed during the impact. Pitkänen's Toyota Corolla also suffered significant damage on the passenger side, with a bent frame and scrapes along the vehicle’s length.

**Witness Statements:**

Marko Rantanen, who witnessed the incident from his shop across the street, confirmed that Hietala did not come to a complete stop at the stop sign before entering the intersection. Another passerby, student Elina Kivinen, provided a similar account and noted that the snowy conditions might have impaired Hietala's judgment and control over his vehicle.

**Action Taken:**

Mikko Hietala was administered a preliminary breath test, which did not detect alcohol. However, due to the adverse weather conditions and failure to yield, he was placed under arrest for reckless driving and issued a citation. Anna Pitkänen sought medical attention at the scene for minor injuries but declined transport to the hospital.

This report is submitted in good faith and based on the information gathered at the scene. Further investigation may be required if additional evidence comes to light.
