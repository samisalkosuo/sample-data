**Traffic Incident Report**

*Incident Number:* 230605-AKA-01  
*Date of Incident:* 05.06.2023  
*Location:* Intersection of Kauppakatu and Ruohoniekentie, Akaa, Finland  
*Reporting Officer:* Jari P. Korhonen, Akaa Police Department  

**Narrative:**

On the evening of 05.06.2023, at approximately 21:45 hours, a two-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ruohoniekentie in Akaa, Finland. The vehicles involved were a grey 2018 Toyota Corolla, registered with the license plate 34-AKK-12, driven by Mr. Mikko Hietala, 35, of Kauppakatu 12, Akaa, and a silver 2020 Ford Focus, registered with the license plate 78-AKA-99, operated by Ms. Anna Pitkänen, 27, of Ruohoniekentie 45, Akaa.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **21:30 hours:** Heavy rainfall commenced in the Akaa region, reducing visibility and creating slippery road conditions on Kauppakatu and Ruohoniekentie.
  
- **21:40 hours:** Mr. Hietala, driving westbound on Kauppakatu towards its intersection with Ruohoniekentie, approached the stop sign. Witnesses reported that he failed to fully halt at the stop line due to the wet road surface causing his vehicle to slide slightly.

- **21:42 hours:** Ms. Pitkänen, traveling southbound on Ruohoniekentie, approached the intersection. She reportedly observed Mr. Hietala's vehicle but misjudged its speed and proximity due to the heavy rain and poor visibility.

- **21:43 hours:** The collision occurred when Ms. Pitkänen's Ford Focus struck the passenger side of Mr. Hietala's Toyota Corolla as she proceeded through the intersection. The impact caused both vehicles to spin, with the Corolla coming to rest facing eastbound on Ruohoniekentie and the Focus stopping perpendicular to its original path on Kauppakatu.

**Witness Statements:**

- A passerby, Mr. Jussi Lehtinen, provided a statement confirming he saw both vehicles approaching the intersection cautiously but noted that Mr. Hietala's car did not come to a complete stop before entering the crossroads.

- Another witness, Ms. Laura Kivimäki, who was driving in the opposite direction on Kauppakatu, reported seeing Ms. Pitkänen's vehicle enter the intersection after Mr. Hietala had partially entered it, suggesting a possible misjudgment of distance and speed due to adverse weather conditions.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The heavy rainfall significantly impaired visibility and created hazardous road conditions, contributing to both drivers' inability to react appropriately to the traffic situation. The Finnish Meteorological Institute recorded 45 mm of precipitation in Akaa between 21:00 and 22:00 hours on the date in question, exacerbating the already saturated road surfaces.

**Vehicle Damage:**

- The Toyota Corolla sustained damage to its passenger side door, fender, and rear quarter panel. Airbag deployment was noted, indicating occupant presence.

- The Ford Focus incurred front-end damage, including a crumpled hood and damage to the driver's side headlight and bumper.

**Injuries:**

Mr. Hietala reported minor injuries consistent with airbag deployment. Ms. Pitkänen was uninjured but visibly shaken. Both were transported to Akaa Central Hospital for evaluation as a precautionary measure.

**Action Taken:**

The intersection was temporarily closed for investigation and subsequent clearing of debris. Both drivers were issued citations for failure to obey traffic signals and driving under adverse conditions. The vehicles were towed from the scene, and further analysis will be conducted to determine if additional factors contributed to the collision, such as vehicle mechanical issues exacerbated by the weather.

This report is submitted for review and follow-up actions in accordance with Akaa Police Department protocols. Further inquiries should be directed to Officer Jari P. Korhonen at the Akaa Police Department.
