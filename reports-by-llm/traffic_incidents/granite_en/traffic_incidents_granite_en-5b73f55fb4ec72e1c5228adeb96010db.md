**Narrative:**

On the evening of 30.07.2023, at approximately 21:45 hours, a two-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Rannamäki in the municipality of Kumlinge, Finland. The incident involved a white 2018 Volvo XC60, registered with the license plate 34-VLO-FI, driven by Mr. Mikko Koskinen, 35, a local resident of Rannamäki 12, and a silver 2019 Toyota Corolla, registered with the license plate 23-TCO-FI, operated by Ms. Anna Pitkänen, 28, residing at Kauppakatu 45.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **21:40 hours:** Mr. Koskinen was driving southbound on Kauppakatu towards the intersection with Rannamäki, proceeding at a moderate speed under snowy conditions. Ms. Pitkänen was traveling westbound on Rannamäki, approaching the same intersection.

- **21:42 hours:** As Mr. Koskinen neared the intersection, he observed Ms. Pitkänen's vehicle not coming to a stop at the stop sign on Rannamäki. Despite applying brakes and activating hazard lights, a collision ensued when Ms. Pitkänen's Corolla proceeded into the intersection, striking the passenger side of Mr. Koskinen's Volvo.

- **21:43 hours:** The impact caused both vehicles to come to an immediate stop within the intersection. Witnesses, including Ms. Liisa Rantala from nearby residence Kauppakatu 50, confirmed that Ms. Pitkänen had failed to yield the right of way.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The roads were covered in a light layer of snow, reducing visibility and traction. The snowfall, though not heavy, combined with reduced lighting due to the nighttime hour, contributed to challenging driving conditions.

**Vehicle Damage:**

- The Volvo XC60 sustained damage primarily to its passenger side, including a dented door, scraped paintwork, and a broken headlight.

- The Toyota Corolla incurred front-end damage, with the front bumper and grille crumpled, alongside minor scuff marks on the driver's side.

**Witnesses:**

Ms. Liisa Rantala provided a statement confirming that Ms. Pitkänen had not come to a complete stop at the stop sign before entering the intersection. No other passengers were involved in either vehicle, and no injuries were reported.

**Conclusion:**

The collision was determined to be primarily caused by Ms. Pitkänen's failure to obey the traffic sign at the intersection. While weather conditions played a role in reducing visibility and road grip, they did not excuse the violation of traffic laws. Ms. Pitkänen was issued a citation for failing to yield the right of way under Finnish Road Traffic Act §32(1). Both drivers were advised to exercise caution during adverse weather conditions.
