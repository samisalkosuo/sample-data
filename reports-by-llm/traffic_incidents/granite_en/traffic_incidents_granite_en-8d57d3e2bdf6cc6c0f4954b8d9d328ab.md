**Incident Summary:**

On the night of 09.04.2025, at approximately 23:15 hours, a three-vehicle collision occurred on Kauppakatu Street in Parkano, Finland. The incident involved a sedan, a light truck, and a motorcycle, resulting in minor injuries to the drivers.

**Narrative:**

At the time of the incident, 34-year-old local resident, Mikko Koskinen, was driving his 2018 Volvo S60 sedan, registered under license plate 123-AB-45, eastbound on Kauppakatu Street towards the town center. The road, known for its slight curves, was slick due to icy conditions stemming from overnight frost.

Following closely behind, 47-year-old tradesman, Jouko Hietala, navigated his 2016 Ford Transit light truck, registered as 567-CD-89, carrying construction materials to a job site on Kauppatori Avenue. Hietala was attempting to overtake Koskinen's sedan when the incident occurred.

Meanwhile, 29-year-old delivery driver, Anna Pitkänen, rode her 2020 Yamaha XJR1300 motorcycle, registered with plate number 987-EF-65, westbound on Kauppakatu Street. She was approaching the intersection with Kauppatori Avenue when Hietala's vehicle began its overtaking maneuver, colliding with Koskinen’s sedan in the process. The impact caused Koskinen to lose control, his vehicle drifting into Pitkänen's path.

**Witnesses:**

A passerby, 52-year-old Eeva Mäkelä, witnessed the incident from her residence at 123 Kauppakatu and immediately called emergency services. Another witness, 30-year-old local student, Teppo Rantanen, who was driving a nearby uninvolved vehicle, stopped to assist and provided statements corroborating the sequence of events.

**Timeline:**

- 23:10 hours: Overnight frost sets in, leading to icy road conditions on Kauppakatu Street.
- 23:14 hours: Hietala initiates overtaking maneuver, noticing Koskinen's sedan ahead.
- 23:15 hours: Hietala's vehicle collides with Koskinen’s sedan; Koskinen loses control, drifting into Pitkänen's path.
- 23:16 hours: Pitkänen attempts to avoid collision but is unable to prevent contact with Koskinen’s vehicle.
- 23:17 hours: Emergency services arrive at the scene; Mäkelä and Rantanen provide initial statements.

**Vehicle Damage:**

Koskinen's Volvo S60 sustained damage to the front passenger side, including a dented fender and scratches along the paneling. The airbag deployed during the impact, indicating moderate force.

Hietala’s Ford Transit suffered significant damage to the driver's side, with a crumpled door and scrapes along the truck bed. Construction materials spilled onto the road but did not contribute to the collision dynamics.

Pitkänen's Yamaha motorcycle incurred damage to the right side, including a bent fairing and scuff marks on the exhaust pipe. She sustained minor abrasions consistent with a slide across the icy pavement.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The roads were icy due to overnight frost, contributing to reduced traction and increased stopping distances. Visibility was moderate under street lighting, but the icy conditions heightened the risk of loss of control for all vehicles involved.

**Conclusion:**

The collision was primarily caused by icy road conditions leading to compromised vehicle control, exacerbated by Hietala's attempt to overtake in challenging weather. All drivers were cited for driving without due care and attention under the prevailing conditions. Injuries sustained were minor, with all parties receiving on-site medical attention before transport to Parkano Central Hospital for further evaluation.
