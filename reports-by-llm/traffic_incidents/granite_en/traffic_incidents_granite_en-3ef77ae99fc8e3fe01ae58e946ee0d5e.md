**Timeline of Events:**

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The day was clear with temperatures around 12°C, classified as dry but cold weather conditions. The roads were dry, providing good traction, yet the chill may have affected driver alertness. There were no adverse weather factors contributing to the incident.
