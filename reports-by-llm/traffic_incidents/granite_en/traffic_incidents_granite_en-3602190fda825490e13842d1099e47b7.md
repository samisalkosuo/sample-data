**Narrative:**

On the evening of 16 May 2023, at approximately 21:45 hours, a four-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ratinauksenmäki in Sonkajärvi, Finland. The incident involved a Ford Focus driven by Mr. Mikko Koskinen, age 34, residing at Kauppakatu 12; a Volvo S60 driven by Ms. Anna Pitkänen, age 28, from Ratinauksenmäki 5; a Toyota Corolla operated by Mr. Jussi Lappalainen, age 41, living on Kauppakatu 30; and a Honda Civic driven by Ms. Sanna Virtanen, age 25, from Ratinauksenmäki 10.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **21:40 hours:** Ms. Pitkänen, driving north on Kauppakatu towards the intersection, encountered icy road conditions. She maintained a cautious speed but struggled to control her vehicle due to the slippery surface.
  
- **21:41 hours:** Mr. Lappalainen, traveling east along Ratinauksenmäki, approached the intersection intending to turn left onto Kauppakatu. He reduced speed but was similarly affected by the icy roads.

- **21:42 hours:** Mr. Koskinen, heading south on Kauppakatu, failed to notice Ms. Pitkänen's slowed vehicle due to glare from oncoming headlights and the challenging road conditions. He continued at a moderate speed.

- **21:43 hours:** Ms. Virtanen, proceeding west on Ratinauksenmäki, aimed to turn right onto Kauppakatu. She too was hindered by the icy roads and reduced her speed accordingly.

- **21:44 hours:** The collision occurred when Mr. Koskinen's Ford Focus collided with Ms. Pitkänen's Volvo S60 at the intersection, pushing it further into the path of Mr. Lappalainen's Toyota Corolla. Simultaneously, Ms. Virtanen's Honda Civic, unable to stop in time, struck the rear of Mr. Lappalainen’s vehicle.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The roads were reported icy due to overnight freezing temperatures following light snowfall earlier in the day. Visibility was moderately reduced by streetlights and occasional fog, exacerbating the hazardous conditions for drivers.

**Vehicle Details and Damage:**

1. **Ford Focus (Koskinen):** License plate 123-FO-12; sustained significant frontal damage, including a crumpled hood and damaged headlights. Airbags deployed during the initial impact.
   
2. **Volvo S60 (Pitkänen):** License plate 456-VO-98; suffered damage to the passenger side, with a bent door and scrapes along the vehicle's length from the subsequent collision with the Corolla.

**Witness Statements:**

Several passersby, including Ms. Laura Rantanen and Mr. Olli Mäkelä from nearby residences on Kauppakatu, provided consistent accounts of the events leading up to the collision, noting the icy conditions and reduced visibility.

**Investigation Findings:**

Preliminary investigation suggests that while all drivers adhered to speed limits for the given road conditions, the icy roads significantly impaired vehicle control, contributing to the multi-vehicle incident. No evidence of reckless driving or intoxication was found. All parties involved were cooperative and provided consistent statements regarding the events.

**Action Taken:**

Emergency services responded promptly, with paramedics attending to minor injuries sustained by Ms. Pitkänen and Ms. Virtanen. The vehicles were towed to a secure location for further examination.
