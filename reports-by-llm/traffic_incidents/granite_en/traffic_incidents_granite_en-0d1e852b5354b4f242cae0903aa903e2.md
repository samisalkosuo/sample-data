**Narrative:**

On the morning of 19th January 2025, at approximately 08:45, a two-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ratinauksenranta in the municipality of Lapua, Finland. The vehicles involved were a white 2019 Toyota Corolla, registered with the license plate 34-LAP-12, driven by Mr. Mikko Koskinen, a local teacher residing at 22 Aurinkolaan, and a grey 2020 Ford Focus, registered with the license plate 78-LAP-91, operated by Ms. Sanna Pitkänen, a nurse from 15 Kauppakatu.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **08:30**: Mr. Koskinen, driving his Toyota Corolla southbound on Kauppakatu, approached the intersection intending to turn left onto Ratinauksenranta towards his workplace at Lapuan Hospital. Ms. Pitkänen, in her Ford Focus, was travelling northbound on Kauppakatu en route to drop off her child at a nearby daycare centre before heading to her shift at the local health clinic.

- **08:35**: As Mr. Koskinen prepared to make his left turn, Ms. Pitkänen continued north, maintaining a speed of approximately 40 km/h in the 50 km/h zone. The road was covered with a light layer of snow, reducing visibility and traction.

- **08:40**: Mr. Koskinen initiated his left turn without fully ensuring it was safe, misjudging the distance and speed of Ms. Pitkänen's approaching vehicle due to reduced visibility from the snowfall.

- **08:45**: The front passenger side of Ms. Pitkänen’s Ford Focus collided with the driver's side of Mr. Koskinen's Toyota Corolla. Both vehicles came to a stop, partially blocking the intersection.

**Witnesses and Immediate Response:**

Two pedestrians, Ms. Aino Lehtinen and Mr. Olavi Mäkelä, who were walking their dogs on adjacent sidewalks, witnessed the incident. They immediately contacted emergency services at 08:47, reporting the collision and providing assistance to the drivers until the arrival of Lapua Police and emergency medical services.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The morning was characterized by intermittent snowfall, reducing visibility and creating slippery road conditions. The temperature was just above freezing at -1°C, with snow accumulating on the roads, particularly in shaded areas. These conditions contributed to the reduced traction and increased reaction times for both drivers.

**Vehicle Damage:**

The Toyota Corolla sustained significant damage to its driver's side door and front panel, with visible scrapes and dents. The Ford Focus incurred damage to its passenger side front fender and hood, alongside minor scratches on the vehicle’s bodywork. Both vehicles were towed from the scene for further inspection and repair.

**Summary:**

This report details a two-vehicle collision resulting from a misjudged left turn in snowy conditions. The drivers, Mr. Mikko Koskinen and Ms. Sanna Pitkänen, were transported to the nearest hospital for precautionary checks following the incident. No serious injuries were reported, though both drivers sustained minor cuts and bruises. Further investigation is ongoing to determine if additional factors contributed to the accident, including potential vehicle malfunctions or driver distractions.
