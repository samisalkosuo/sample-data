**Narrative:**

On the afternoon of 08th March 2024, at approximately 14:30 hours, a multi-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Pohjolanpuu Road and Keskusvuorinaukio in Kuopio, Finland. The incident involved five vehicles under heavy rainfall, which significantly impacted visibility and road conditions.

The primary vehicles involved were:

1. A grey 2019 Toyota Corolla, registered KY-12345, driven by Ms. Anna Pietilä, a local resident of Valtionpuistikenttä 12, Kuopio. She was traveling eastbound on Pohjolanpuu Road towards the intersection.

2. A blue 2020 Ford Focus, registered LU-67890, driven by Mr. Mikko Rantala, a student residing at Studentflats Kuopio, Keskuspuistari 34. He was proceeding northbound on Keskusvuorinaukio, approaching the intersection from the right.

3. A white 2018 Volkswagen Passat, registered OY-23456, driven by Ms. Laura Hämäläinen, a teacher at Kuopion Lukio, residing at Rannikko 56. She was heading westbound on Pohjolanpuu Road and intending to turn left onto Keskusvuorinaukio.

4. A red 2017 Honda Civic, registered JO-78910, driven by Mr. Samuli Koskinen, a construction worker from Pohjoiskari 3, Kuopio. He was traveling behind the Passat on Pohjolanpuu Road, also intending to turn left at the intersection.

5. A black 2016 BMW X1, registered VO-34567, driven by Ms. Sanna Kivinen, a nurse at Kuopio University Hospital, living at Hospitalroad 9, Kuopio. She was proceeding straight through the intersection on Keskusvuorinaukio from south to north.

**Timeline of Events:**

- At 14:28 hours, Ms. Pietilä in the Corolla approached the stop sign on Pohjolanpuu Road. Due to heavy rain reducing visibility, she failed to notice Mr. Rantala's Focus turning right from Keskusvuorinaukio onto Pohjolanpuu Road.

- At 14:29 hours, Ms. Hämäläinen in the Passat, signaling a left turn, began moving into the intersection. Mr. Koskinen, following closely behind in the Civic, also signaled and started his turn maneuver.

- Simultaneously, at 14:29:30 hours, Ms. Kivinen in the BMW X1 entered the intersection intending to proceed straight through, unaware of the impending turns by both the Passat and Civic due to the adverse weather conditions obscuring her view.

- The Corolla, driven by Ms. Pietilä, collided with the Focus driven by Mr. Rantala at the side, pushing it into the Pathat's path. This initial impact triggered a chain reaction.

- At 14:29:35 hours, the Passat, driven by Ms. Hämäläinen, was struck on its passenger side by the Corolla and continued moving forward, colliding with the Civic driven by Mr. Koskinen. The Civic spun around, striking a nearby traffic sign before coming to a halt.

- Finally, at 14:29:40 hours, the BMW X1, driven by Ms. Kivinen, collided with the rear of the Passat, exacerbating the damage and bringing all vehicles to a stop in a disarray across the intersection.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

Heavy rain was falling throughout the incident, significantly reducing visibility. The roads were wet, contributing to decreased traction for the vehicles involved. No skid marks were found at the scene, suggesting that all drivers maintained control of their vehicles until impact, but the combination of heavy rain and turning maneuvers led to miscalculations and collisions.

**Vehicle Damage:**

1. The Corolla (KY-12345) sustained damage primarily to its front passenger side, with significant denting and paint transfer.

2. The Focus (LU-67890) received damage to its right rear quarter panel and door, alongside misalignment of the rear wheels.

3. The Passat (OY-23456) suffered extensive damage on its passenger side, including a crumpled door and significant structural deformation.

4. The Civic (JO-78910) had its front end collapsed due to the impact with the Passat, rendering it inoperable.

5. The BMW X1 (VO-34567) showed heavy damage to its rear, including a smashed trunk and deformed rear bumper, from its collision with the Passat.

**Witness Statements:**

Several pedestrians witnessed the incident from a nearby café on Keskusvuorinaukio. They reported that all vehicles involved were traveling at moderate speeds and that none appeared to be exceeding the 50 km/h speed limit for urban areas prior to the collision.

**Conclusion:**

The multi-vehicle accident was primarily caused by the combination of heavy rain reducing visibility and drivers' misjudgments during turning maneuvers at a busy intersection. All parties involved were cooperative, and no serious injuries were reported, though minor injuries were treated on-site by emergency medical services. The investigation is ongoing to determine liability, with a focus on driver awareness in adverse weather conditions.
