**Narrative:**

On 01 January 2023, at approximately 14:30, the Kauhajoki Police Department responded to a three-vehicle traffic incident at the intersection of Etelä-Karja and Kauppakatu in Kauhajoki, Finland. The vehicles involved were operated by the following individuals:

1. **Driver A:** Mikael Johansson, 45 years old, residing at Hietala 23, Kauhajoki. He was driving a blue 2018 Volvo V60 with Finnish license plate 123-AB-45.
2. **Driver B:** Anna-Liisa Pitkänen, 32 years old, residing at Metsäntie 18, Kauhajoki. She was operating a red 2016 Ford Focus with Finnish license plate 678-XY-90.
3. **Driver C:** Olli Virtanen, 54 years old, residing at Kauppiaksenpuisto 34, Kauhajoki. He was in control of a grey 2019 Toyota Corolla with Finnish license plate 345-EF-67.

**Timeline of Events:**

- At approximately 14:28, Driver A was proceeding southbound on Etelä-Karja towards the intersection intending to turn left onto Kauppakatu.
- Simultaneously, at around 14:28, Driver B was traveling northbound on Etelä-Karja and approaching the same intersection, intending to continue straight through.
- Driver C was heading eastbound on Kauppakatu and preparing to turn left onto southbound Etelä-Karja.

As Driver A's Volvo entered the intersection to make a left turn, it collided with Driver B's Ford Focus, which was proceeding through the intersection in the straight-through lane. The impact caused both vehicles to spin, with the Volvo coming to rest facing northbound on Kauppakatu and the Focus stopping diagonally across the intersection.

Meanwhile, Driver C, approaching from the east, attempted to navigate the intersection but was unable to avoid colliding with the Volvo as it spun into his path. The Corolla struck the Volvo's rear passenger side, pushing it further into the intersection.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The incident occurred during a thunderstorm, with heavy rainfall reducing visibility and creating slippery road conditions. Lightning strikes were reported in the vicinity around the time of the accident, possibly contributing to driver distraction or reduced reaction times.

**Vehicle Damage:**

- The Volvo V60 sustained significant damage to its front passenger side and rear, with the airbags deployed.
- The Ford Focus incurred damage to its front driver's side and hood, along with front airbag deployment.
- The Toyota Corolla showed damage to its left front side, consistent with impact from the Volvo.

**Witness Statements:**

Several pedestrians witnessed the incident and provided statements corroborating the sequence of events. Notably, a local resident, Mr. Petri Hietala, reported seeing the lightning strike nearby just moments before the collision, suggesting possible environmental factors influencing driver behavior.

**Conclusion:**

The traffic incident resulted from a chain reaction initiated by Driver A's attempt to make a left turn during adverse weather conditions. All drivers involved were transported to the Kauhajoki Central Hospital for assessment and treatment of minor injuries. No further criminal charges are anticipated at this time, though investigations into potential contributing factors, such as weather impacts, remain ongoing.
