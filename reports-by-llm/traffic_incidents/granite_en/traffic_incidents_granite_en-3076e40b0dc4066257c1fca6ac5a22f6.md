**Narrative:**

On the morning of 07.06.23, at approximately 08:45, a three-vehicle traffic incident occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ratinauksenranta in the municipality of Muonio, Finland. The vehicles involved were a silver 2019 Toyota Corolla, registered as FIN-123A, driven by Mr. Mikko Koskinen, 34, of Kauppakatu 12; a blue 2020 Ford Focus, registered as FIN-456B, operated by Ms. Sanna Pitkänen, 28, of Ratinauksenranta 3; and a grey 2017 Volvo V60, identified as FIN-789C, driven by Mr. Jussi Lehtinen, 45, residing at Kauppakatu 5.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **08:38**: Ms. Pitkänen, driving the Ford Focus, approached the intersection from the west on Ratinauksenranta, intending to turn left onto Kauppakatu. Mr. Koskinen, in the Corolla, was proceeding east along Kauppakatu towards the same intersection.
- **08:40**: Mr. Lehtinen, driving the Volvo, entered the intersection from the north on an auxiliary lane of Kauppakatu, aiming to continue straight ahead. Light rain was falling, reducing visibility and making the asphalt slippery.
- **08:42**: As Ms. Pitkänen initiated her left turn, she misjudged the speed and distance of Mr. Koskinen's approaching vehicle. The front passenger side of the Corolla collided with the left rear quarter panel of the Focus.
- **08:43**: Startled by the initial impact, Ms. Pitkänen overcorrected, causing her vehicle to drift into the path of Mr. Lehtinen's Volvo. The Volvo struck the Focus near its rear driver's side, pushing it further across the intersection.
- **08:44**: Both vehicles came to a stop, partially blocking Kauppakatu. The Corolla, having been pushed slightly, came to rest against a traffic signpost, sustaining damage to its front bumper and hood.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The incident occurred under light rain conditions, which contributed to reduced visibility and slippery road surfaces. While not severe enough to warrant road closure, the weather played a role in the misjudgment of distances and speeds by the drivers involved.

**Vehicle Damage Descriptions:**

1. **Toyota Corolla (FIN-123A)**: Front passenger side suffered significant damage, including a dented door and scratches along the side panel. The front bumper was pushed inward.
2. **Ford Focus (FIN-456B)**: Left rear quarter panel sustained a scratch and paint transfer, while the left rear door showed minor dents. The vehicle also had damage to its rear bumper.
3. **Volvo V60 (FIN-789C)**: Rear driver's side panel exhibited scratches and paint transfer, with minor denting on the corresponding door. The Volvo's front bumper showed signs of impact but was otherwise functional.

**Witnesses:**

Two pedestrians, Ms. Aino Mäkelä and Mr. Olli Virtanen, witnessed the incident from a nearby café on Kauppakatu. They provided statements corroborating the sequence of events and described the weather conditions at the time.

**Action Taken:**

All drivers were transported to Muonio Hospital for precautionary checks, reporting no serious injuries. The vehicles were towed to a secure yard for further inspection and evidence collection. Traffic was rerouted temporarily while the scene was cleared. No citations were issued at the scene pending the investigation's completion.
