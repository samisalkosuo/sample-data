*Date of Incident:* 20 February 2024

**Narrative:**

On the evening of 20 February 2024, at approximately 21:30 hours, a two-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ratinauksenranta in the municipality of Luhanka, Finland. The incident involved a white 2019 Volvo XC60, registered with the license plate 123-ABC, driven by Mr. Mikko Hietanen, a 45-year-old local resident, and a silver 2020 Toyota Corolla, bearing the license plate 456-DEF, operated by Ms. Anna Kaski, a 32-year-old resident of nearby Kuhmo.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **21:28 hours:** Ms. Kaski, driving westbound on Ratinauksenranta towards the intersection, encountered reduced visibility due to dense fog rolling in from the nearby lake. She maintained a cautious speed, utilizing her vehicle's fog lights.

- **21:29 hours:** Mr. Hietanen, traveling northbound on Kauppakatu approaching the intersection, also encountered the foggy conditions. Despite his headlights being on high beam, visibility was severely compromised.

- **21:30 hours:** As both vehicles neared the intersection, Mr. Hietanen proceeded without fully clearing the crossing path, misjudging the distance due to the fog's obscuring effects. The Volvo XC60 collided with the passenger side of Ms. Kaski’s Toyota Corolla, which was in the process of entering the intersection.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The prevailing weather condition at the time of the incident was foggy, significantly reducing visibility to less than 50 meters. The roads were dry but the combination of nighttime darkness and fog created hazardous driving conditions. No road maintenance or advisories were in place prior to the incident.

**Vehicle Damage:**

The Volvo XC60 sustained substantial damage to its passenger side, including a crumpled front fender, a dented door, and a shattered headlight. The Toyota Corolla incurred damage to its rear passenger quarter panel, with scratches and a bent bumper. Both vehicles were towed from the scene for further examination and repair.

**Witnesses:**

A passing motorist, Mr. Petteri Koskinen, traveling eastbound on Ratinauksenranta, stopped to assist. He provided a statement confirming the fog's impact on visibility and corroborated the sequence of events leading up to the collision.

**Conclusion:**

The incident appears to be a result of impaired visibility due to adverse weather conditions compounded by the time of day. Both drivers acted prudently under the circumstances, but the confluence of factors led to this unfortunate collision. No immediate signs of driver impairment were detected, and both parties cooperated fully with the investigation.
