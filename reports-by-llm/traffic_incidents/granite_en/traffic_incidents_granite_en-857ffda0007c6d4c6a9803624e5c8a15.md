**Timeline of Events:**

- At 18:43 hours, Anna Pietilä's Toyota Corolla approached the stop sign on Rannikontie, where she reportedly paused briefly before proceeding cautiously into the intersection.
- Mikael Kivinen in the Volvo V60 was traveling south on Kauppakatu at a moderate speed, unaware of Pietilä's intent to turn left.
- Jussi Laine in the Ford Focus was also northbound on Kauppakatu, following Kivinen closely but maintaining a safe distance.
- Eeva Rantanen, intending to turn left from Rannikontie onto Kauppakatu, entered the intersection without yielding to oncoming traffic due to slippery road conditions caused by recent rainfall.
- Olli Mäkelä in the Audi A4 was traveling east on Rannikontie, approaching the intersection where he encountered Pietilä's vehicle entering his path.
- Sanna Virtanen, driving the Nissan Qashqai, was southbound on Kauppakatu, nearing the intersection, unaware of the impending collision due to reduced visibility from heavy cloud cover.
- Teppo Hietala in the Mercedes Sprinter was northbound on Kauppakati, attempting to overtake Laine's Focus when Rantanen's Civic collided with Pietilä’s Corolla.
- Kaisa Pitkäranta, entering from Rannikontie, struck Hietala's Sprinter as he attempted to avoid the collision involving Laine and Rantanen.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The roads were wet and slippery due to intermittent rainfall in the hours preceding the incident. Visibility was moderately reduced by overcast skies, contributing to drivers' diminished awareness of each other's movements.

**Vehicle Damages:**

1. **Volvo V60 (Mikael Kivinen):** Front-end damage from impact with Rantanen’s Civic.
2. **Toyota Corolla (Anna Pietilä):** Significant frontal and left-side damage from collision with Laine's Focus.
3. **Ford Focus (Jussi Laine):** Minor rear-end damage from contact with Hietala's Sprinter.
4. **Honda Civic (Eeva Rantanen):** Left-side impact, causing the vehicle to spin and collide with Mäkelä’s Audi.

6. **Nissan Qashqai (Sanna Virtanen):** Side panel damage from contact with Hietala’s Sprinter.

8. **Ford Mustang Mach-E (Kaisa Pitkäranta):** Frontal damage from impact with Hietala’s Sprinter.

**Witness Statements:**

Multiple witnesses, including passersby and occupants of nearby businesses on Kauppakatu, reported the events to emergency services. A consistent account was gathered indicating that all drivers involved appeared to be cautious but perhaps overly reliant on their vehicle's anti-lock braking systems given the slippery conditions.

**Conclusion:**

The collision appears to have been a result of misjudged distances, failure to yield, and reduced visibility due to adverse weather conditions. All drivers involved are cooperating with the investigation, and no criminal charges have been filed at this time. The incident serves as a reminder for drivers to adjust their speed and caution during inclement weather, ensuring they remain vigilant and aware of all traffic signals and road signs.
