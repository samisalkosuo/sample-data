**Narrative of Events:**

On the morning of 24.11.2023, at approximately 08:45 hours, a two-vehicle collision occurred in the central area of Kärkölä, Finland. The incident took place at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ruotsalan katu, where Kauppakatu, a major thoroughfare, intersects with the quieter Ruotsalan katu.

The vehicles involved were a silver 2018 Toyota Corolla, registered under the name of Sari Mäkelä from nearby Helsinki, and a blue 2020 Ford Focus driven by local resident, Marko Kivinen. Both drivers were traveling towards the center of Kärkölä.

According to witness statements, Ms. Mäkelä was proceeding cautiously along Kauppakatu due to light rain affecting visibility. Mr. Kivinen, approaching from Ruotsalan katu, attempted to navigate the intersection but misjudged the speed of oncoming traffic. His vehicle collided with the passenger side of Ms. Mäkelä's Corolla as she proceeded through the junction.

**Timeline of Events:**

- 08:40 hours: Light rain begins in Kärkölä, reducing visibility.
- 08:42 hours: Marko Kivinen departs from his residence on Ruotsalan katu, heading towards Kauppakatu.
- 08:43 hours: Sari Mäkelä leaves her accommodation on Kauppakatu, traveling southbound.
- 08:44 hours: Marko Kivinen reaches the intersection of Ruotsalan katu and Kauppakatu.
- 08:45 hours: Collision occurs as Mr. Kivinen's Ford Focus strikes Ms. Mäkelä’s Toyota Corolla.
- 08:46 hours: Emergency services are alerted, and first responders arrive at the scene within five minutes.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The prevailing weather condition during the incident was light rain, which reduced visibility and likely contributed to Mr. Kivinen's misjudgment of the oncoming traffic. The roads were damp but not icy, providing adequate traction for vehicles. However, the combination of reduced visibility and potentially cautious driving due to the weather may have played a role in the accident.

**Vehicle Details and Damage:**

- **Toyota Corolla (Ms. Mäkelä):** The passenger side of the vehicle sustained significant damage, including a dented door, a shattered side window, and scrapes along the paneling. Ms. Mäkelä reported minor bruising but no serious injuries.
- **Ford Focus (Mr. Kivinen):** The front passenger side of Mr. Kivinen's vehicle showed signs of impact, with damage to the front bumper and hood. He was unharmed.

**Witness Statements:**

Several pedestrians witnessed the incident and provided consistent accounts. Notably, a local shopkeeper, Olli Pitkäranta, from the nearby store at Kauppakatu 12, reported seeing both vehicles just before the collision and heard the sound of screeching tires from Mr. Kivinen's car moments prior to impact.

**Conclusion:**

The collision appears to have resulted from a misjudgment by Mr. Kivinen regarding the speed and proximity of Ms. Mäkelä’s vehicle, compounded by reduced visibility due to light rain. No criminal negligence is suspected, and both drivers cooperated fully with the investigation.

This report is submitted for further review and action as deemed necessary.
