**Timeline of Events:**

- At 14:30, Mr. Kivinen, in the Volvo V60, approached the intersection from the west, signaling a right turn onto Rautatieasema.
- Ms. Pitkänen, driving the Toyota Corolla, was traveling north on Rautatieasema, intending to turn left onto Kauppakatu.
- As Mr. Kivinen entered the intersection, Ms. Pitkänen's vehicle collided with the passenger side of his Volvo V60. This impact caused a chain reaction, involving subsequent vehicles that were either following or approaching the intersection.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The weather on the day of the incident was clear and sunny, with no precipitation or adverse conditions reported. However, the glare from the sun, positioned low in the sky due to the time of year, may have temporarily impaired visibility for some drivers. The roads were dry, and there were no prior reports of hazardous conditions.

**Damage Descriptions:**

- Volvo V60 (Kivinen): Significant damage to the passenger side, including a crumpled door and fender, with airbag deployment noted.
- Toyota Corolla (Pitkänen): Front-end damage, primarily affecting the driver's side. Airbags deployed.
- Ford Focus (Lehtinen): Rear-end collision, minor cosmetic damage.
- Honda Civic (Mäkelä): Side impact, resulting in dented passenger door and scratches along the vehicle’s side.

**Witness Statements:**

Several witnesses were present at nearby businesses and residences, providing consistent accounts of the events leading up to the collision. Notable observations included Ms. Pitkänen's vehicle appearing to accelerate slightly before the impact and Mr. Kivinen signaling his intent to turn right well in advance.

**Conclusion:**

The investigation concluded that the primary cause of the incident was a failure by Ms. Pitkänen to yield the right-of-way to Mr. Kivinen, exacerbated by low sun glare affecting visibility. All drivers involved were cited for traffic violations where applicable, and further recommendations were made regarding driver awareness in challenging light conditions.
