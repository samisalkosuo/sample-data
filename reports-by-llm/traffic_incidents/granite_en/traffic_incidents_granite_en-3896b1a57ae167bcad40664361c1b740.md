**Narrative:**

On the morning of 29 January 2023, at approximately 08:45, a four-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ruotsalanpuro in the municipality of Jomala, Finland. The incident involved a minor traffic accident under icy road conditions, resulting in property damage but no reported serious injuries.

The vehicles involved were:
1. A silver 2018 Toyota Corolla, registered as '123-FO', driven by Ms. Anna Pitkäranta, a local teacher residing at Kauppakatu 45.
2. A blue 2020 Ford Focus, registered as 'ABC-12', operated by Mr. Jussi Rantala, a construction worker from Ruotsalanpuro 18.
3. A grey 2016 Volkswagen Golf, identified by its registration 'DEF-45', driven by Ms. Laura Kaski, a university student living on Kauppakatu 21.
4. A white 2019 Honda Civic, bearing the license plate 'GHI-78', driven by Mr. Samuli Miettinen, an IT consultant from Ruotsalanpuro 34.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **08:35:** Ms. Pitkäranten was traveling southbound on Kauppakatu approaching the intersection with Ruotsalanpuro. Mr. Rantala, in his Ford Focus, was heading east along Ruotsalanpuro. Ms. Kaski in her Volkswagen Golf was also approaching from the west on Ruotsalanpuro.
- **08:40:** As Ms. Pitkäranten neared the intersection, she applied her brakes due to the icy conditions but encountered a delay in stopping because of reduced traction. Simultaneously, Mr. Rantala proceeded through the intersection without noticing Ms. Pitkäranten's vehicle, assuming it would have stopped in time.
- **08:42:** Ms. Kaski, following closely behind Mr. Rantala, attempted to brake but skidded on the icy road, colliding with the rear of Mr. Rantala’s Ford Focus. This impact pushed Mr. Rantala's vehicle into the intersection, where it was struck by Ms. Pitkäranten's Toyota Corolla, which had just cleared the stop line.
- **08:43:** Mr. Miettinen, driving the Honda Civic, was traveling east on Ruotsalanpuro and attempted to avoid the collision by swerving but lost control on the icy surface, skidding into a nearby snowbank.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The roads were covered with a thin layer of ice due to overnight freezing rain, contributing to reduced traction for all vehicles involved. Visibility was clear, but drivers had to contend with hazardous road conditions typical of early morning in Finland during winter.

**Damage Description:**

- Ms. Pitkäranten's Toyota Corolla sustained damage to the front passenger side, including a dented fender and scratches along the door.
- Mr. Rantala’s Ford Focus suffered significant rear-end damage, with the trunk lid crumpled and taillights shattered.
- Ms. Kaski's Volkswagen Golf had front-end damage, including a bent hood and damage to the grille area.
- Mr. Miettinen’s Honda Civic sustained minor cosmetic damage to its front bumper after striking the snowbank.

**Conclusion:**

All drivers were issued warnings for failing to adapt their driving to the icy road conditions. No citations were issued due to the lack of serious injuries and the acknowledgment by all parties of their respective negligence in adjusting speed for the hazardous weather. The Finnish Meteorological Institute was notified regarding the overnight ice accumulation, which may have contributed to the severity of the minor collisions.
