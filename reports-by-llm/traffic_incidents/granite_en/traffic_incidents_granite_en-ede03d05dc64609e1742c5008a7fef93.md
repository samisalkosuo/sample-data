**Narrative:**

On the afternoon of 14 June 2024, at approximately 14:30 hours, a two-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Pohjoiskarinkuunpuu in Rauma, Finland. The incident involved a grey 2018 Volvo V60, registered with the license plate 92-ABC-DF, driven by Mr. Mikko Kivinen, a 45-year-old local resident of Kauppakatu 23, and a white 2020 Toyota Corolla, registered with the license plate 34-XYZ-12, operated by Ms. Anna Pitk채nen, a 30-year-old resident of Pohjoiskarinkuunpuu 15.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **14:28 hours:** Ms. Pitk채nen, driving her Toyota Corolla eastbound on Pohjoiskarinkuunpuu, approached the intersection intending to turn left onto Kauppakatu. Mr. Kivinen, in his Volvo V60, was travelling southbound along Kauppakatu.
- **14:29 hours:** Fog, reducing visibility to approximately 50 metres, began to roll into the area, obscuring road signs and traffic signals.
- **14:30 hours:** Ms. Pitk채nen initiated her left turn without fully clearing oncoming traffic due to reduced visibility. Mr. Kivinen, unable to stop in time, collided with the passenger side of Ms. Pitk채nen's vehicle.
- **14:31 hours:** Both drivers brought their vehicles to a halt. A passerby, Mr. Jari Lehtinen from Kauppakatu 18, stopped to assist and confirmed that neither driver appeared to have sustained serious injuries.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

At the time of the incident, a dense fog bank had settled over Rauma, reducing visibility significantly. The roads were dry but the adverse weather conditions contributed to the drivers' inability to perceive each other's movements clearly, leading to the collision.

**Vehicle Damage:**

The Volvo V60 sustained damage primarily to its passenger side, including a dented door and scratches along the side panel. The Toyota Corolla incurred damage to its front passenger quarter-panel, with a minor scrape and paint transfer from the Volvo. Both vehicles were driven from the scene under police escort for further inspection.

**Witnesses:**

Mr. Jari Lehtinen provided a statement confirming the sequence of events and attesting to the foggy conditions prevailing at the time of the incident. No other direct witnesses came forward, though CCTV footage from a nearby business is being reviewed as part of the ongoing investigation.

**Action Taken:**

Both drivers were transported to Rauma Central Hospital for precautionary checks and released with minor injuries. The vehicles have been impounded for further inspection, and the police are investigating potential charges related to careless driving due to adverse weather conditions.
