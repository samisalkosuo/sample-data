On the evening of 15th January 2024, at approximately 18:30 hours, a multi-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ratinauksenkatu in the municipality of Lapua, Finland. The incident involved nine vehicles, resulting in various degrees of damage and minor injuries to the occupants.

The primary vehicles involved were:

1. A silver 2020 Toyota Corolla, registered as FIN-123XY, driven by Ms. Sanna Koskinen, 34, residing at Kauppakatu 123, Lapua. Ms. Koskinen was proceeding westbound on Kauppakatu towards the intersection.

2. A blue 2018 Ford Focus, registered as FIN-456ZY, driven by Mr. Mikko Pietilä, 29, from Ratinauksenkatu 78, Lapua. Mr. Pietilä was traveling southbound on Ratinauksenkatu approaching the intersection.

3. An additional eight vehicles were involved in a chain-reaction collision following the initial impact between the Corolla and Focus. These included a red Honda Civic, green Volkswagen Golf, black Audi A4, white Nissan Qashqai, grey BMW 3 Series, yellow Ford Fiesta, dark blue Opel Astra, and a cyclist using a bicycle without any specific registration.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **18:28 hours:** Light rain begins to fall in Lapua, reducing visibility and creating slippery road conditions on Kauppakatu and Ratinauksenkatu.

- **18:30 hours:** Ms. Sanna Koskinen's Toyota Corolla enters the intersection from the west, proceeding through a green light.

- **18:30 hours (approximate):** Mr. Mikko Pietilä's Ford Focus, approaching from the south on Ratinauksenkatu, fails to fully stop at the stop sign due to the wet road conditions. The vehicles collide at the intersection.

- **18:30-18:32 hours:** The initial impact between the Corolla and Focus triggers a chain reaction involving the subsequent eight vehicles, including the cyclist who was traveling through the intersection on Ratinauksenkatu.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The prevailing weather at the time of the incident was light rain, which reduced visibility and created slick road surfaces. The combination of these factors is believed to have contributed to Mr. Pietilä's inability to bring his vehicle to a complete stop, leading to the subsequent collisions.

**Vehicle Damage and Injuries:**

1. Toyota Corolla (FIN-123XY): Front-end damage, airbags deployed. Driver, Ms. Koskinen, sustained minor injuries.

2. Ford Focus (FIN-456ZY): Rear-end damage, passenger-side door dented. Driver, Mr. Pietilä, reported minor whiplash.

9. Opel Astra: Side mirror damaged, driver reported feeling shaken but uninjured.

10. Cyclist: Bicycle frame bent, minor bruising to the cyclist's leg from impact with a vehicle.

**Conclusion:**

The collision was primarily caused by Mr. Pietilä's failure to come to a full stop at the stop sign due to adverse weather conditions. The chain reaction involved the remaining vehicles as they attempted to avoid the initial collision. All parties involved were accounted for, and emergency medical services transported those with injuries to the nearest hospital for treatment. No fatalities were reported.
