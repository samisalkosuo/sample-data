**Narrative:**

On the evening of 01.09.2023, at approximately 18:20 hrs, a two-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ratinkatu in Hämeenkyrö, Finland. The incident involved a grey 2018 Volvo V60, registered with the license plate 345-VLO-HK, driven by Mr. Mikko Koskinen, 39, of Kauppakatu 12, Hämeenkyrö, and a silver 2020 Toyota Corolla, registered with the license plate 789-TOY-HK, operated by Ms. Anna Pietilä, 25, of Ratinkatu 45, Hämeenkyrö.

Witnesses at the scene, including Mr. Jussi Haapala and Ms. Laura Kivinen, reported that both vehicles were proceeding through the intersection with caution, given the overcast weather conditions which reduced visibility. The Volvo V60, traveling north on Kauppakatu, entered the intersection first, intending to turn left onto Ratinkatu. Simultaneously, the Toyota Corolla, heading east on Ratinkatu, approached the intersection with a green light in its favor.

As Mr. Koskinen initiated his left turn, Ms. Pietilä, who was maintaining a safe speed but possibly affected by the dim lighting, collided with the passenger side of the Volvo. The impact caused significant damage to both vehicles; the Volvo sustained considerable side panel and door damage, while the Corolla's front end was crumpled. Fortunately, neither driver nor passenger reported any injuries, though both were transported to Hämeenlinna Central Hospital as a precautionary measure.

**Timeline of Events:**

- 18:15 hrs: Both vehicles depart from their respective origins and approach the intersection.
- 18:18 hrs: Volvo V60 enters Kauppakatu, signaling a left turn intention.
- 18:20 hrs: Collision occurs as described above.
- 18:25 hrs: Emergency services dispatched and arrive at the scene.
- 18:45 hrs: Vehicles towed away; preliminary investigations commence.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The prevailing weather condition during the incident was overcast, with reduced visibility due to diffuse lighting. Although no precipitation was reported, the cloud cover contributed to challenging driving conditions, potentially affecting driver perception and reaction times. The road surface was dry but showed signs of wear from previous rainfall, which might have played a minor role in tire grip during the collision.

**Damage Descriptions:**

- Volvo V60: Extensive damage to the passenger side, including dented panels, shattered window glass, and misaligned door.
- Toyota Corolla: Frontal damage encompassing the bumper, hood, and headlight assembly.

**Conclusion:**

The investigation is ongoing to determine liability fully. Preliminary findings suggest that while both drivers adhered to traffic regulations, the overcast conditions may have impaired visibility, contributing to the collision. Further analysis of vehicle data recorders (black boxes) and witness testimonies will be crucial in forming a comprehensive understanding of the incident's circumstances.
