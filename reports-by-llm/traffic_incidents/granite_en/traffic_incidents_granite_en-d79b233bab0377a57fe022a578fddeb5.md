**Narrative:**

On the afternoon of 07.11.2024, at approximately 14:35 hours, a three-vehicle traffic incident occurred at the intersection of Pohjoiskarinkaukka and Keskusvuorinauka in Joensuu, Finland. The weather conditions were foggy, with reduced visibility affecting driver perception.

The vehicles involved were operated by the following individuals:
- **Driver A:** Jari Koskinen, a 38-year-old local resident of Pohjoiskarinkaukka, driving a blue 2019 Volvo V60 with license plate 123-ABC registered in Joensuu.
- **Driver B:** Anna Pitkänen, a 25-year-old student from Keskusvuorinauka, operating a red 2020 Ford Focus ST with license plate 456-DEF registered in Joensuu.
- **Driver C:** Olli Mäkelä, a 52-year-old delivery driver residing on Keskusvuorinauka, driving a white 2017 Toyota Corolla with license plate 789-GHI registered in Joensuu.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **14:30 hours:** Fog began to descend over the area, reducing visibility significantly.
- **14:32 hours:** Driver A, Jari Koskinen, was proceeding northbound on Pohjoiskarinkaukka approaching the intersection with Keskusvuorinauka.
- **14:33 hours:** Driver B, Anna Pitkänen, traveling eastbound on Keskusvuorinauka, entered the intersection intending to turn left onto Pohjoiskarinkaukka.
- **14:34 hours:** Driver C, Olli Mäkelä, was southbound on Pohjoiskarinkaukka, approaching the same intersection.
- **14:35 hours:** The fog's reduced visibility led to a misjudgment of distances and speeds by all drivers involved. Driver A continued straight through the intersection, while Driver B initiated her left turn directly in front of Driver C’s path. Driver C, unable to stop in time due to the slippery road conditions exacerbated by the fog, collided with Driver B's vehicle. The impact pushed Driver B's car into Driver A's path, resulting in a chain reaction collision.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The prevailing weather condition at the time of the incident was dense fog, which severely limited visibility to approximately 50 meters. The road surface was damp due to intermittent light rain, compounding the risk of reduced traction. These conditions contributed significantly to the drivers' inability to react appropriately and avoid the collision.

**Vehicle Damage:**

- **Volvo V60 (Driver A):** Sustained damage primarily to the front passenger side, including a dented fender and scratches along the door. The airbags deployed during the initial impact.
- **Ford Focus ST (Driver B):** Experienced substantial damage on the driver's side, with a crumpled front end, broken headlight, and a damaged rear passenger door from the subsequent collision with the Volvo.
- **Toyota Corolla (Driver C):** The front of the vehicle was severely impacted, with a collapsed hood, bent bumper, and fluid leaks noted post-incident.

**Witnesses:**

Two passersby, Sari Pietilä and Jussi Rantala, witnessed the incident and provided statements corroborating the sequence of events. They reported that all drivers appeared confused immediately following the collision, attributing this to the adverse weather conditions.

**Action Taken:**

Emergency services were promptly dispatched, arriving on-scene within eight minutes. All parties involved were assessed for injuries; fortunately, none sustained serious harm beyond minor cuts and shock. The vehicles were towed to a secure yard for further investigation and evidence collection.

This report is submitted for review and further action in accordance with standard protocol following a multi-vehicle traffic incident under challenging weather conditions. Further analysis, including potential charges and insurance claims, will follow once all evidence has been meticulously examined.
