On the evening of 05.02.2024, at approximately 18:25 hrs, a three-vehicle traffic incident occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Mestijärveniemetsäkatu in Ruovesi, Finland. The drivers involved were identified as Mr. Mikko Koskinen, Ms. Sanna Pitkänen, and Mr. Jussi Rantala.

Mr. Koskinen, driving a 2018 Volvo V60 with license plate 34-VLO-12, was proceeding northbound on Kauppakatu approaching the intersection. Ms. Pitkänen, operating a 2020 Toyota Corolla bearing the license plate 23-TOY-98, was traveling eastbound along Mestijärveniemetsäkatu. Mr. Rantala, at the helm of a 2016 Ford Focus with registration number 78-FOR-56, was heading south on Kauppakatu.

As per witness statements from passersby, Ms. Pitkänen proceeded through the intersection without yielding to Mr. Koskinen's right of way, colliding with his Volvo. The impact caused significant damage to both vehicles, with the front end of the Volvo sustaining heavy structural deformation and the Corolla's passenger side suffering a crumpled door and fender. Ms. Pitkänen was transported to Ruovesi Central Hospital for minor injuries, while Mr. Koskinen remained unharmed.

Following the initial collision, Mr. Rantala, unable to avoid the incident due to the obstruction caused by the Koskinen-Pitkänen crash, collided with Ms. Pitkänen's Corolla.
