**Timeline of Events:**

- At approximately 17:42 hours, Ms. Sanna Rautio initiated her left turn from Ruohoniekuskatu onto Kauppakatu in front of oncoming traffic, including Mr. Koskinen and Mr. Lappalainen.

- Due to the wet and slippery road conditions, Ms. Rautio's vehicle lost traction, sliding into the path of Mr. Koskinen’s Corolla.

- Mr. Koskinen attempted to brake but skidded on the slick pavement, colliding with Ms. Rautio's Honda Civic. The impact propelled Ms. Rautio's vehicle into a chain reaction, striking Mr. Lappalainen’s Focus.

- Simultaneously, Ms. Haapala, intending to turn right, was unable to navigate the slippery conditions and collided with Mr. Mäkelä’s Nissan Qashqai as she proceeded straight through the intersection.

- The force of this secondary collision sent Mr. Mäkelä's vehicle into the path of Mr. Kivinen’s Audi, which was unable to stop in time due to the wet roads.

- Ms. Mäkelä’s BMW then struck Mr. Lappalainen’s Focus from behind, pushing it further into the collision zone involving Ms. Rautio's Civic and Mr. Koskinen's Corolla.

- Finally, Ms. Mäkelä's vehicle was pushed into the rear of Ms. Haapala’s Civic by the force of the impact, completing the chain reaction.

- Ms. Eeva Mäkelä, driving the Dacia Sandero, managed to avoid the primary collision zone by swerving onto the sidewalk but was unable to prevent her vehicle from sustaining minor damage from debris.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The prevailing weather conditions at the time of the incident were wet with slippery road surfaces, contributing significantly to the severity of the collisions. Visibility was moderate, though reduced by light rainfall, which likely impaired drivers' ability to react effectively to the unfolding events.

**Vehicle Damage Descriptions:**

2. Honda Civic (HO-2345): Heavy front-end damage, with the left side severely crumpled from the Corolla's impact.

3. Ford Focus (FO-9101): Rear-end damage, with the trunk lid and rear bumper significantly dented from collisions with both the Civic and BMW.

4. Nissan Qashqai (NI-6789): Front-right side damage, including a bent passenger door and fender from impact with the BMW.

5. BMW 3 Series (BM-0123): Rear-end damage, with the trunk lid and rear bumper dented from collisions with the Qashqai and subsequent vehicles.

6. Audi A3 (AU-4567): Front-left side damage, with the passenger door and fender impacted during the collision sequence.

7. Dacia Sandero (DA-8901): Minor rear-end scuffing from debris impact while avoiding the main collision zone.

**Injuries:**

**Investigation Status:**

The scene was secured, and all vehicles were removed by 19:30 hours.
