*Reporting Officer:* Inspector Jouko Hietala, Luumäki Police Department  

**Narrative:**

On the morning of 08.12.2024, at approximately 09:15 hours, a two-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ruotsalanpuro in Luumäki, Finland. The drivers involved were identified as Mikael Andersson, 38, residing at Valtionpuistikko 12, and Elina Pitkäranta, 45, residing at Kauppiakademiankatu 30.

Andersson was driving a silver 2019 Toyota Corolla, bearing the Finnish license plate 87-AAS-12, traveling southbound on Kauppakatu. Pitkäranta was operating a blue 2020 Volvo XC60, identified by the license plate number 34-VLL-15, proceeding westbound on Ruotsalanpuro, intending to turn left onto Kauppakatu.

Witnesses, including passerby Anna-Liisa Koskinen and local shopkeeper Pekka Mäkelä, reported that the Volvo, driven by Pitkäranta, began its left turn without yielding to oncoming traffic. The Corolla, driven by Andersson, was unable to stop in time, resulting in a collision.

**Timeline of Events:**

- 09:14 hours: Elina Pitkäranta initiates her left turn from Ruotsalanpuro onto Kauppakatu.
- 09:15 hours: Mikael Andersson's Corolla, traveling south on Kauppakatu, collides with the driver’s side of Pitkäranta's Volvo as she begins her turn.
- 09:16 hours: Both vehicles come to a stop, partially blocking the intersection.
- 09:20 hours: First responders from the Luumäki Emergency Services arrive at the scene and begin assessing the situation.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The morning of the incident was characterized by overcast skies with light drizzle, reducing visibility slightly. While roads were not slick due to precipitation, the damp conditions may have contributed to reduced tire grip, potentially affecting braking distances.

**Vehicle Damage:**

The Corolla sustained significant damage to its passenger side, including a crumpled front fender and door, as well as minor scuffing on the driver's side. The Volvo incurred damage to its rear driver’s-side quarter panel and trunk, with visible dents and paint transfer from the Corolla.

**Conclusion:**

The investigation concluded that Elina Pitkäranta failed to yield the right of way while making a left turn, directly causing the collision with Mikael Andersson's vehicle. No other contributing factors were identified, such as mechanical failure or adverse weather conditions beyond the damp roads already noted. Pitkäranta was cited for violation of Finnish Road Traffic Act Section 67 (Failure to Yield). 

This report is submitted for further review and potential insurance claims processing. Further inquiries should be directed to Inspector Jouko Hietala at the Luumäki Police Department.
