On the afternoon of 28th December 2022, at approximately 14:30 hours, a three-vehicle traffic incident occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ruotsalanpuro in Juva, Finland. The weather conditions were foggy, with reduced visibility affecting driver perception.

The vehicles involved were operated by the following individuals:

3. **Driver C:** Olli Mäkelä, 55 years old, residing at Kauppakatu 45, Juva. He was operating a red 2019 Ford Focus with the license plate 654-JU-89.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **14:28 hours:** Driver A, Mikael Kivinen, approached the intersection from the north on Kauppakatu intending to turn left onto Ruotsalanpuro. Due to foggy conditions, visibility was significantly reduced.

- **14:29 hours:** Driver B, Anna Pitkänen, traveling southbound on Ruotsalanpuro, proceeded towards the intersection. She reported seeing the Volvo but misjudged its speed due to the poor visibility.

- **14:30 hours:** The critical moment occurred when Driver C, Olli Mäkelä, approaching from the east on a perpendicular street, Ruotsalanmäki, failed to notice the approaching vehicles because of the dense fog. His Ford Focus collided with the rear passenger side of Driver B's Toyota Corolla as it entered the intersection.

- **14:30-14:32 hours:** The impact from Driver C’s vehicle caused a chain reaction. The force of the collision propelled Driver B's car into the path of Driver A's Volvo, which was making its left turn. This resulted in a frontal collision between the two vehicles.

**Impact and Damage:**

- **Volvo V60 (Driver A):** Sustained significant damage to the front passenger side, including a crumpled hood and a damaged headlight. Airbags deployed, indicating occupant restraint.

- **Toyota Corolla (Driver B):** Experienced substantial damage on the rear passenger side, with a bent door and dented quarter panel. The vehicle was pushed into the intersection where it came to rest against the curb.

- **Ford Focus (Driver C):** The front driver's side of the car was severely damaged, with a collapsed front end and airbag deployment. It came to a stop partially blocking Ruotsalanpuro after the collision.

**Witnesses:**

Two pedestrians, Liisa Koskinen and Jussi Rantala, witnessed the incident from a nearby café on Kauppakatu. They reported that all drivers remained in their vehicles post-collision and appeared shaken but uninjured. Emergency services were promptly alerted, and all parties were checked for injuries, with no serious harm reported.

**Road Conditions:**

The foggy weather played a crucial role in the incident, impairing visibility and contributing to misjudgments regarding vehicle speeds and distances. Road markings and signs were obscured, likely affecting drivers' ability to navigate safely through the intersection.

**Conclusion:**

This report details a multi-vehicle collision resulting from adverse weather conditions in Juva, Finland. All parties involved were accountable for their actions under the given circumstances, and no criminal negligence was identified. The incident underscores the heightened risks associated with driving in foggy conditions and serves as a reminder of the importance of vigilance and reduced speeds during such weather events.
