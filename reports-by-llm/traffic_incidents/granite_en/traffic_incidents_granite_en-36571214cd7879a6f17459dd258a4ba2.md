**Traffic Incident Report**

*Incident Number:* 2024-Ran-012

*Date of Incident:* 06.12.2024

*Location:* Intersection of Kauppakatu and Metsäntie, Rantasalmi, Finland

*Reporting Officer:* Inspector Jouko Hietala, Rantasalmi Police Department

**Narrative:**

On the morning of 06.12.2024, at approximately 08:30, a two-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Metsäntie in Rantasalmi, Finland. The drivers involved were Mr. Mikko Koskinen, a local baker residing at 22 Kauppakatu, and Ms. Anna Pitkänen, a school teacher from 15 Metsäntie.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **08:25:** Mr. Koskinen, driving his 2018 Volvo V60 with license plate 345-VI registered in Rantasalmi, proceeded northbound on Kauppakatu approaching the intersection. Ms. Pitkänen, operating her 2019 Toyota Corolla bearing license plate 789-RA from her residence on Metsäntie, entered the intersection intending to turn left onto Kauppakatu.

- **08:28:** As Mr. Koskinen's vehicle neared the intersection, visibility was significantly reduced due to dense fog rolling in from the nearby lake. The fog conditions persisted throughout the area, impairing both drivers' ability to discern each other's approach clearly.

- **08:30:** Ms. Pitkänen initiated her left turn without fully clearing oncoming traffic, misjudging the distance and speed of Mr. Koskinen’s vehicle. The front passenger side of Mr. Koskinen's Volvo collided with the driver's side front of Ms. Pitkänen's Corolla.

- **08:31:** Both drivers brought their vehicles to a stop, and no immediate injuries were reported. Witnesses, including Ms. Laura Rantanen who was walking her dog nearby on Kauppakatu, confirmed the sequence of events.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The prevailing weather condition at the time of the incident was foggy, with reduced visibility to approximately 50 meters. The roads were dry but slippery due to residual morning dew, contributing to the drivers' difficulty in maintaining control under adverse conditions.

**Vehicle Damages:**

Mr. Koskinen's Volvo V60 sustained damage to its front passenger side, including a dented fender and scratches along the door. Ms. Pitkänen’s Corolla incurred damage to its driver's side front, with a crumpled hood and paint transfer from the Volvo.

**Conclusion:**

The collision was primarily attributed to the impaired visibility caused by fog and misjudgment on Ms. Pitkänen's part during her left turn. Both drivers were cited for failing to yield right-of-way and for driving in hazardous conditions without due caution. No serious injuries resulted, thanks to the relatively low speeds at impact.
