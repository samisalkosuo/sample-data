*Incident Number:* 2024-KA-0123  
*Date of Incident:* 18th November 2024  
*Location:* Intersection of Kauppakatu and Pohjois-Kaarina, Kaarina, Finland  
*Reporting Officer:* Inspector Jari Hietala

**Narrative:**

On the evening of 18th November 2024, at approximately 17:45 hours, a two-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Pohjois-Kaarina in the municipality of Kaarina, Finland. The incident involved a grey 2018 Toyota Corolla, registered with the license plate '345-KA-67', driven by Mr. Mikko Koskinen, a 32-year-old resident of Kauppakatu 12, and a silver 2020 Ford Focus, identified by its license plate '890-PO-12', operated by Ms. Anna Pietilä, a 27-year-old inhabitant of Pohjois-Kaarina 3B.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **17:40 hours:** Ms. Pietilä was driving southbound on Kauppakatu towards the intersection with Pohjois-Kaarina, adhering to the speed limit of 50 km/h due to wet and slippery road conditions caused by recent rainfall.

- **17:42 hours:** Mr. Koskinen, approaching from the east on Pohjois-Kaarina, intending to turn left onto Kauppakatu, failed to yield to oncoming traffic. His vehicle's right-turn indicator was activated but insufficiently in advance, contributing to Ms. Pietilä's lack of anticipation.

- **17:43 hours:** Upon realizing the impending collision, Ms. Pietilä applied her brakes firmly but encountered reduced traction due to the wet and slippery road surface. The Ford Focus skidded, colliding with the passenger side of Mr. Koskinen's Toyota Corolla.

- **17:44 hours:** Both vehicles came to a stop after the impact, partially blocking the intersection. Immediately following the collision, several pedestrian witnesses, including Ms. Laura Rantala and Mr. Jussi Lehtinen, who were walking their dog nearby, rushed to assist.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The prevailing weather conditions at the time of the incident were described as wet with slippery road surfaces, likely due to a recent downpour. These conditions significantly impacted vehicle control and braking distances, contributing factors in the severity of the collision.

**Vehicle Damage:**

- The Toyota Corolla sustained damage primarily to its passenger side, including a dented door, a broken side mirror, and scratches along the paneling.

- The Ford Focus incurred damage to its front passenger side, evidenced by a crumpled fender, a shattered headlight, and scrapes on the bumper.

**Witness Statements:**

Ms. Laura Rantala and Mr. Jussi Lehtinen corroborated Ms. Pietilä's account of events, noting that Mr. Koskinen's vehicle did not yield as indicated by its turn signal. They also confirmed the slippery road conditions, stating they had nearly lost their footing while walking.

**Conclusion:**

The collision was primarily caused by Mr. Koskinen's failure to yield right of way, compounded by adverse weather conditions that reduced vehicle control and braking effectiveness. No serious injuries were reported, though both drivers sought medical evaluation as a precaution. Charges for failing to yield are being considered against Mr. Koskinen.
