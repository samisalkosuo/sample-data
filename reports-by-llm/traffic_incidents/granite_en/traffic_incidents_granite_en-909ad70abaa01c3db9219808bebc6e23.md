*Date of Incident:* 18 February 2025

**Narrative:**

On the afternoon of 18 February 2025, at approximately 14:30 hours, a multi-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ruotsalanpuro in the municipality of Oulainen, Finland. The incident involved seven vehicles, resulting in various degrees of damage and minor injuries to the drivers and passengers.

The primary cause of the accident appears to be reduced visibility due to dense fog that enveloped the area during the daytime hours. At the time, the weather conditions were classified as 'Foggy' by the Meteorological Service of Finland, with visibility reportedly less than 100 meters.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **14:25 hours:** A fog advisory was issued for Oulainen and surrounding areas due to unusually thick fog rolling in from the nearby lake.

- **14:30 hours:** Seven vehicles approached the intersection from Kauppakatu, heading north, and Ruotsalanpuro, heading east. The drivers, identified as:
  - Mikko Koskinen (Vehicle: Volvo V60, License Plate 123-AB-45)
  - Anna Pitkänen (Vehicle: Ford Focus, License Plate 678-XY-90)
  - Jussi Rantala (Vehicle: Toyota Corolla, License Plate 345-LM-67)
  - Sanna Lehtinen (Vehicle: Nissan Qashqai, License Plate 987-UV-23)
  - Olli Mäkelä (Vehicle: Hyundai i30, License Plate 567-WZ-12)
  - Marko Hietala (Vehicle: BMW 3 Series, License Plate 234-JK-89)
  - and a local delivery driver, Jouko Kivinen (Vehicle: Mercedes Sprinter, License Plate 888-OP-56), were navigating through the reduced visibility.

- **14:32 hours:** As Mikko Koskinen proceeded through the intersection, he failed to notice Anna Pitkänen's vehicle entering from Ruotsalanpuro due to the fog. This initial collision triggered a chain reaction.

- **14:33 hours:** Jussi Rantala, following closely behind Koskinen, attempted to brake but collided with the rear of Koskinen's Volvo. Simultaneously, Sanna Lehtinen, traveling on Ruotsalanpuro, was unable to stop in time and struck Anna Pitkänen’s Ford Focus from the side.

- **14:34 hours:** The impact of these collisions caused Olli Mäkelä, driving a Hyundai i30, to swerve into Marko Hietala's BMW 3 Series, while Jouko Kivinen, in his Mercedes Sprinter, attempted to avoid the escalating situation but clipped the rear of Lehtinen’s Nissan Qashqai.

**Vehicle Damage and Injuries:**

- Mikko Koskinen's Volvo V60 sustained significant frontal damage, with the airbags deploying upon impact. Koskinen reported minor whiplash injuries.
  
- Anna Pitkänen’s Ford Focus suffered side panel damage and a bent door. Pitkänen experienced mild bruising from the seatbelt restraint.

- Jussi Rantala's Toyota Corolla had rear-end damage, with the trunk lid dented upon impact. Rantala reported no injuries but was shaken.

- Sanna Lehtinen’s Nissan Qashqai bore side impact marks and a scraped passenger-side door. Lehtinen sustained minor cuts from broken glass.

- Olli Mäkelä's Hyundai i30 showed frontal damage, with the bumper detached. Mäkelä reported whiplash similar to Koskinen.

- Marko Hietala’s BMW 3 Series had front-end damage, including a crumpled hood and headlight. Hietala was uninjured but in shock.

- Jouko Kivinen's Mercedes Sprinter had minor rear bumper damage. Kivinen reported no injuries but was visibly distressed.

**Witness Statements:**

Several pedestrians near the scene provided consistent accounts of the fog’s impact on visibility, corroborating driver statements. A local resident, Mr. Petteri Virtanen, reported seeing the initial collision between Koskinen and Pitkänen but noted that neither party seemed to apply emergency brakes in time due to the poor conditions.

**Conclusion:**

The incident was primarily caused by adverse weather conditions—thick fog reducing visibility significantly. All drivers involved were advised, and no criminal negligence was detected. The Finnish Transport Safety Agency has been notified for further investigation into potential improvements to road signage and lighting in similarly vulnerable intersections under foggy conditions.
