**Traffic Incident Report**

*Incident Number:* 2024-RAA-0825  
*Date of Incident:* 25th August 2024  
*Location:* Intersection of Kauppiaselkä and Rantapellonkatu, Raahe, Finland  
*Reporting Officer:* Inspector Jouko Hietala, Raahe Police Department  

**Narrative:**

On the evening of 25th August 2024, at approximately 21:30 hours, a three-vehicle traffic incident occurred at the intersection of Kauppiaselkä and Rantapellonkatu in Raahe, Finland. The primary contributing factors were light rain, which reduced visibility, and potential driver error.

The vehicles involved were a 2018 silver Toyota Corolla driven by Ms. Aino Miettinen, residing at Kauppiaselkä 45, Raahe; a 2020 blue Volvo XC60 operated by Mr. Jussi Koskinen, from Rantapellonkatu 12, Raahe; and a 2016 white Ford Focus driven by Ms. Sanna Lehtinen, living at Kauppiaselkä 99, Raahe.

According to witness statements and on-scene evidence, Ms. Miettinen was proceeding northbound on Kauppiaselkä towards the intersection intending to turn left onto Rantapellonkatu. Simultaneously, Mr. Koskinen was traveling southbound on Kauppiaselkä and approaching the same intersection, also preparing to turn left onto his residential street. Ms. Lehtinen was heading eastbound on Rantapellonkatu and approaching the intersection with a green light.

As Ms. Miettinen initiated her left turn, she may have misjudged the speed and proximity of Mr. Koskinen's vehicle due to the adverse weather conditions. Her Corolla was struck on the passenger side by Mr. Koskinen’s Volvo, which then collided with Ms. Lehtinen's Ford Focus, causing it to spin and come to a stop facing westbound on Rantapellonkatu.

**Timeline of Events:**

- 21:28 hours: Light rain begins in Raahe, reducing visibility.
- 21:29 hours: All three drivers prepare for their respective left turns at the approaching intersection.
- 21:30 hours: Ms. Miettinen and Mr. Koskinen simultaneously initiate their left turns.
- 21:31 hours: The collision occurs as described, with Ms. Miettinen's vehicle being struck first by Mr. Koskinen’s Volvo.
- 21:31-21:32 hours: Ms. Lehtinen's Ford Focus is subsequently impacted, resulting in its rotation.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The prevailing weather condition at the time of the incident was light rain, which reduced visibility and likely contributed to driver misjudgment regarding speed and distance. The roads were wet but not slippery, as per the Finnish Meteorological Institute's report for Raahe on that date.

**Vehicle Damage:**

- Ms. Miettinen’s Toyota Corolla (Finland license plate 123-AIO): Passenger side suffered significant damage, including a dented door and a broken side mirror. Airbag deployed.
- Mr. Koskinen’s Volvo XC60 (Finland license plate 456-JUS): Front passenger side sustained scratches and a minor dent. No airbag deployment.
- Ms. Lehtinen’s Ford Focus (Finland license plate 789-SAN): The vehicle rotated approximately 180 degrees, resulting in damage to the driver's side door, front bumper, and headlight. Airbag deployed.

**Witness Statements:**

Several passersby provided consistent accounts of the events leading up to and during the collision. Notably, Mr. Olli Pitkäranta, who was walking his dog nearby, reported seeing all three vehicles approaching the intersection and noted that Ms. Miettinen's turn appeared to begin slightly before it was safe, given Mr. Koskinen’s approach speed.

**Conclusion:**

The incident appears to have resulted from a misjudgment by Ms. Miettinen regarding the speed of oncoming traffic exacerbated by light rain conditions. All drivers are cooperating with the investigation, and no immediate signs of impairment were detected. Further analysis of vehicle data recorders (black boxes) has been requested to corroborate witness statements and provide additional insights into the sequence of events.
