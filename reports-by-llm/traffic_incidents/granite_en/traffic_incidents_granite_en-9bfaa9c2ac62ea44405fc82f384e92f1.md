**Narrative:**

On the evening of 14 February 2024, at approximately 18:30 hours, a multi-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ruotsalanpuro in the municipality of Laitila, Finland. Six vehicles were involved in the incident, resulting in various degrees of damage and minor injuries to the occupants.

The primary vehicles involved were:

3. A red 2016 Volkswagen Golf, registered as FIN-456ZX, driven by Ms. Kaisa Lehtinen, a nurse from Kauppakatu 21, traveling westbound on Kauppakatu.
4. A white 2019 Honda Civic, registered as FIN-321OP, driven by Mr. Samuli Miettinen, a student from Ruotsalanpuro 5, heading southbound on Ruotsalanpuro.
5. A grey 2017 Nissan Qashqai, registered as FIN-789QR, driven by Ms. Laura Koskinen, an office worker from Kauppakatu 16, traveling westbound on Kauppakatu.
6. A black 2015 BMW 3 Series, registered as FIN-654NL, driven by Mr. Teppo Virtanen, a retired engineer residing at Ruotsalanpuro 3, proceeding southbound on Ruotsalanpuro.

**Timeline of Events:**

- At approximately 18:28 hours, Ms. Pitkärant in the Toyota Corolla approached the intersection intending to turn left onto Ruotsalanpuro.
- Mr. Rantala in the Ford Focus was proceeding through the intersection with a green light, heading southbound on Ruotsalanpuro.
- Ms. Lehtinen in the Volkswagen Golf was following closely behind Ms. Pitkärant, also intending to turn left onto Ruotsalanpuro.
- Mr. Miettinen in the Honda Civic was traveling southbound on Ruotsalanpuro and aimed to continue straight through the intersection.
- Ms. Koskinen in the Nissan Qashqai was behind Mr. Pitkärant, intending the same left turn onto Ruotsalanpuro.
- Mr. Virtanen in the BMW 3 Series was approaching the intersection from Ruotsalanpuro, intending to turn right onto Kauppakatu.

As Ms. Pitkärant initiated her left turn, she misjudged the speed and distance of the oncoming vehicles, colliding first with Mr. Rantala's Ford Focus. The impact caused a chain reaction, with Ms. Lehtinen's Volkswagen Golf striking the rear of the Toyota Corolla. Simultaneously, Mr. Miettinen's Honda Civic, unable to stop in time, collided with the front of the Nissan Qashqai driven by Ms. Koskinen. Lastly, Mr. Virtanen's BMW 3 Series, attempting to avoid the collision, swerved and struck a traffic pole on the northeast corner of the intersection, sustaining significant damage.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

At the time of the incident, light rain was falling, reducing visibility and contributing to slippery road conditions. The roads were wet but not icy, which likely affected vehicle braking distances and driver reaction times.
