*Incident Number:* 240315-VAS-001  
*Date of Incident:* 15th March 2024  
*Location:* Intersection of Kauppiaselkä and Ristimäenkangas, Vaasa, Finland  
*Reporting Officer:* Inspector Jouko Hietala, Vaasa Police Department  

**Narrative:**

On the afternoon of 15th March 2024, at approximately 14:30 hours, a multi-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppiaselkä and Ristimäenkangas in Vaasa. The incident involved five vehicles, resulting in minor injuries to the drivers and passengers.

The primary vehicles involved were:
1. A silver 2020 Toyota Corolla, registered KY-1234, driven by Mr. Mikko Koskinen, a local resident of Ristimäenkangas 23.
2. A blue 2018 Volvo V60, registered VO-5678, operated by Ms. Sanna Pitkänen, who was commuting from Kauppiaselkä to her workplace in central Vaasa.
3. A red 2019 Ford Focus, identified as FI-9101, driven by Mr. Jari Lehtinen, a delivery driver for a local bakery on Kauppiaselkä.
4. A white 2017 Honda Civic, marked with the license plate HO-2345, driven by Ms. Heli Mäkelä, en route to pick up her child from school in the nearby neighborhood of Linnunlaulu.
5. A grey 2021 Dacia Logan, registered DA-6789, operated by Mr. Teppo Kivinen, who was returning home after a shopping trip in Vaasa's city center.

**Timeline of Events:**

- At approximately 14:25 hours, thick fog descended upon the region, reducing visibility to less than 50 meters.
- At 14:28 hours, Mr. Koskinen, driving his Toyota Corolla on Ristimäenkangas heading towards Kauppiaselkä, approached the intersection intending to turn left onto Kauppiaselkä.
- Ms. Pitkänen in her Volvo V60 was traveling along Kauppiaselkä, proceeding towards the same intersection from the opposite direction.
- Mr. Lehtinen, driving his Ford Focus on Kauppiaselkä, was heading southbound towards Ristimäenkangas.
- Ms. Mäkelä in her Honda Civic was approaching from the west, intending to turn right onto Ristimäenkangas.
- Mr. Kivinen, driving his Dacia Logan, was traveling eastbound on Ristimäenkangas, heading towards the intersection.

As all vehicles entered the fog-obscured intersection simultaneously, communication and visibility were severely compromised. The initial point of impact occurred when Mr. Lehtinen's Ford Focus collided with Ms. Pitkänen's Volvo V60, pushing it into the path of Mr. Koskinen's Toyota Corolla. This chain reaction continued, with Ms. Mäkelä's Honda Civic striking the side of Mr. Kivinen's Dacia Logan as she attempted to turn right.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The prevailing weather condition at the time was dense fog, significantly impairing visibility. According to meteorological records, the area experienced reduced visibility due to a localized fog bank, which persisted throughout the duration of the incident. The road surface, though dry, was slick with dew and fine mist from the fog, contributing to reduced traction for the vehicles involved.

**Vehicle Damage:**

1. Toyota Corolla (KY-1234): Front-end damage, including a crumpled hood and damaged headlights.
2. Volvo V60 (VO-5678): Heavy frontal impact, with the passenger side door severely dented and the airbags deployed.
3. Ford Focus (FI-9101): Significant damage to the driver's side, including a bent frame and shattered windshield.
4. Honda Civic (HO-2345): Right side panel severely scraped, with the rear passenger door unable to open.
5. Dacia Logan (DA-6789): Minor denting on the driver's side door and hood, indicating a glancing blow from the Honda Civic.

**Injuries:**

All drivers and passengers sustained minor injuries, primarily from airbag deployment and whiplash. They were transported to Vaasa Central Hospital for evaluation and treatment. No life-threatening conditions were reported.

**Witnesses:**

Two pedestrians, Ms. Anna Rautio and Mr. Jussi Nurmi, who were walking their dogs in the vicinity, provided statements corroborating the sequence of events and the adverse weather conditions.

This report is submitted for further investigation and insurance claims processing. Further details may emerge as witness interviews progress and vehicle inspections are conducted.
