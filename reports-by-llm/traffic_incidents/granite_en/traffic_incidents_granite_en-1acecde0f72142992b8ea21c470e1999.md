**Narrative:**

On the afternoon of 20 May 2023, at approximately 14:15 hrs, a two-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ratinauksenkatu in Simo, Finland. The incident involved a white 2019 Toyota Corolla, registered under the name of Mikko Aalto, residing at Kauppiasentie 12, and a silver 2020 Ford Focus driven by local resident, Eeva Virtanen from Ratinauksenpuurola 34.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **14:10 hrs:** Mikko Aalto, driving his Toyota Corolla (license plate 123-TO-12) southbound on Kauppakatu, approached the intersection intending to turn left onto Ratinauksenkatu.
- **14:12 hrs:** Eeva Virtanen, operating her Ford Focus (license plate 456-FO-34), proceeded northbound on Kauppakatu, maintaining a lawful speed for the snowy conditions.
- **14:14 hrs:** As Aalto initiated his left turn, Virtanen, distracted momentarily by a pedestrian crossing nearby, failed to reduce her speed despite the slippery road surface caused by fresh snowfall.
- **14:15 hrs:** The vehicles collided at the intersection. The front passenger side of Aalto's Corolla struck the driver’s side of Virtanen's Focus, resulting in moderate damage to both vehicles.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

At the time of the incident, snow was falling intermittently, reducing visibility and creating a slippery road surface. The Finnish Meteorological Institute reported light snowfall with poor road traction, contributing factors in this collision.

**Vehicle Damage Description:**

- **Toyota Corolla (123-TO-12):** Significant damage to the front passenger side, including a crumpled fender and dented door. Airbag deployment noted.
- **Ford Focus (456-FO-34):** Driver's side door sustained a dent, and the headlight was shattered from the impact.

**Witnesses:**

Two passersby, Anna Kaski and Jussi Rantala, provided statements confirming they witnessed Virtanen’s distraction just prior to the collision. They also noted the slippery conditions on Kauppakatu.

**Medical Response:**

Eeva Virtanen was transported to Simo Central Hospital for minor injuries and checked for potential whiplash. Mikko Aalto declined medical attention at the scene but was advised to seek a follow-up due to airbag exposure.

**Preliminary Investigation Findings:**

The investigation suggests that driver distraction, combined with adverse weather conditions, played crucial roles in this collision. No evidence of mechanical failure or excessive speed was found. Both drivers were issued citations for failing to yield the right-of-way and driving without due care and attention, respectively.
