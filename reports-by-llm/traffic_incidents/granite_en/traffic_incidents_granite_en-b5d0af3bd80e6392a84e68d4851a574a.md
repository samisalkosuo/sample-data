**Narrative:**

On the night of 09.01.2025, at approximately 23:45, a two-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ratinkatu in Taivalkoski, Finland. The drivers involved were identified as Jari Korhonen, a 38-year-old local resident, operating a 2018 Volvo V60 with Finnish license plate 123-ABC, and Anna Pitkäranta, a 25-year-old student, driving a 2015 Toyota Corolla bearing the license plate 456-DEF.

Witnesses at the scene, notably a passerby named Marko Lehtinen, reported that Mr. Korhonen was traveling westbound on Kauppakatu approaching the intersection with Ratinkatu. Ms. Pitkäranta was proceeding southbound on Ratinkatu intending to turn left onto Kauppakatu. According to witness statements and preliminary evidence, Ms. Pitkäranta failed to yield the right of way to Mr. Korhonen, resulting in a collision.

**Timeline of Events:**

- 23:40 - Ms. Pitkäranta initiates her left turn from Ratinkatu onto Kauppakatu.
- 23:41 - Mr. Korhonen, driving within the speed limit and under clear night conditions, observes Ms. Pitkäranta's intent to turn but misjudges the distance and timing due to potential glare from oncoming headlights or momentary distraction.
- 23:42 - The vehicles collide in the intersection. Mr. Korhonen's Volvo sustains damage primarily to the front passenger side, while Ms. Pitkäranta’s Corolla suffers significant damage to the driver's side.
- 23:43 - Both drivers exit their vehicles and approach each other, exchanging basic information. Witness Marko Lehtinen stays to provide his account of the incident to the responding officers.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The night was clear with a full moon providing ample illumination, though some witnesses noted that the bright lunar light could have contributed to temporary glare affecting visibility. The roads were dry, and there were no adverse weather conditions reported that might have impaired driving or braking performance.

**Vehicle Damage:**

The Volvo V60 driven by Mr. Korhonen displayed substantial damage to its front passenger side, including a crumpled fender and a dented door. The airbags deployed during the impact, indicating a moderate collision force. 

Ms. Pitkäranta's Toyota Corolla showed severe damage on the driver’s side, with the front end collapsed and the passenger-side door misaligned. Evidence suggests that the point of impact was the driver's side corner of the Corolla.

**Conclusion:**

Preliminary investigation indicates that Ms. Pitkäranta failed to yield right of way, leading to the collision. Charges for traffic violation are being considered. Further analysis, including potential review of vehicle event data recorders (black boxes), will be conducted to corroborate witness statements and establish definitive cause.
