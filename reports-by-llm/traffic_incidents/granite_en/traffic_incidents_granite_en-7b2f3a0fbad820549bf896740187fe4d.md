**Narrative:**

On the afternoon of 11 January 2024, at approximately 14:30 hours, a multi-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ruotsalanpuro in Evijärvi, Finland. The incident involved six vehicles, resulting in various degrees of damage and minor injuries to the occupants.

The primary vehicles involved were:

3. A white 2018 Volkswagen Golf, registered LI-24680, driven by Ms. Laura Koskinen, a student at the University of Lapland, heading south on Kauppakatu.

4. A red 2017 Honda Civic, registered HA-35791, driven by Mr. Jussi Mäkelä, an IT specialist from Valtionpuro 32, turning left from Ruotsalanpuro onto Kauppakatu.

5. A black 2021 Nissan Qashqai, registered NO-98765, driven by Ms. Sanna Lehtinen, a nurse at the Evijärvi Hospital, travelling north on Kauppakatu.

6. A silver 2016 BMW 3 Series, registered BM-43210, driven by Mr. Teppo Virtanen, a retired engineer from Mäkelänkatu 12, proceeding straight through the intersection on Kauppakatu.

**Timeline of Events:**

- At 14:28 hours, Ms. Pietilä in the Toyota Corolla approached the stop sign on Kauppakatu at Ruotsalanpuro. Due to heavy rain reducing visibility, she failed to fully observe Mr. Rantanen's Ford Focus entering the intersection from her right.

- Simultaneously, Mr. Rantanen, while having a green light, was unable to perceive Ms. Pietilä’s vehicle due to the intense rainfall and its resulting glare on wet roads.

- The collision occurred when the front of Mr. Rantanen's Focus struck the passenger side of Ms. Pietilä's Corolla, pushing it into the path of Ms. Koskinen’s southbound Volkswagen Golf.

- The impact of this secondary collision caused Ms. Koskinen to lose control, her vehicle spinning and colliding with Mr. Mäkelä’s turning Honda Civic, which was making a left turn from Ruotsalanpuro onto Kauppakatu.

- Meanwhile, Ms. Lehtinen in the Nissan Qashqai, travelling north, was unable to stop in time and collided with the rear of Mr. Mäkelä's Civic.

- Lastly, Mr. Virtanen, driving the BMW 3 Series, attempted to avoid the cascading collisions by braking but skidded on the wet road surface, striking the curb and coming to a halt partially blocking the pedestrian crossing on Kauppakatu.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

Heavy rain was reported throughout Evijärvi from 14:00 to 15:00 hours, significantly impairing visibility and reducing road grip. The wet conditions exacerbated braking distances, contributing to the severity of the collisions.

**Vehicle Damages:**

- Toyota Corolla (KY-12345): Significant damage to the passenger side, airbag deployment, and minor injuries to Ms. Pietilä.

- Ford Focus (JO-67890): Front-end damage, airbag deployment, and minor injuries to Mr. Rantanen.

- Volkswagen Golf (LI-24680): Heavy frontal damage, airbag deployment, and minor injuries to Ms. Koskinen.

- Honda Civic (HA-35791): Left side damage, airbag deployment, and minor injuries to Mr. Mäkelä.

- Nissan Qashqai (NO-98765): Rear-end damage, no airbag deployment, but Ms. Lehtinen sustained whiplash.

- BMW 3 Series (BM-43210): Minor front curb damage, no airbag deployment, and Mr. Virtanen was unharmed.

**Witness Statements:**

Several pedestrians at a nearby bus stop corroborated the sequence of events, noting the heavy rain and reduced visibility. A passing delivery cyclist also provided an account consistent with the described scenario.
