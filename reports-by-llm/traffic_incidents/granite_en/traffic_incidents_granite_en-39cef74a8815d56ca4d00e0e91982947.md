**Traffic Incident Report**

*Incident Number:* 2025-ÄÄ-0309  
*Date of Incident:* 09th March 2025  
*Location:* Intersection of Kauppakatu and Metsäntie, Äänekoski, Finland  
*Reporting Officer:* Inspector Jouko Hietala, Äänekoski Police Department  

**Narrative:**

On the evening of 09th March 2025, at approximately 18:30 hours, a two-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Metsäntie in the municipality of Äänekoski, Finland. The incident involved a grey 2018 Volvo V60, registered with the license plate 92-ABC-DF, driven by Mr. Petteri Kivinen, a 34-year-old local resident, and a silver 2020 Toyota Corolla, identified by its license plate number 15-DEF-GH, operated by Ms. Anna-Liisa Rantala, a 29-year-old residing in the nearby village of Kangasalmi.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **18:20 hours:** Both vehicles were travelling towards the intersection from perpendicular streets. The Volvo V60 was proceeding along Metsäntie, while the Toyota Corolla was on Kauppakatu.
- **18:25 hours:** As Mr. Kivinen approached the stop sign on Metsäntie, Ms. Rantala entered the intersection from Kauppakatu without fully stopping, as indicated by skid marks detected later.
- **18:26 hours:** The collision occurred when the front passenger side of the Volvo V60 struck the driver's side of the Toyota Corolla. Both vehicles came to a halt on the intersection, partially blocking traffic flow.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The evening was marked by light rain, which contributed to slippery road conditions. The precipitation had reduced visibility slightly, and witnesses reported that the asphalt surface was damp but not covered in standing water. These conditions likely played a role in Ms. Rantala's failure to fully stop at the stop sign.

**Damage Description:**

The Volvo V60 sustained damage primarily to its front passenger side, including a dented fender and scratches along the door. The airbag had deployed, indicating impact. Ms. Rantala reported minor whiplash symptoms but was otherwise unharmed.

The Toyota Corolla incurred damage on its driver's side, with a crumpled front panel and a broken headlight. Ms. Rantala was checked by emergency medical services at the scene and deemed to have no life-threatening injuries.

**Witnesses:**

Two passersby, Mr. Jussi Pekkarinen and Ms. Laura Koskinen, witnessed the incident and provided statements corroborating the sequence of events. They noted that Ms. Rantala's vehicle entered the intersection without coming to a complete stop, which led to the collision with Mr. Kivinen’s vehicle.

**Conclusion:**

The investigation concluded that the primary cause of the collision was Ms. Rantala's failure to obey the stop sign, exacerbated by light rain conditions affecting road traction and visibility. No criminal charges were warranted; however, Ms. Rantala received a traffic violation for failing to yield at a stop sign. Both drivers were advised to exercise additional caution during inclement weather.
