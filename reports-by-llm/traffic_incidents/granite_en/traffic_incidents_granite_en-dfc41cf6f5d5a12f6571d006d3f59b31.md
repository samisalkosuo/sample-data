**Narrative:**

On the night of 08.12.2022, at approximately 23:45 hours, a two-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Yli-Kärsämäenravintola in Kärsämäki, Finland. The vehicles involved were a silver 2018 Toyota Corolla, registered with the license plate 34-AJK, driven by Mr. Mikko Hietala, 35, of Kauppakatu 12, and a grey 2020 Ford Focus, registered with the license plate 78-KMF, driven by Ms. Sanna Koskinen, 29, of Yli-Kärsämäenravintola 3.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **23:40 hours:** Ms. Koskinen was driving westbound on Yli-Kärsämäenravintola approaching the intersection with Kauppakatu. Mr. Hietala, traveling northbound on Kauppakatu, failed to yield the right of way at the stop sign, entering the intersection against a red light.

- **23:41 hours:** Upon observing Mr. Hietala's vehicle, Ms. Koskinen applied her brakes but was unable to prevent a collision due to the snowy road conditions. The front passenger side of the Ford Focus struck the driver's side of the Toyota Corolla.

- **23:42 hours:** Both vehicles came to a stop in the intersection, partially blocking traffic flow on both streets. Witnesses, including Ms. Leena Rantala and Mr. Jussi Pitkäranta, immediately exited their nearby residences to assist.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The roads were covered with a light layer of snow, reducing visibility and traction. The temperature was just above freezing at 2°C, with intermittent snowfall contributing to slippery conditions. Streetlights in the area were operational but their effectiveness was diminished by the weather.

**Vehicle Damage:**

The Toyota Corolla, driven by Mr. Hietala, sustained damage primarily to its driver's side front fender and hood, with visible scrapes and dents. The Ford Focus, driven by Ms. Koskinen, showed significant damage to its passenger side front, including a crumpled door and a damaged headlight.

**Injuries:**

Both drivers reported minor injuries consistent with seatbelt usage. They were transported to the Kuhmo Hospital for evaluation and subsequent release. No passengers were involved in this incident.

**Witness Statements:**

Ms. Leena Rantala, a neighbor residing at 10 Yli-Kärsämäenravintola, confirmed observing Ms. Koskinen's vehicle braking abruptly and the subsequent collision. Mr. Jussi Pitkäranta, the reporting officer’s brother living at 25 Kauppakatu, corroborated that he heard the screeching of tires and the impact but did not witness the event directly due to being indoors.

**Action Taken:**

The intersection was temporarily closed for investigation and clearance. Both vehicles were towed to a secure lot for storage, and the scene was documented with photographs and measurements. Mr. Hietala received a citation for failing to obey a stop sign. Further investigation is ongoing to determine if additional factors contributed to the collision, such as speed or potential mechanical issues exacerbated by weather conditions.
