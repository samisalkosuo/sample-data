**Narrative:**

On the morning of 22nd July 2024, at approximately 10:15 AM, a three-vehicle traffic incident occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Metsäntie in Äänekoski, Finland. The vehicles involved were driven by the following individuals:

1. **Driver A**: Marko Hietala, age 34, residing at Valtionpuistari 23, Äänekoski. He was driving a blue 2018 Volvo V60 with Finnish license plate 123-AB-45.
2. **Driver B**: Anna Pietilä, age 29, residing at Kauppiakademi 10, Äänekoski. She was operating a red 2020 Toyota Corolla with Finnish license plate 678-XY-90.
3. **Driver C**: Olli Rantala, age 52, residing at Metsänkulkintie 45, Äänekoski. He was in control of a grey 2015 Ford Focus with Finnish license plate 345-MN-67.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **10:10 AM**: Anna Pietilä, driving her Toyota Corolla on Metsäntie heading towards Kauppakatu, approached the intersection with a green light. Marko Hietala, in his Volvo V60 on Kauppakatu, proceeded through the intersection without yielding to Anna's right-of-way, colliding with her vehicle at the crossroads.

- **10:11 AM**: Olli Rantala, driving his Ford Focus on Metsäntie in the opposite direction, was forced to apply emergency brakes to avoid a collision with Anna Pietilä's Corolla, which had come to a stop after the initial impact. His vehicle skidded on the wet road surface due to heavy rainfall, eventually colliding with the rear of Marko Hietala's Volvo V60.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

Heavy rain was reported throughout the municipality of Äänekoski during the incident period, significantly reducing visibility and causing wet road surfaces. The combination of these conditions contributed to the drivers' inability to maintain control of their vehicles, leading to the described collisions.

**Vehicle Damages:**

- Marko Hietala's Volvo V60 sustained damage to the front passenger side, including a dented fender and a cracked headlight. The airbags deployed during the impact.
  
- Anna Pietilä's Toyota Corolla incurred substantial damage on the driver’s side, with a bent door, broken side mirror, and a flat tire from the collision.

- Olli Rantala's Ford Focus suffered rear-end damage, including a crumpled boot lid and a damaged taillight. No passengers were reported in any of the vehicles involved.

**Witness Statements:**

Two pedestrians, Liisa Koskinen and Jouko Lehtinen, witnessed the incident from adjacent properties on Kauppakatu and Metsäntie, respectively. They confirmed that all traffic signals were functioning correctly at the time of the accident and described the heavy rainfall as a contributing factor to the drivers' reduced reaction times.

**Action Taken:**

Emergency services were promptly dispatched to the scene. The injured parties—Marko Hietala and Anna Pietilä—were transported to Äänekoski Central Hospital for medical evaluation, with non-life-threatening injuries reported. The roads were cleared of debris, and temporary traffic diversions were established while the scene was processed for evidence.

This report is submitted for further investigation and insurance claims processing. Further inquiries should be directed to Officer Jari P. Korhonen at the Äänekoski Police Department.
