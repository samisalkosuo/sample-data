**Timeline of Events:**

- At approximately 18:30 hours, mixed snow and rain began to fall in Loviisa, reducing visibility and creating slippery road conditions on Kauppakatu and Ratinkatu.
  
- At 18:40 hours, Mr. Koskinen, driving his Volvo V60 southbound on Kauppakatu, approached the intersection intending to turn left onto Ratinkatu. Ms. Pietilä in her Ford Focus was travelling northbound on Kauppakatu and had a green light to proceed straight through the intersection.

- As Mr. Koskinen initiated his left turn, he misjudged the distance due to reduced visibility from the mixed precipitation. His vehicle collided with Ms. Pietilä's Ford Focus, causing significant frontal damage to both vehicles.

- Meanwhile, Mr. Lehtinen in his Toyota Corolla was proceeding eastbound on Ratinkatu and was struck by the Volvo V60 as it continued into the intersection after the initial collision. The Corolla sustained damage to its passenger side.

- Simultaneously, Ms. Rantanen in her Honda Civic was travelling westbound on Ratinkatu and was unable to stop due to the wet road conditions. She collided with the rear of Mr. Lehtinen's Corolla.

- Lastly, Mr. Mäkelä in his Nissan Qashqai was following Ms. Rantanen closely and was unable to avoid colliding with her Honda Civic, sustaining damage to the front end of both vehicles.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The roads were wet from a mixture of snow and rain, leading to reduced traction and visibility. The Finnish Meteorological Institute reported wind speeds of 15 km/h with intermittent light snowfall, contributing to the hazardous conditions.

**Damage Descriptions:**

- Volvo V60: Frontal damage, airbags deployed.
- Ford Focus: Frontal damage, airbags deployed.
- Toyota Corolla: Passenger side damage, airbags deployed.
- Honda Civic: Rear end damage, airbags deployed.

**Investigation Status:**

The investigation is ongoing, with road condition analysis and vehicle black box data retrieval underway to determine contributing factors beyond driver error. All drivers have been cited for negligent driving due to the weather conditions.
