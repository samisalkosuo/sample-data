**Narrative:**

On the evening of 03.03.2025, at approximately 18:15 hours, a three-vehicle traffic incident occurred at the intersection of Oulu Street and Helsinki Avenue in Tampere, Finland. The primary vehicles involved were a grey 2019 Toyota Corolla, registered as FIN-123A, driven by Mr. Mikko Hietala, 34, residing at Valtteri Street 12; a silver 2020 Ford Focus, identified as FIN-789B, operated by Ms. Sanna Koskinen, 27, from Kouvola Avenue 5; and a black 2018 Volkswagen Passat, marked with the license plate FIN-ABC1, driven by Mr. Jari Mäkelä, 45, living on Ristimäki Street 34.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **18:10 hours:** Ms. Sanna Koskinen, driving her Ford Focus southbound on Helsinki Avenue, approached the intersection with Oulu Street. Light rain was falling, reducing visibility and making the asphalt slick.

- **18:12 hours:** Mr. Mikko Hietala, in his Toyota Corolla, proceeded eastbound on Oulu Street towards Helsinki Avenue. He failed to fully stop at the stop sign due to the wet road conditions.

- **18:13 hours:** Mr. Jari Mäkelä, driving the Passat northbound on Helsinki Avenue, entered the intersection without noticing Ms. Koskinen's vehicle due to the light rain obscuring his view. The three vehicles collided in a T-shaped configuration, with the Ford Focus striking the front passenger side of the Passat and the Corolla colliding with the rear driver’s side of the Focus.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The prevailing weather at the time was light rain, which reduced visibility and created slippery road conditions. The combination of these factors contributed to the drivers' inability to react promptly to the changing traffic situation.

**Vehicle Damages:**

- The Ford Focus sustained significant damage to its front passenger side, including a crumpled fender and a dented door. Airbags deployed during the collision.

- The Volkswagen Passat showed impact marks on its rear driver’s side panel, a bent bumper, and scratches along the right quarter panel.

- The Toyota Corolla had damage to its rear passenger side, with a scraped bumper and minor paint transfer from the Focus.

**Witnesses:**

Two pedestrians, Ms. Anna Pitkäranta and Mr. Olli Rantala, witnessed the incident from nearby premises on Oulu Street and provided statements corroborating the sequence of events. They noted that all drivers appeared shaken but uninjured immediately post-collision.

**Action Taken:**

Emergency services were promptly dispatched to the scene. All involved parties were transported to Tampere Central Hospital for precautionary checks, with no serious injuries reported. The vehicles were towed away for further inspection and repairs. Traffic was rerouted temporarily to minimize congestion while the investigation proceeded.
