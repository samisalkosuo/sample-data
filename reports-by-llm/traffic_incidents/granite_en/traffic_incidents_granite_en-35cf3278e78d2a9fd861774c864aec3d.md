**Incident Summary:**

On the morning of 07 May 2025, at approximately 08:45, a two-vehicle collision occurred on Kauppakatu, a primary thoroughfare in the municipality of Iitti, Finland. The incident involved a white 2019 Toyota Corolla, registered with the license plate 34-AIF-12, driven by Mr. Mikko Koskinen, 38, from nearby Kuopio, and a silver 2020 Ford Focus, identified by its license plate number 56-BGF-90, operated by Ms. Anna Pitkänen, 27, a resident of Iitti.

**Narrative:**

At the time of the incident, Mr. Koskinen was traveling eastbound on Kauppakatu towards the town center for his regular morning commute to work at the local municipal office. Ms. Pitkänen, en route to her part-time job at a nearby café, was driving westbound on the same street. The icy road conditions, exacerbated by overnight freezing temperatures, contributed to reduced traction and visibility.

As Mr. Koskinen approached the intersection with Pohjoiskatu, he attempted to navigate a slight curve. Due to the icy roads, his vehicle began to skid, losing control momentarily. In an attempt to regain control, he overcorrected, causing the Corolla to drift into the westbound lane.

Ms. Pitkänen, maintaining a steady speed and adhering to traffic regulations, was unaware of the developing situation as her vehicle entered the Corolla's path. Despite her timely application of brakes, the slippery conditions prevented her from avoiding a collision. The front passenger side of the Ford Focus made contact with the driver’s side front of the Toyota Corolla.

**Witnesses:**

Two pedestrians, Mr. Jari Mäkelä and Ms. Laura Rantanen, who were walking their dogs along Kauppakatu, witnessed the incident. They immediately contacted emergency services at 08:47, reporting the collision and providing assistance to the involved parties until the arrival of emergency medical services (EMS).

**Timeline:**

- **08:35:** Overnight temperatures drop below freezing, causing icy road conditions on Kauppakatu.
- **08:40:** Mr. Koskinen and Ms. Pitkänen begin their respective journeys.
- **08:45:** Collision occurs as described above.
- **08:47:** Witnesses, Mr. Mäkelä and Ms. Rantanen, call emergency services.

**Vehicle Damage:**

The Toyota Corolla sustained significant damage to its front driver's side, including a crumpled fender and a dented door. The Ford Focus incurred damage to its front passenger side, with a bent hood and scratches along the side panel. Both vehicles were towed from the scene by a local wrecker service at 09:15 for further inspection and repairs.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The icy roads played a critical role in the incident, contributing to reduced vehicle control and reaction times. Visibility was moderately affected due to light morning fog, compounded by glare from sunlight reflecting off the icy surfaces.

**Conclusion:**

This report details a collision resulting from adverse weather conditions impacting driver control on Kauppakatu in Iitti, Finland. Both drivers were cited for failing to maintain control of their vehicles under hazardous road conditions. No further action is warranted at this time, and both parties have been advised to seek necessary repairs and consider the implications of winter driving practices.
