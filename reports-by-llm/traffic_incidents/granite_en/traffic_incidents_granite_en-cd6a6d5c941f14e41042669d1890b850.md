**Narrative:**

On the evening of 24th October 2024, at approximately 21:30 hours, a two-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ruotsalanpuro in Heinola, Finland. The incident involved a silver 2019 Toyota Corolla, driven by Mr. Petteri Hietanen, age 34, residing at Kauppakatu 56, and a blue 2020 Ford Focus, operated by Ms. Anna-Liisa Koskinen, age 28, from Ruotsalanpuro 12.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **21:28 hours:** Mr. Hietanen, driving northbound on Kauppakatu towards the intersection, approached the stop line. Ms. Koskinen, traveling eastbound on Ruotsalanpuro, prepared to turn left onto Kauppakatu.
- **21:29 hours:** Both drivers observed the approach of an oncoming vehicle and initiated braking procedures. The road conditions were dry but unusually cold for the time of year, contributing to reduced traction.
- **21:30 hours:** Mr. Hietanen's Toyota Corolla struck the passenger side of Ms. Koskinen's Ford Focus as she attempted her left turn. The impact caused both vehicles to come to a stop facing opposite directions in the intersection.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The night was clear with minimal visibility issues, but the temperature was notably lower than average for October, leading to reduced road surface friction. There were no precipitation or obscuring weather phenomena reported.

**Vehicle Details and Damage:**

- **Toyota Corolla (Finland's license plate 123-AB-45):** Sustained damage primarily to the passenger side, including a dented door and scratches along the side panel. The airbags deployed during the collision.
- **Ford Focus (Finland's license plate 678-CD-90):** Experienced significant damage to the front passenger quarter, with the headlight assembly shattered and the fender crumpled. Airbags in the passenger seat also deployed.

**Witnesses:**

Two pedestrians, Mr. Jari Pitkäranta and Ms. Sanna Lehtinen, witnessed the incident from a nearby café on Kauppakatu. They reported that both drivers appeared to adhere to traffic signals and provided consistent accounts of the events leading up to the collision.

**Investigation Findings:**

Preliminary investigation suggests no mechanical failures contributing to the accident. Both drivers were within legal speed limits for the area, and there was no evidence of impairment or distraction. The cold weather conditions likely played a role in reduced tire grip, complicating braking efforts.

This report is submitted for further analysis and potential insurance claims processing. Further investigation may include detailed forensic examination and interviews with the drivers involved.
