7. A green 2019 Dacia Sandero, registered DD-5678, driven by Ms. Kaisa Virtanen, 45, from Pohjoiskosenturintie 33, Uusikaarlepyy. She was attempting to navigate a right turn from Kauppakatu onto Ruotsalanpuro.

**Timeline of Events:**

- At 18:20 hrs, mixed snow and rain began falling in Uusikaarlepyy, reducing visibility and creating slippery road conditions.

- At 18:23 hrs, Ms. Lehtinen, in the Nissan Qashqai, signaled her intention to turn left from Ruotsalanpuro onto Kauppakatu but misjudged the speed and distance of oncoming traffic due to poor visibility.

- At 18:24 hrs, Ms. Pitkäranten in the Toyota Corolla, traveling northbound on Kauppakatu, collided with Ms. Lehtinen's Nissan Qashqai as she attempted her left turn. The impact caused the Nissan to spin, facing southbound.

- Simultaneously, Mr. Räty in the Volvo V60, approaching from Ruotsalanpuro, was unable to stop in time and collided with the rear of the Toyota Corolla.

- The force of this secondary collision propelled the Corolla into the path of several following vehicles, including the Honda Civic driven by Ms. Koskinen, the BMW 3 Series driven by Mr. Kivinen, and the Dacia Sandero driven by Ms. Virtanen, who was preparing for her right turn.

- The Dacia Sandero sustained significant frontal damage upon impact with the BMW, while the BMW itself collided with the rear of the Sandero, causing further damage and pushing it into the curb.

- Ms. Koskinen's Honda Civic, unable to stop in time, struck the rear of the BMW, resulting in considerable damage to both vehicles.
