**Timeline of Events:**

- **09:15 AM:** Heavy rainfall commences, reducing visibility and creating slippery road conditions on Kauppakatu and Pohjoiskarinkuja.
  
- **09:20 AM:** Mikko Kivinen, driving his Volvo V60 westbound on Kauppakatu, approaches the intersection with Pohjoiskarinkuja.

- **09:21 AM:** Sanna Pietilä, in her Ford Focus, travels southbound on Pohjoiskarinkuja towards the intersection.

- **09:22 AM:** Jari Hietala, operating his Ford Transit eastbound on Kauppakatu, enters the intersection without noticing the wet road conditions and fails to yield to oncoming traffic.

- **09:23 AM:** Collision occurs as Hietala's LCV strikes Kivinen's Volvo V60 at the passenger side. Simultaneously, Pietilä's Ford Focus, unable to stop in time due to heavy rain and poor visibility, collides with Kivinen’s vehicle on its driver's side.

- **09:24 AM:** The impact of Pietilä's vehicle pushes Kivinen's car further into the intersection, where it is struck by Laura Koskinen's Mercedes-Benz Sprinter, which was following closely behind Hietala’s LCV.

**Witness Statements:**

1. **Pedestrian Witness - Name: Olli Mäkelä:**
   - Statement: "I was walking my dog near the intersection when I saw Mr. Kivinen slow down but not stop at the stop sign. Ms. Pietilä's car seemed to hydroplane on the wet road, unable to avoid a collision."

2. **Business Owner - Name: Anna Rautio:**
   - Statement: "I was in my shop on Kauppakatu and heard screeching tires followed by a loud crash. The rain was quite heavy; it was difficult to see through the downpour."

**Impact of Weather Conditions:**

The heavy rain significantly impaired visibility and created slippery road conditions, contributing factors in the drivers' inability to react appropriately to the traffic signals and each other's movements. All vehicles involved sustained considerable damage, and fortunately, no serious injuries were reported among the drivers or passengers.

**Investigation Status:**

The scene was secured, and all parties involved were accounted for. Preliminary investigations suggest that Drivers Kivinen and Hietala will be cited for failing to yield right of way and driving in hazardous conditions, respectively. Further analysis of vehicle data recorders (black boxes) is underway to corroborate witness statements and determine exact speeds at the time of impact.
