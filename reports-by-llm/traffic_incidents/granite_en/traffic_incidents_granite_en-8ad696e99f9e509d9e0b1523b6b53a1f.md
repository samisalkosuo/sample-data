**Traffic Incident Report**

*Incident Number:* 2024-SOT-012  
*Date of Incident:* 06.10.2024  
*Location:* Intersection of Kauppakatu and Ratinauksenkatu, Sottunga, Finland  
*Reporting Officer:* Inspector Jouko Hietala, Sottunga Police Department  

**Narrative:**

On the evening of 06.10.24, at approximately 21:30 hours, a two-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ratinauksenkatu in the municipality of Sottunga, Finland. The incident involved a grey 2018 Volvo V60, registered with the license plate 923-ABC, driven by Mr. Mikko Kivinen, a 45-year-old local resident, and a white 2020 Toyota Corolla, identified by its license plate number 12A-DEF, operated by Ms. Anna Pitkänen, a 30-year-old resident of nearby Kuopio.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **21:28 hours:** Mr. Kivinen, driving northbound on Kauppakatu towards the intersection, encountered mixed snow and rain conditions. The road surface was slick due to recent precipitation, reducing visibility and traction.

- **21:29 hours:** Ms. Pitkänen, traveling eastbound on Ratinauksenkatu approaching the intersection, also faced challenging weather conditions. Her vehicle's headlights illuminated the swirling snow mixed with rain, making it difficult to discern traffic signals and pedestrians clearly.

- **21:30 hours:** Both vehicles entered the intersection simultaneously. Mr. Kivinen proceeded through a green light, intending to turn left onto Ratinauksenkatu. Ms. Pitkänen, meanwhile, was navigating a stop sign on Ratinauksenkatu and attempted to yield to oncoming traffic but misjudged the speed of Mr. Kivinen's vehicle due to reduced visibility from the adverse weather conditions.

- **21:30:15 hours:** The front passenger side of Ms. Pitkänen’s Toyota Corolla collided with the driver's side front of Mr. Kivinen’s Volvo V60. Both vehicles sustained damage, primarily to their front ends, with significant scraping and denting evident on both vehicles.

**Witnesses:**

Two passersby, Mr. Jari Lehtinen and Ms. Laura Mäkelä, witnessed the incident from a nearby café on Kauppakatu. They immediately contacted emergency services at 21:31 hours, reporting the collision and providing descriptions of both vehicles and their respective drivers.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The prevailing weather conditions were described as mixed snow and rain, with reduced visibility and slippery road surfaces. These conditions likely contributed to the misjudgment made by Ms. Pitkänen regarding Mr. Kivinen's vehicle speed and distance.

**Vehicle Damages:**

- The Volvo V60 (license plate 923-ABC) suffered damage predominantly to its front passenger side, including a bent fender and scratches along the door.

- The Toyota Corolla (license plate 12A-DEF) sustained damage to its front driver's side, evidenced by a crumpled hood and a dented bumper.

**Actions Taken:**

Emergency services were promptly dispatched, arriving at the scene within eight minutes. Both drivers were assessed for injuries; neither required hospitalization beyond basic first aid at the scene. The vehicles were towed away for detailed inspection and repair. No further action was deemed necessary beyond standard reporting procedures.

**Report Conclusion:**

This report details a collision resulting from adverse weather conditions impacting visibility and road traction, leading to a misjudgment in yielding right-of-way at an intersection. Both drivers were cooperative, and no citations were issued given the extenuating circumstances. Further investigation into potential improvements to street lighting and signage at this intersection is recommended to mitigate similar incidents in future weather events.
