**Narrative:**

On the afternoon of 30th March 2023, at approximately 14:15 hours, a four-vehicle traffic incident occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Metsäntie in Reisjärvi, Finland. The weather conditions were icy, with temperatures hovering just above freezing, contributing to slippery road surfaces.

The vehicles involved were:
1. A silver 2018 Toyota Corolla, registered as FIN-123A, driven by Ms. Anna Pietilä, a local teacher residing at Kauppakatu 45, Reisjärvi.
2. A blue 2020 Ford Focus, registered as FIN-987B, operated by Mr. Jussi Koskinen, a construction worker from Metsäntie 12, Reisjärvi.
3. A white 2016 Volkswagen Passat, identified with registration FIN-456D, driven by Ms. Laura Rantanen, an accountant living on Kauppakatu 200, Reisjärvi.
4. A grey 2019 Honda Civic, bearing the license plate FIN-321E, driven by Mr. Samuli Mäkelä, a student from Metsäntie 56, Reisjärvi.

According to witness statements and on-scene evidence, Ms. Pietilä was proceeding northbound on Kauppakatu approaching the intersection with Metsäntie. Mr. Koskinen, traveling southbound on Metsäntie, attempted to turn left across Kauppakatu but lost control of his vehicle due to icy conditions. His Ford Focus slid into the path of Ms. Pietilä's Corolla.

Simultaneously, Ms. Rantanen in her Passat was southbound on Metsäntie, following Mr. Koskinen. She attempted to avoid a collision by braking but skidded on the icy road, colliding with the rear of Mr. Koskinen's Ford Focus. Meanwhile, Mr. Mäkelä, driving his Civic northbound on Kauppakatu, was unable to stop in time and collided with the front of Ms. Pietilä’s Corolla.
