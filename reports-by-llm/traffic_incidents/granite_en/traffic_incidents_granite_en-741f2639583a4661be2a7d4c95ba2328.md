**Narrative:**

On the evening of 02.02.2024, at approximately 21:30 hours, a two-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ruotsalanpuro in the municipality of Laitila, Finland. The incident involved a grey 2018 Volvo V60, registered with the license plate 123-ABC, driven by Mr. Mikko Kivinen, a 45-year-old local resident, and a silver 2020 Toyota Corolla, identified by its license plate number 456-DEF, operated by Ms. Anna Pitkänen, a 32-year-old resident of nearby Kuopio.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **21:28 hours:** Ms. Pitkänen, driving westbound on Ruotsalanpuro, approached the uncontrolled intersection with Kauppakatu. The thunderstorm, which had begun at around 20:45 hours, reduced visibility and made road conditions slippery due to recent rainfall.

- **21:29 hours:** Mr. Kivinen, traveling southbound on Kauppakatu, entered the intersection without noticing Ms. Pitkänen's vehicle due to the adverse weather conditions.

- **21:30 hours:** The collision occurred when the front passenger side of Mr. Kivinen’s Volvo struck the driver's side of Ms. Pitkänen’s Toyota. Both vehicles came to a stop, partially blocking the intersection.

**Witnesses and Additional Information:**

A passerby, Mr. Jussi Rantala, who was walking his dog along Kauppakatu, witnessed the incident and immediately called emergency services at 21:31 hours. He reported that both drivers appeared shaken but uninjured.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The thunderstorm, characterized by heavy rain and occasional lightning, significantly impaired visibility. The road surface was wet, contributing to reduced traction for the vehicles involved. No road maintenance or hazard warnings were reported prior to the incident.

**Vehicle Damage:**

- The Volvo V60 sustained damage primarily to its front passenger side, including a dented fender and a cracked headlight.

- The Toyota Corolla incurred damage on its driver's side, with a bent door and scratches along the paneling.

**Conclusion:**

The collision appears to have resulted from a failure to yield right-of-way under adverse weather conditions. Both drivers were cooperative during the investigation, and no signs of impairment were detected. No further action beyond standard reporting procedures was deemed necessary at this time. The incident serves as a reminder for drivers to exercise caution during inclement weather.
