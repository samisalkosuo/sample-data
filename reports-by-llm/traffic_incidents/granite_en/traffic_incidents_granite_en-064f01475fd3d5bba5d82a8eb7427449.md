**Traffic Incident Report**

*Incident Number:* 2024-RIS-0721  
*Date of Incident:* 21st July 2024  
*Location:* Intersection of Kauppakatu and Ristilanpuu, Ristijärvi, Finland  
*Reporting Officer:* Inspector Jouko Hietala, Ristijärvi Police Department  

**Narrative:**

On the morning of 21st July 2024, at approximately 08:35 hours, a four-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ristilanpuu in the municipality of Ristijärvi, Finland. The weather was overcast, with reduced visibility contributing to the complexity of the incident.

The vehicles involved were:
1. A silver 2020 Toyota Corolla, registered KY-1234, driven by Ms. Anna Pitkänen, a local teacher residing at 12 Ristilanpuutie.
2. A blue 2018 Ford Focus, registered LI-5678, operated by Mr. Mikko Koskinen, a construction worker from 34 Kauppakatu.
3. A white 2019 Volkswagen Golf, identified as LV-9101, driven by Ms. Laura Virtanen, a nurse living at 56 Kauppakatu.
4. A grey 2022 Honda Civic, bearing the plates HC-2345, driven by Mr. Jussi Rantala, an IT specialist from 78 Ristilanpuu.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **08:28 hours:** Ms. Pitkänen, driving her Toyota Corolla southbound on Kauppakatu, approached the intersection intending to turn left onto Ristilanpuu. Mr. Koskinen in his Ford Focus was travelling north on Kauppakatu, proceeding straight through the intersection. Ms. Virtanen in her Volkswagen Golf was heading east on Ristilanpuu, preparing to turn left onto Kauppakatu. Mr. Rantala, in his Honda Civic, was travelling west on Ristilanpuu, also intending to turn left onto Kauppakatu.

- **08:30 hours:** As all vehicles entered the intersection due to the overcast conditions reducing visibility, a misjudgment of speed and distance occurred. Ms. Pitkänen initiated her left turn without fully clearing oncoming traffic, colliding with Mr. Rantala's Honda Civic. This impact caused Mr. Rantala to lose control, his vehicle drifting into the path of Ms. Virtanen’s Volkswagen Golf.

- **08:32 hours:** The force of the collision between the Civic and Golf propelled both vehicles into a spin, with the Golf striking Mr. Koskinen's Ford Focus as it continued through the intersection. All vehicles sustained damage, primarily to their front ends, with airbags deploying in all except Mr. Rantala’s vehicle, which had been struck after losing initial control.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The overcast skies resulted in reduced visibility, contributing to the drivers' misjudgments of speed and distance. While there were no reported road hazards, the combination of early morning light and cloud cover impaired sightlines at the intersection, exacerbating the severity of the collision.

**Damage Descriptions:**

- The Toyota Corolla (KY-1234) sustained damage to its front passenger side, with significant scraping along the driver's door.
- The Ford Focus (LI-5678) bore dents on its front driver’s side and passenger door, with a crumpled hood.
- The Volkswagen Golf (LV-9101) showed damage to its front left corner, including a bent bumper and headlight.
- The Honda Civic (HC-2345) had front-end collision damage, with the passenger side suffering the brunt of the impact.

**Injuries:**

All occupants sustained minor to moderate injuries, primarily from airbag deployment. Ms. Pitkänen and Mr. Rantala were transported to the nearest hospital for precautionary checks, while Mr. Koskinen and Ms. Virtanen declined medical attention at the scene.

**Investigation Status:**

The scene was secured, and all vehicles were towed for detailed examination. Witness statements from passersby, including Ms. Liisa Mäkelä and Mr. Jari Pekkarinen, corroborate the sequence of events described above. The investigation is ongoing to determine liability and potential charges.
