**Traffic Incident Report**

*Incident Number:* 231216-FI-SIE-001  
*Date of Incident:* 16 December 2023  
*Location:* Sievi, Finland  
*Reporting Officer:* Inspector Jari Pietiläinen  

**Narrative:**

On the evening of 16 December 2023, at approximately 18:45 hours, a two-vehicle collision occurred on Kauppakatu, a primary thoroughfare in the municipality of Sievi, Finland. The incident involved a grey 2019 Toyota Corolla, registered with the license plate '345-SIX', driven by Mr. Mikko Hietala, a 38-year-old local resident, and a silver 2020 Ford Focus, identified by its license plate '789-KIE', operated by Ms. Anna Kaski, a 25-year-old residing in nearby Vihti.

**Timeline of Events:**

1. **18:30 hours**: Mr. Hietala was driving westbound on Kauppakatu towards the town centre from his residence at 123 Kauppakatu, Sievi. Ms. Kaski was travelling eastbound from the opposite direction, en route to her apartment at 456 Kauppakatu.

2. **18:38 hours**: As Mr. Hietala approached the intersection with Pohjoiskatu, a side street known for its sharp curve, strong gusts of wind, part of a larger weather system moving through the region, began to affect visibility and vehicle control.

3. **18:40 hours**: Ms. Kaski, having just passed the intersection with Pohjoiskatu, noticed Mr. Hietala's vehicle swerving slightly due to wind gusts. She attempted to adjust her speed to provide a safer distance but was unable to avoid a collision as Mr. Hietala's Corolla drifted into her lane.

4. **18:42 hours**: The vehicles collided near the midpoint of Kauppakatu, approximately 50 meters west of Pohjoiskatu. The impact caused significant damage to both vehicles. Mr. Hietala's Corolla sustained substantial front-end damage, including a collapsed front fender and a damaged headlight. Ms. Kaski's Focus suffered side panel damage and a bent passenger-side door.

**Weather Conditions:**

The prevailing weather at the time of the incident was windy with gusts reaching up to 50 km/h, reducing visibility and making driving conditions challenging. Although no precipitation was reported, the strong winds contributed to the difficulty in maintaining vehicle control, as evidenced by Mr. Hietala's initial swerving.

**Witnesses:**

Two passersby, Ms. Laura Korhonen and Mr. Jussi Rantanen, witnessed the incident from a nearby café on Kauppakatu. They reported that both drivers appeared shaken but uninjured following the collision. Emergency services were promptly alerted, and both individuals declined medical transport to the scene.

**Damage Description:**

- **Toyota Corolla (345-SIX):** Front-end damage, including a collapsed fender, cracked bumper, and a damaged headlight. Airbag deployment was noted, indicating potential occupant restraint during the impact.

- **Ford Focus (789-KIE):** Side panel damage, bent passenger-side door, and scratches along the driver's side from the collision. No airbag deployment was reported.

**Conclusion:**

The collision appears to have resulted primarily from adverse weather conditions affecting vehicle control rather than driver error. Both drivers were cooperative with investigators, and no indications of impairment or reckless driving were observed. The incident serves as a reminder of the importance of vigilance and reduced speeds during inclement weather.
