**Incident Description:**

On the aforementioned date and time, at approximately 14:30 hours, a two-vehicle collision occurred on Kauppakatu, a major thoroughfare in Utajärvi. The incident involved a grey 2018 Toyota Corolla, registered under the name of Jari Koskinen, residing at Kauppiasentie 12, and a silver 2020 Ford Focus, driven by local resident, Marko Hietala, from Vuorikontuunpuisto 5.

**Narrative:**

Jari Koskinen was driving his Toyota Corolla (license plate 123-AB-45) westbound on Kauppakatu towards the town centre during a heavy thunderstorm. The rain intensified, reducing visibility and making the road slick with accumulated water. As he approached the intersection with Metsänkylä street, Koskinen reportedly failed to notice the stop sign due to the poor weather conditions.

Meanwhile, Marko Hietala was driving his Ford Focus (license plate 678-XY-90) eastbound on Kauppakatu, proceeding cautiously but still unable to avoid the Corolla that entered the intersection without stopping. The front of Hietala's vehicle collided with the passenger side of Koskinen's car, causing significant damage to both vehicles.

**Witnesses:**

Two pedestrians, Anna Pitkäranta and Olli Rantanen, who were seeking shelter from the storm at a nearby café, witnessed the incident. They confirmed that Koskinen's vehicle entered the intersection without stopping and that Hietala attempted to swerve but was unable to prevent the collision due to the wet road conditions.
