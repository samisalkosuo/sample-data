**Narrative:**

On the evening of 16th July 2025, at approximately 21:45 hours, a two-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ratinkatu in the municipality of Iisalmi, Finland. The incident involved a grey 2018 Volvo V60, registered with the license plate 34-VLO-I, driven by Mr. Mikko Kivinen, a 39-year-old local resident, and a silver 2020 Toyota Corolla, identified by its license plate 12-TYC-F, operated by Ms. Anna Pitkänen, a 25-year-old resident of the nearby village of Kuopio.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **21:40 hours:** Mr. Kivinen was driving westbound on Kauppakatu towards the intersection with Ratinkatu. Ms. Pitkänen was traveling southbound on Ratinkatu approaching the same intersection.
- **21:43 hours:** Both drivers were navigating through wet and slippery road conditions due to recent rainfall, which had left the asphalt surface hazardous. Visibility was reduced but not severely impaired by darkness, as streetlights illuminated the area.
- **21:44 hours:** As Mr. Kivinen approached the stop line at Ratinkatu, he proceeded to make a left turn intending to head south on Ratinkatu. Ms. Pitkänen, traveling at the speed limit of 50 km/h, was approximately 80 meters from the intersection.
- **21:45 hours:** The collision occurred when Mr. Kivinen's Volvo turned left in front of Ms. Pitkänen’s path. The front passenger side of the Corolla collided with the driver's side of the Volvo, resulting in significant damage to both vehicles.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The roads were wet and slippery due to intermittent rainfall over the preceding hour. While there was no heavy downpour at the time of the incident, residual moisture combined with cooler temperatures created a slick surface, contributing to reduced traction for both drivers.

**Vehicle Damage:**

- The Volvo V60 sustained damage primarily to its driver's side, including a crumpled front fender and hood, along with minor damage to the rear passenger side. Airbag deployment was noted, indicating occupant restraint during the collision.
- The Toyota Corolla showed impact damage on its front passenger side, affecting the headlight and fender. There were no signs of airbag deployment, suggesting that Ms. Pitkänen was wearing her seatbelt at the time of the incident.

**Witnesses:**

Two pedestrians, Mr. Jussi Laine and Ms. Leena Rantanen, witnessed the incident from a nearby café on Kauppakatu. They reported that both drivers applied their brakes immediately upon realizing the impending collision but were unable to avoid impact due to the slippery conditions.

**Further Investigation:**

Both drivers were transported to Iisalmi Central Hospital for precautionary checks and released with no serious injuries. Their vehicles were towed to a secure location for detailed examination by forensic experts. Road condition assessments will be conducted to evaluate if maintenance procedures are necessary following this incident.

**Report Conclusion:**
