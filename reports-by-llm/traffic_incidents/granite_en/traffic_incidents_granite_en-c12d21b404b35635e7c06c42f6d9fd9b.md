**Narrative:**

On the morning of 01 June 2025, at approximately 08:45 hours, a three-vehicle traffic incident occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ristimäenkangas in Puumala, Finland. The vehicles involved were a white 2019 Toyota Corolla, registered as FIN-123-A, driven by Mr. Mikko Kivinen, 34, of Kauppakatu 56; a grey 2020 Ford Focus, registered as FIN-456-B, operated by Ms. Sanna Pietilä, 28, from Ristimäenkangas 12; and a black 2017 Volkswagen Golf, identified as FIN-789-C, driven by Mr. Jussi Lindstrom, 45, residing at Kauppakatu 34.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **08:40 hours:** Ms. Pietilä, driving the Ford Focus, approached the intersection from the north on Ristimäenkangas heading towards Kauppakatu. Mr. Kivinen, in the Toyota Corolla, was waiting at a stop sign on Kauppakatu intending to turn left onto Ristimäenkangas.
- **08:41 hours:** Mr. Lindstrom, driving the Volkswagen Golf, proceeded southbound along Kauppakatu towards the same intersection. He was distracted by a mobile device and failed to notice the stop sign.
- **08:42 hours:** As Mr. Lindstrom entered the intersection without stopping, he collided with Ms. Pietilä's Ford Focus, which had the right of way. The impact caused Ms. Pietilä’s vehicle to spin, striking Mr. Kivinen's Toyota Corolla on its passenger side as it waited to turn left.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The morning was characterized by mixed precipitation—a combination of light snowfall and intermittent rain. The roads were wet, reducing visibility and traction. The intersection lacked adequate signage for the prevailing weather conditions, contributing to Mr. Lindstrom's failure to observe the stop sign.

**Vehicle Damage:**

- **Toyota Corolla (FIN-123-A):** Significant damage to the passenger side, including a dented door and shattered window.  
- **Ford Focus (FIN-456-B):** Frontal collision damage, bent hood, and front bumper.  
- **Volkswagen Golf (FIN-789-C):** Front-end impact with a crumpled fender and headlight.

**Witness Statements:**

A passerby, Ms. Aino Mäkelä, provided a statement confirming the sequence of events and corroborating the descriptions of vehicle movements. She noted that the road conditions were slippery due to the mixed snow and rain, which may have contributed to the severity of the collisions.

**Conclusion:**

The incident was primarily caused by Mr. Lindstrom's negligence in failing to adhere to traffic signals while distracted by his mobile device during hazardous weather conditions. All parties involved sustained minor injuries, and emergency medical services transported them to Puumalainen Hospital for evaluation. The Finnish Traffic Management Centre has been notified to review intersection safety measures in light of this incident.
