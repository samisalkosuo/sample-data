**Narrative:**

On the evening of 24.03.2023, at approximately 18:15 hours, a three-vehicle traffic incident occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ruotsalanpuro in the municipality of Nousiainen, Finland. The primary contributors to this collision were drivers Mikko Pietilä, operating a silver 2018 Volvol V60 with license plate 345-VI, and Anna Kaski, driving a blue 2020 Ford Focus ST-Line bearing the registration number 789-AN. A third vehicle, a red 2017 Toyota Corolla driven by Olli Rantala with license plate 123-OR, was involved as a result of the initial impacts.

**Timeline:**

- **18:05 hours:** Mikko Pietilä, traveling westbound on Kauppakatu towards the intersection, encountered windy conditions with gusts affecting visibility and vehicle control.
- **18:10 hours:** Anna Kaski, approaching from the north on Ruotsalanpuro intending to turn left onto Kauppakatu, misjudged the speed of oncoming traffic due to the windy conditions.
- **18:12 hours:** As Pietilä's Volvo neared the intersection, Kaski initiated her left turn in front of Pietilä’s path. The collision occurred when Kaski's Ford Focus was struck on its passenger side by Pietilä's vehicle.
- **18:13 hours:** The impact caused Kaski's vehicle to spin, colliding with Olli Rantala's Toyota Corolla, which was traveling eastbound on Kauppakatu and unable to avoid the incident due to reduced traction from wind gusts.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The prevailing weather conditions during the time of the incident were described as windy with intermittent gusts, reducing visibility and making road surfaces slippery. These conditions contributed significantly to the drivers' inability to maintain control over their vehicles, especially at a critical intersection where caution is paramount.

**Vehicle Damage:**

- Mikko Pietilä's Volvo V60 sustained damage primarily to its front bumper and hood, with noticeable scrapes along the driver’s side.
- Anna Kaski's Ford Focus ST-Line incurred significant damage on its passenger side, including a dented door and scratches along the side panel.
- Olli Rantala's Toyota Corolla suffered rear-end damage, with the trunk lid crumpled and taillights shattered from the impact.

**Witnesses:**

Two pedestrians, Sari Hietala and Jussi Koskinen, who were present at a nearby bus stop, provided statements corroborating the sequence of events. They reported that both drivers appeared distracted by the windy conditions just prior to the collision.

**Conclusion:**

The traffic incident was primarily caused by adverse weather conditions leading to misjudgments in speed and distance by the drivers involved. All parties were advised, and no criminal charges were warranted given the circumstances. Recommendations for driver education on handling vehicles in challenging weather have been forwarded to local authorities for consideration.
