**Incident Summary:**

On the night of 07.11.2022, at approximately 23:15 hours, a two-vehicle collision occurred on Kauppakatu Street in Saarijärvi, Finland. The incident involved a white 2018 Volvo V60, registered under the name of Jari Koskinen, residing at Kauppiplatsi 12, and a silver 2020 Toyota Corolla, driven by local resident, Eeva Pietilä, from Hyytialankoski 34.

**Narrative of Events:**

At the time of the incident, Koskinen was traveling southbound on Kauppakatu Street towards the town center. Pietilä was proceeding northbound in the opposite direction. The icy road conditions, exacerbated by intermittent light snowfall, contributed to reduced visibility and traction for both drivers.

As Koskinen approached the intersection with Metsänkatu, he reportedly attempted to navigate a right turn onto the residential street. According to witness statements from passersby on Metsänkatu, Koskinen's vehicle drifted slightly onto the wrong side of the road due to the icy conditions before correcting his path.

Simultaneously, Pietilä, approaching from the north, was preparing to make a left turn into a nearby grocery store parking lot on her side of Kauppakatu Street. She reportedly misjudged the distance and speed of oncoming traffic due to the poor visibility caused by the icy roads and falling snow.

The collision occurred when Pietilä's Toyota Corolla, traveling at a moderate speed, entered Koskinen’s lane, resulting in a frontal impact with the passenger side of the Volvo V60. Both vehicles sustained significant damage; the Volvo's front passenger door was crushed, and its hood was severely dented. The Corolla suffered extensive damage to the driver’s side, including a collapsed front fender and a bent door.
