**Narrative:**

On the evening of 24th September 2024, at approximately 21:30 hours, a two-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ratinauksenranta in the municipality of Geta, Finland. The incident involved a silver 2019 Toyota Corolla, driven by Mr. Mikko Kivinen, age 34, residing at Kauppakatu 123, and a blue 2020 Ford Focus, operated by Ms. Anna Pitkänen, age 28, from Ratinauksenranta 456.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **21:25 hours:** Mr. Kivinen, driving northbound on Kauppakatu towards the intersection, failed to fully stop at the stop sign due to a momentary lapse in attention, as confirmed by a passenger, Ms. Sanna Lehtinen.

- **21:26 hours:** Ms. Pitkänen, travelling eastbound on Ratinauksenranta, approached the intersection with the traffic signal displaying red. She maintained a lawful speed and was in compliance with all traffic regulations.

- **21:27 hours:** The Toyota Corolla entered the intersection against the red light, colliding with the front passenger side of the Ford Focus, which had the right of way. The impact caused significant damage to both vehicles.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The night was clear and sunny, with no adverse weather conditions reported. The roads were dry, and visibility was optimal, posing no hindrance to normal driving conditions. However, the glare from streetlights may have contributed to Mr. Kivinen's momentary distraction.

**Vehicle Details and Damage:**

- **Toyota Corolla (Finland License Plate 123-TO):** Sustained substantial damage to the front passenger side, including a crumpled fender, damaged headlight, and a dented door. Airbag deployment was noted, indicating occupant restraint during the collision.

- **Ford Focus (Finland License Plate 456-FO):** Experienced impact on the front passenger side, resulting in a bent hood, broken headlight, and damage to the passenger door. No airbag deployment was reported, suggesting no occupant was in the passenger seat at the time of the collision.

**Witnesses:**

A local resident, Mr. Jari Hietala, who lives adjacent to the intersection on Kauppakatu, witnessed the incident and provided a statement corroborating Ms. Lehtinen's account of Mr. Kivinen's failure to stop completely at the stop sign.

**Action Taken:**

Both drivers were transported to the nearby Pirkanmaa Hospital for precautionary checks, reporting no serious injuries. The vehicles were towed from the scene by a local recovery service. Mr. Kivinen was issued a citation for failing to obey a traffic control device (stop sign). Further investigation is ongoing to determine if additional charges may apply concerning distracted driving due to potential mobile phone use, as suggested by Ms. Lehtinen's statement.
