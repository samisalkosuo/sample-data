*Incident Number:* 2024-VTA-0921  
*Date of Incident:* 21st September 2024  
*Location:* Intersection of Kauppakatu and Ruohoniekusiedunkatu, Vantaa, Finland  
*Reporting Officer:* Inspector Jouko Mäkelä  
*Municipality:* Vantaa  

**Narrative:**

On the evening of 21st September 2024, at approximately 21:30 hours, a two-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ruohoniekusiedunkatu in Vantaa, Finland. The incident involved a grey 2018 Volvo XC60, registered with the license plate 123-ABC, driven by Mr. Mikko Hietanen, a 45-year-old resident of nearby Kauppiaveenstä, and a silver 2020 Toyota Corolla, registered with the license plate 456-DEF, operated by Ms. Anna Pitkänen, a 32-year-old inhabitant of Ruohoniekusiedutie, Vantaa.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **21:28 hours:** Mr. Hietanen, driving westbound on Kauppakatu towards the intersection, encountered mixed snow and rain conditions. The road surface was slick due to recent precipitation, reducing visibility and traction.
  
- **21:29 hours:** Ms. Pitkänen, traveling southbound on Ruohoniekusiedunkatu approaching the intersection, also faced similar adverse weather conditions. She was unaware of Mr. Hietanen's approach due to a partially obstructed view caused by parked vehicles and heavy rainfall.

- **21:30 hours:** As Ms. Pitkänen proceeded through the intersection, she failed to yield the right of way to Mr. Hietanen’s vehicle. The Volvo XC60, unable to stop in time due to the wet and slippery road conditions, collided with the passenger side of Ms. Pitkänen's Toyota Corolla.

- **21:31 hours:** Following the impact, both vehicles came to a halt, partially blocking the intersection. A passerby, Mr. Jari Koskinen from 45 Kauppiaveenstä, immediately stopped to render assistance and called emergency services at 21:32 hours.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The prevailing weather conditions during the incident were mixed snow and rain, significantly impairing visibility and road grip. The temperature was approximately 6°C, with a light drizzle and intermittent snow flurries reducing the effectiveness of headlights and increasing the risk of skidding.

**Vehicle Damage:**

The Volvo XC60 sustained damage primarily to its passenger side, including a dented door, a cracked headlight, and scrapes along the side panel. The Toyota Corolla incurred damage to its passenger side as well, with a bent fender, a broken tail light, and scratches on the rear quarter panel.

**Witnesses:**

Mr. Jari Koskinen, residing at 45 Kauppiaveenstä, provided a statement confirming he saw Ms. Pitkänen enter the intersection without yielding to Mr. Hietanen's vehicle. He also noted the poor visibility due to weather conditions and parked cars obstructing views.

**Conclusion:**

The collision was primarily caused by Ms. Pitkänen’s failure to yield right of way, exacerbated by challenging mixed snow and rain conditions that reduced both drivers' ability to react effectively. Both drivers were transported to Vantaa Hospital for precautionary checks and released with no serious injuries reported. No further action was deemed necessary beyond standard reporting procedures.
