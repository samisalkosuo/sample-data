**Narrative:**

On the evening of 23 April 2023, at approximately 18:15 hours, a two-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ruotsalanpuro in the municipality of Lempäälä, Finland. The incident involved a grey 2018 Toyota Corolla, driven by Mr. Petteri Hietala, 34, of Kauppakatu 56, and a silver 2020 Ford Focus, operated by Ms. Anna-Liisa Koskinen, 29, of Ruotsalanpuro 12.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **18:00 - 18:10 hours:** Light rain began falling in Lempäälä, creating slippery road conditions on Kauppakatu and Ruotsalanpuro.

- **18:12 hours:** Mr. Hietala, travelling westbound on Kauppakatu towards the intersection, approached the stop sign. Witnesses reported that he may have misjudged the stopping distance due to the wet road surface.

- **18:13 hours:** Ms. Koskinen, driving southbound on Ruotsalanpuro, proceeded through the intersection with a green light. She stated that she saw Mr. Hietala's vehicle moments before the collision but was unable to avoid it due to the wet conditions and reduced visibility.
