**Narrative:**

On the morning of 22nd February 2024, at approximately 09:15 hours, a multi-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ruotsalanpuro in Pyhäntä, Finland. The incident involved six vehicles, resulting in minor injuries to the drivers and passengers involved.

The primary vehicles involved were:
1. A silver 2020 Toyota Corolla, registered KY-1234, driven by Mr. Mikko Koskinen, 34, of Ruotsalanpuro 12, Pyhäntä.
2. A blue 2018 Volvo V60, registered PY-5678, driven by Ms. Sanna Pitkänen, 29, of Kauppakatu 45, Pyhäntä.
3. A red 2015 Ford Focus, registered RL-9101, driven by Mr. Jari Lindstrom, 42, of Kauppakatu 21, Pyhäntä.
4. A white 2017 Honda Civic, registered HC-2345, driven by Ms. Anna Mäkelä, 30, of Ruotsalanpuro 9, Pyhäntä.
5. A grey 2016 Nissan Qashqai, registered NQ-6789, driven by Mr. Olli Virtanen, 50, of Kauppakatu 34, Pyhäntä.
6. A black 2019 Dacia Sandero, registered DS-0123, driven by Ms. Kaisa Rantala, 27, of Ruotsalanpuro 15, Pyhäntä.

Witnesses at the scene reported that Mr. Koskinen was proceeding north on Kauppakatu towards its junction with Ruotsalanpuro. Ms. Pitkänen, travelling east on Ruotsalanpuro, attempted to turn left across Kauppakatu but collided with Mr. Koskinen's vehicle. This initial impact caused Mr. Koskinen's car to spin, striking Mr. Lindstrom's Ford Focus and Ms. Mäkelä's Honda Civic, both travelling in the same direction on Kauppakatu.

The force of these collisions propelled Mr. Lindstrom’s vehicle into the path of Mr. Virtanen’s Nissan Qashqai, which was following closely behind. Simultaneously, Ms. Mäkelä's Honda Civic collided with the rear of the Dacia Sandero driven by Ms. Rantala, who was stationary in the inside lane due to a slowing traffic queue ahead.

**Timeline of Events:**

- 09:14 hours: Vehicles approaching intersection, all signaled and proceeding within speed limits under clear, sunny weather conditions.
- 09:15 hours: Ms. Pitkänen initiates left turn across Kauppakatu, colliding with Mr. Koskinen's Toyota Corolla.
- 09:15-09:16 hours: Subsequent chain reactions occur as Mr. Koskinen’s vehicle spins, impacting Mr. Lindstrom and Ms. Mäkelä, who in turn collide with Mr. Virtanen and Ms. Rantala.
- 09:16 hours: All involved vehicles come to a stop, with minor debris scattered across the roadway.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The weather on the day of the incident was clear and sunny, with no adverse conditions reported that could have contributed to the collision. Road surfaces were dry, providing good traction for vehicles. However, the bright sunlight may have temporarily impaired visibility for some drivers, contributing to the left-turn misjudgment by Ms. Pitkänen.

**Vehicle Damage:**

1. Toyota Corolla (KY-1234): Front-end damage, airbags deployed; driver, Mikko Koskinen, sustained minor injuries.
2. Volvo V60 (PY-5678): Left side panel and door dented; passenger, Sanna Pitkänen, reported minor whiplash.
3. Ford Focus (RL-9101): Rear-end damage; driver, Jari Lindstrom, sustained minor cuts from broken glass.
4. Honda Civic (HC-2345): Front-end and passenger side damage; driver, Anna Mäkelä, reported mild shock.
5. Nissan Qashqai (NQ-6789): Rear-end damage; driver, Olli Virtanen, sustained minor bruising from seatbelt restraint.
6. Dacia Sandero (DS-0123): Rear-end damage; passenger, Kaisa Rantala, reported mild whiplash.

**Conclusion:**

The collision was primarily caused by a left-turn misjudgment in clear weather conditions. All drivers involved were cooperative and provided consistent statements regarding the sequence of events. No citations were issued at the scene, but all parties were advised to exercise greater caution when making turns across intersecting traffic flows, especially during periods of high sunlight.
