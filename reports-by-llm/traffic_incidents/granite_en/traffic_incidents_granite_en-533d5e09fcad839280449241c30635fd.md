**Narrative:**

On the evening of 07.05.2025, at approximately 21:45 hours, a four-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ruotsilanmäki in Loviisa, Finland. The incident involved Mr. Mikko Pietilä, 38, a local resident driving a grey 2019 Volvo V60 with license plate 123-AB-45, proceeding northbound on Kauppakatu; Ms. Anna Rautiainen, 27, a teacher from nearby Helsinki, operating a white 2020 Toyota Corolla (license plate 678-XY-90), traveling eastbound on Ruotsilanmäki; Mr. Jussi Kivinen, 45, a construction worker residing in nearby Sipoo, driving a black 2017 Ford Focus (license plate 345-MN-67), heading southbound on Kauppakatu; and Ms. Eeva Lehtinen, 32, a nurse from Loviisa, behind the wheel of a red 2016 Honda Civic (license plate 987-KL-23), approaching the intersection from Ruotsilanmäki heading west.

Witnesses at the scene, including Mr. Petteri Koskinen and Ms. Sanna Virtanen, reported that Mr. Pietilä failed to stop at the clearly marked stop sign on Kauppakatu, colliding with Ms. Rautiainen's Toyota Corolla as she had the right of way. The impact caused Ms. Rautiainen’s vehicle to spin, subsequently striking Mr. Kivinen's Ford Focus, which was waiting at the intersection. The force of this second collision then propelled Mr. Kivinen's car into Ms. Lehtinen's Honda Civic, causing significant damage to all four vehicles involved.

**Timeline:**

- 21:40 hours: All vehicles approaching the intersection with clear visibility despite overcast weather conditions.
- 21:43 hours: Mr. Pietilä enters the intersection without stopping at the stop sign, initiating the collision with Ms. Rautiainen's vehicle.
- 21:44 hours: Ms. Rautiainen’s Toyota Corolla spins and collides with Mr. Kivinen’s Ford Focus.
- 21:45 hours: The impact from the previous collision propels Mr. Kivinen's car into Ms. Lehtinen's Honda Civic.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The night was overcast with reduced visibility due to low cloud cover, though no precipitation was reported. The road surface was damp but not slippery, contributing to the vehicles' reduced ability to brake effectively before impact.

**Vehicle Damage Descriptions:**

1. Mr. Pietilä's Volvo V60: Front-end damage, including a crumpled hood and damaged headlights. Airbags deployed.
2. Ms. Rautiainen's Toyota Corolla: Significant side impact damage, with the passenger door severely dented and airbags deployed.
3. Mr. Kivinen's Ford Focus: Frontal collision resulted in a crumpled front bumper and hood, along with airbag deployment.
4. Ms. Lehtinen's Honda Civic: Rear-end damage, including a smashed trunk and rear bumper, with airbags deployed.

**Injuries:**

All drivers involved sustained minor injuries and were transported to the Loviisa Central Hospital for evaluation. Passengers in each vehicle reported no serious injuries.

This report is submitted based on witness statements, physical evidence at the scene, and preliminary vehicle inspections. Further investigation, including potential charges against Mr. Pietilä for failing to stop at a stop sign, is ongoing.
