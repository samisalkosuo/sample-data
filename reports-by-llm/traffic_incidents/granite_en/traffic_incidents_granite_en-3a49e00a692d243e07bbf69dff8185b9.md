On the evening of 24th September 2024, at approximately 18:30, a two-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Metsäntie in Rantasalmi, Finland. The incident involved a white 2019 Volvo V60, registered with the license plate 123-ABC, driven by Mr. Mikko Kivinen, a 45-year-old local resident, and a silver 2020 Toyota Corolla, identified by its license plate number 456-DEF, operated by Ms. Anna Pitkänen, a 31-year-old residing in the neighboring town of Kuhmo.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **18:20**: Ms. Pitkänen departed from her workplace on Metsäntie heading towards Kauppakatu intending to turn left onto the main street. Mr. Kivinen was traveling eastbound along Kauppakatu, en route home after completing errands in Rantasalmi's central district.

- **18:25**: Fog began to descend over the area, reducing visibility significantly. The weather conditions were described as 'thick fog' by multiple witnesses.

- **18:28**: As Ms. Pitkänen approached the intersection, she signaled her intention to turn left onto Kauppakatu. Mr. Kivinen, maintaining the speed limit due to the reduced visibility, proceeded through the intersection.

- **18:30**: The vehicles collided at approximately the center of the intersection. Ms. Pitkänen's Corolla struck the passenger side of Mr. Kivinen’s Volvo, causing substantial damage to both vehicles' front ends and side panels.

**Witness Accounts:**

- **Mr. Jari Lehtinen**, a local resident living at 23 Metsäntie, reported seeing Ms. Pitkänen's vehicle emerge from the fog just moments before the collision. He described her car as traveling at a moderate speed but noted that visibility was severely compromised.

- **Ms. Laura Korhonen**, who works at a nearby bakery on Kauppakatu, stated she heard the impact and immediately rushed outside to assist. She confirmed Mr. Kivinen's vehicle was struck while proceeding through the intersection with his turn signal activated.

**Vehicle Damage:**

- The Volvo V60 sustained damage predominantly to its passenger side, including a dented door, scraped paintwork, and a damaged headlight. The airbags deployed during the impact, indicating a moderate force collision.

- The Toyota Corolla suffered frontal damage, with the front bumper caved in and scratches along the driver's side. Its airbag also deployed, suggesting similar force to that of the Volvo.

**Weather Impact:**

The foggy conditions significantly impaired visibility, contributing to the difficulty both drivers faced in navigating the intersection safely. While neither driver was cited for speeding, the reduced visibility likely played a critical role in the collision, underscoring the need for heightened caution during such weather events.
