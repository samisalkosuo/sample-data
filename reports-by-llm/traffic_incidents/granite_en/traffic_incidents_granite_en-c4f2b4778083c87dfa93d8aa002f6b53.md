**Incident Summary:**

On the night of 12 February 2024, at approximately 23:15 hours, a two-vehicle collision occurred on Kalevantie Street in Virolahti, Finland. The incident involved a silver 2018 Toyota Corolla, registered with the license plate 123-ABC, driven by Mr. Mikko Koskinen, a 34-year-old local resident of address Kalevantie 56, and a black 2020 Volvo S60, registered with the license plate 987-DEF, operated by Ms. Anna Pitkänen, a 29-year-old residing at Sankt-Peterborgskatu 14.

**Narrative of Events:**

At approximately 23:05 hours, Mr. Koskinen was driving westbound on Kalevantie Street towards the center of Virolahti under light rain conditions. The road surface was damp due to recent precipitation, reducing visibility and traction. Ms. Pitkänen was traveling eastbound on the same street at a moderate speed.

As Mr. Koskinen approached the intersection with Sankt-Peterborgskatu, he failed to fully stop at the stop sign due to the slippery conditions. Simultaneously, Ms. Pitkänen, adhering to traffic regulations, proceeded through the intersection intending to turn left onto Kalevantie Street. The collision occurred when the front passenger side of Ms. Pitkänen's Volvo struck the driver’s side front of Mr. Koskinen's Toyota Corolla.

**Witness Statements:**

A passing motorist, Mr. Jari Lehtinen, traveling eastbound on Sankt-Peterborgskatu, witnessed the incident and immediately pulled over to assist.
