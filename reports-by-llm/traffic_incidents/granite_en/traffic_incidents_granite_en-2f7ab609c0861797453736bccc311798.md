**Narrative:**

On the evening of 10th April 2025, at approximately 18:30 hours, a multi-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ruotsalanpuro in the municipality of Kiuruvesi, Finland. The incident involved five vehicles, resulting in various degrees of damage and minor injuries to the occupants.

The primary vehicles involved were:
1. A silver 2020 Toyota Corolla, registered as FIN-123XY, driven by Ms. Anna Pietilä, a local teacher residing at Kauppakatu 45, Kiuruvesi. She was proceeding northbound on Kauppakatu towards the intersection.
2. A blue 2018 Volvo V60, registered as FIN-456YZ, driven by Mr. Mikko Rantanen, a construction worker from Ruotsalanpuro 12, Kiuruvesi. He was traveling eastbound on Ruotsalanpuro approaching the intersection.
3. A red 2019 Ford Focus, registered as FIN-789AB, driven by Ms. Kaisa Lehtinen, a nurse from Kauppakatu 23, Kiuruvesi. She was following the Toyota Corolla on Kauppakatu.
4. A white 2016 Honda Civic, registered as FIN-ABCDE, driven by Mr. Jussi Kivinen, a student from Ruotsalanpuro 9, Kiuruvesi. He was proceeding westbound on Ruotsalanpuro towards the intersection.
5. A grey 2017 Nissan Qashqai, registered as FIN-EFGHI, driven by Ms. Sanna Mäkelä, a retired teacher from Kauppakatu 18, Kiuruvesi. She was waiting at the red traffic signal on Kauppakatu, intending to turn right onto Ruotsalanpuro.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **18:28 hours:** Ms. Pietilä's Toyota Corolla and Ms. Lehtinen's Ford Focus enter the intersection on a green light from Kauppakatu, proceeding northbound.
- **18:29 hours:** Mr. Rantanen's Volvo V60, traveling east on Ruotsalanpuro, approaches the intersection on a green light.
- **18:30 hours:** The vehicles collide as Mr. Rantanen's Volvo fails to stop at the red signal for Kauppakatu, striking Ms. Pietilä’s Corolla and Ms. Lehtinen’s Focus on the passenger side.
- **18:30 hours:** Simultaneously, Mr. Kivinen's Honda Civic, traveling west on Ruotsalanpuro, collides with the rear of Mr. Rantanen's Volvo.
- **18:30 hours:** Ms. Mäkelä's Nissan Qashqai, waiting to turn right onto Ruotsalanpuro, is struck by debris from the initial collisions and suffers minor damage.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The evening was overcast with reduced visibility due to low-lying cloud cover. Although there were no precipitation issues, the gloomy weather conditions contributed to decreased driver awareness and reaction times. The road surface was dry but showed signs of wear from previous rainfall, potentially affecting tire grip during emergency braking maneuvers.

**Damage Descriptions:**

1. Toyota Corolla (FIN-123XY): Significant damage to the passenger side, including a crumpled door and shattered window. Airbag deployment noted.
2. Volvo V60 (FIN-456YZ): Heavy frontal damage, with the hood caved in and headlight obliterated. Airbag deployment confirmed.
3. Ford Focus (FIN-789AB): Passenger side suffered severe impact, door mangled, and window broken out. Airbag deployed.
4. Honda Civic (FIN-ABCDE): Rear-end collision resulted in minor structural damage to the boot area and a bent rear bumper.
5. Nissan Qashqai (FIN-EFGHI): Minor cosmetic damage to the passenger side, likely from flying debris.

**Witness Statements:**

Several pedestrians witnessed the incident and provided consistent accounts. Notably, Ms. Liisa Koskinen, a local shopkeeper at Kauppakatu 30, reported seeing Mr. Rantanen's vehicle enter the intersection against the red light. Another passerby, Mr. Jouko Virtanen, noted that Ms. Mäkelä’s Nissan was stationary and appeared to be waiting for the green signal to turn right when struck by debris.

**Conclusion:**

The collision appears to have been caused primarily by Mr. Rantanen's failure to adhere to the traffic signals, compounded by the overcast conditions reducing visibility and potentially impairing his judgment. All other drivers involved were compliant with traffic regulations at the time of the incident. Charges are being considered against Mr. Rantanen for running a red light, while the other drivers and Ms. Mäkelä, as a stationary vehicle struck by debris, are not at fault.
