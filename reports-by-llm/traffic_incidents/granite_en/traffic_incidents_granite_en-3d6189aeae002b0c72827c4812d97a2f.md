**Narrative of Events:**

On the morning of 10th April 2024, at approximately 08:35 hours, a three-vehicle traffic incident occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Rannapaloenk in the municipality of Lemland, Finland. The weather conditions were mixed snow and rain, which contributed to slippery road surfaces.

The vehicles involved were:
1. A silver 2019 Volvo V60 driven by Mr. Mikko Koskinen, a local teacher residing at 45 Kauppakatu, Lemland. His passenger was Ms. Sanna Hietala, also a resident of Lemland.
2. A blue 2017 Toyota Corolla driven by Mr. Jari Pitkänen, a construction worker from 12 Rannapaloenk, Lemland. His passenger was Ms. Anna-Liisa Kivinen.
3. A red 2020 Ford Focus driven by Ms. Helmi Lehtinen, a nurse living at 78 Kauppakatu, Lemland.

According to witness statements and on-scene evidence, Mr. Koskinen was traveling eastbound on Kauppakatu approaching the intersection with Rannapaloenk. Mr. Pitkänen was proceeding westbound on Rannapaloenk intending to turn left onto Kauppakatu. Ms. Lehtinen was driving southbound on a side street leading onto Kauppakatu, preparing to continue her journey eastward.

As Mr. Koskinen's Volvo approached the intersection, it is believed that he encountered reduced traction due to the mixed snow and rain conditions. He reportedly failed to fully stop at the stop sign governing the intersection from Kauppakatu, colliding with the Toyota Corolla driven by Mr. Pitkänen. The impact caused both vehicles to spin, with the Volvo coming to rest facing north on Rannapaloenk and the Corolla stopping diagonally across the intersection.

Ms. Lehtinen, driving the Ford Focus, was proceeding cautiously but was unable to avoid the collision with the spinning Volvo. Her vehicle struck the passenger side of Mr. Koskinen's car, pushing it further along Rannapaloenk. The Ford Focus then came to a halt on the northeast corner of the intersection, sustaining front-end damage.

**Timeline of Events:**

- 08:30 - Mixed snow and rain begin, roads become slippery in Lemland.
- 08:32 - Mr. Koskinen's Volvo departs from 45 Kauppakatu heading east towards the intersection.
- 08:34 - Mr. Pitkänen's Corolla enters Rannapaloenk from the south, signaling a left turn onto Kauppakatu.
- 08:34:30 - Mr. Koskinen fails to come to a complete stop at the stop sign, colliding with Mr. Pitkänen's vehicle.
- 08:35 - Both vehicles spin out of control; Ford Focus driven by Ms. Lehtinen strikes the Volvo from the side.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The roads were wet with patches of slush due to ongoing mixed snow and rain, contributing to reduced traction and visibility. The slippery conditions likely played a significant role in the severity of the collisions, as all drivers involved reported difficulty maintaining control over their vehicles.

**Vehicle Damage:**

1. Volvo V60 (driven by Koskinen): Significant front-end damage, airbags deployed. License plate 34-LEM-12.
2. Toyota Corolla (driven by Pitkänen): Heavy damage to the passenger side, airbags deployed. License plate 78-LEM-90.
3. Ford Focus (driven by Lehtinen): Front-end collision damage. License plate 12-LEM-56.

**Witness Statements:**

Several pedestrians near the scene reported seeing Mr. Koskinen's vehicle approach the intersection without fully stopping, describing his car as traveling at a speed inconsistent with the stop sign requirement. Ms. Lehtinen stated she saw the impending collision but was unable to react in time due to the slippery conditions.

**Investigation Findings:**

Preliminary investigation suggests that driver negligence, specifically Mr. Koskinen's failure to obey the stop sign, was a primary contributing factor to this multi-vehicle accident. Weather conditions are noted as secondary but significant, impacting all drivers' abilities to maintain control of their vehicles.

This report is preliminary and subject to further investigation, including toxicology reports for alcohol and drug impairment, vehicle black box data analysis, and detailed forensic examination of the scene. Further updates will be provided as new information becomes available.
