**Traffic Incident Report**

*Incident Number:* 2024-ALV-008  
*Date of Incident:* 23 August 2024  
*Location:* Intersection of Kauppakatu and Ruotsalanpuro, Alavieska, Finland  
*Reporting Officer:* Inspector Jouko Mäkelä, Alavieska Police Department  

**Narrative:**

On the evening of 23 August 2024, at approximately 21:15 hours, a three-vehicle traffic incident occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ruotsalanpuro in Alavieska. The weather conditions were overcast, with reduced visibility due to dense cloud cover.

The primary vehicles involved were a silver 2023 Toyota Corolla, registered as '123-FIN-A', driven by Mr. Petteri Hietanen, 34, of Kauppakatu 56, Alavieska. Mr. Hietanen was proceeding northbound on Kauppakatu approaching the intersection.

Simultaneously, a dark blue 2022 Volvo S60, registered as '456-FIN-B', driven by Ms. Anna-Liisa Koskinen, 29, of Ruotsalanpuro 18, Alavieska, was traveling eastbound on Ruotsalanpuro intending to turn left onto Kauppakatu.

A third vehicle, a white 2021 Ford Focus, registered as '789-FIN-C', driven by Mr. Jussi Pekkarinen, 45, of Kauppakatu 32, Alavieska, was following the Toyota Corolla on Kauppakatu.

As Ms. Koskinen initiated her left turn, she failed to yield to oncoming traffic. The Volvo S60 collided with the driver's side of the Toyota Corolla, pushing it into the path of the Ford Focus. The Ford Focus, unable to stop in time, struck the rear of the Toyota Corolla.

**Timeline of Events:**

- 21:14: Ms. Koskinen signals intent to turn left from Ruotsalanpuro onto Kauppakatu.
- 21:14: Mr. Hietanen, in the Toyota Corolla, continues northbound on Kauppakatu at approximately 50 km/h.
- 21:14: Mr. Pekkarinen, in the Ford Focus, follows Mr. Hietanen, maintaining a safe following distance.
- 21:15: Ms. Koskinen begins her left turn without ensuring it is clear, directly into the path of the oncoming Toyota Corolla.
- 21:15: Collision occurs between Volvo S60 and Toyota Corolla; Mr. Hietanen loses control, veering slightly right.
- 21:15: Ford Focus, driven by Mr. Pekkarinen, collides with the rear of the Toyota Corolla.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The overcast weather contributed to reduced visibility, which may have impaired Ms. Koskinen's ability to accurately assess oncoming traffic. The road surface was damp due to recent light rainfall, increasing the risk of skidding and reducing tire grip.

**Vehicle Damage:**

- Toyota Corolla (123-FIN-A): Significant damage to the passenger side, including a crumpled front fender, damaged door, and a bent passenger-side headlight. Airbag deployment noted.
- Volvo S60 (456-FIN-B): Front-end damage, primarily affecting the driver's side, with a dented hood and scrapes along the front bumper.
- Ford Focus (789-FIN-C): Rear-end damage, evidenced by a crushed boot lid and minor paint transfer from the Corolla.

**Witnesses:**

Two pedestrians, Ms. Maria Sipilä and Mr. Olli Virtanen, witnessed the incident from adjacent properties on Kauppakatu and provided statements confirming the sequence of events and vehicle movements.

**Actions Taken:**

Emergency services were promptly dispatched to the scene. The injured parties—Mr. Hietanen (minor injuries) and an unnamed passenger in the Corolla (moderate injuries)—were transported to Alavieska Central Hospital for treatment. No fatalities were reported.

The road was cleared and reopened by 23:00 hours following thorough investigation and evidence collection. All drivers were issued citations for traffic violations where applicable, notably Ms. Koskinen for failure to yield. Further investigation into potential contributing factors, such as driver distraction or fatigue, is ongoing.
