**Timeline of Events:**

- **10:10 AM**: Driver A, Mikael Kivinen, proceeded northbound on Kauppakatu towards the intersection intending to turn right onto Ratinauksenkatu.
- **10:12 AM**: Driver B, Anna-Liisa Rantala, was traveling southbound on Kauppakatu and approaching the same intersection. She was in the lane intended for vehicles continuing straight through.
- **10:14 AM**: Driver C, Jussi Pekkarinen, was following behind Driver B in the same southbound lane on Kauppakatu, maintaining a safe distance.
- **10:15 AM**: As Driver A initiated his right turn, Driver B, who was not slowing down as expected, collided with the passenger side of Driver A's vehicle (Toyota Corolla). The impact caused Driver A’s vehicle to drift into the path of Driver C.
- **10:15 AM**: Driver C, upon seeing the collision unfold, attempted to brake but was unable to avoid a subsequent impact with Driver A’s vehicle. His Volkswagen Golf struck the rear passenger side of the Corolla.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The weather on the day of the incident was clear and sunny, with no precipitation or obscured visibility. The roads were dry, providing good traction for vehicles. However, the bright sunlight may have contributed to temporary glare conditions, potentially affecting Driver B's perception as she approached the intersection.

**Vehicle Damage:**

- **Toyota Corolla (Driver A)**: Significant damage was observed on the passenger side, including a dented door, shattered window, and scrapes along the side panel. Airbag deployment was noted.
- **Ford Focus (Driver B)**: Front-end damage was evident, with a crumpled hood and minor front bumper damage.
- **Volkswagen Golf (Driver C)**: Rear passenger-side damage included a dented door and scrapes along the rear panel. No airbag deployment was reported.

**Witnesses:**

Two pedestrians, Liisa Koskinen and Teppo Lehtinen, witnessed the incident from adjacent sidewalks. They provided statements confirming Driver B's failure to reduce speed before the collision and described the sequence of events leading up to the accident.

**Investigation Findings:**

Preliminary investigation suggests that Driver B was distracted, possibly due to a mobile device, leading to her inattention and failure to yield right-of-way to Driver A. Road conditions were clear, and no mechanical failures were identified in any of the vehicles involved.

This report is submitted for further action as deemed necessary by the Pälkäne Police Department. Further investigation, including potential charges against Driver B for negligent driving, will be pursued.
