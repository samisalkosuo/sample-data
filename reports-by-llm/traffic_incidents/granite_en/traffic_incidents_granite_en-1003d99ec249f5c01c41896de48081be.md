*Incident Number:* 2024-KIN-003  
*Date of Incident:* 21 March 2024  
*Location:* Intersection of Pohjoiskari and Keskusvuori Streets, Kinnula, Finland  
*Reporting Officer:* Inspector Jouko Hietala, Kinnula Police Department  

**Narrative:**

On the morning of 21 March 2024, at approximately 08:45, a three-vehicle traffic incident occurred at the intersection of Pohjoiskari and Keskusvuori Streets in Kinnula. The vehicles involved were a white 2019 Toyota Corolla, registered as FIN-123A, driven by Mr. Mikko Koskinen, 45, of Pohjoiskari 23, Kinnula; a grey 2020 Ford Focus, registered as FIN-456B, operated by Ms. Sanna Rantala, 31, residing at Keskusvuori 19, Kinnula; and a black 2018 Volvo V60, identified with registration FIN-789C, driven by Mr. Jari Pitkänen, 52, from Vuorinenpuro 4, Kinnula.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **08:38**: Ms. Rantala, driving the Ford Focus, approached the intersection from the north on Keskusvuori Street. Visibility was significantly reduced due to dense fog rolling in from the nearby lake.

- **08:40**: Mr. Koskinen, at the stop sign on Pohjoiskari Street, prepared to proceed into the intersection. He reported seeing Ms. Rantala's vehicle but noted that due to the foggy conditions, he could not accurately gauge her speed or distance.

- **08:42**: Mr. Pitkänen, driving south on Pohjoiskari Street in his Volvo, was following behind Koskinen’s Corolla. He stated that he noticed the Ford Focus entering the intersection but misjudged its speed due to the poor visibility caused by fog.

- **08:43**: The Ford Focus, driven by Ms. Rantala, collided with the front passenger side of Mr. Koskinen's Toyota Corolla as she attempted to navigate through the intersection. Simultaneously, Mr. Pitkänen, unable to react in time due to the reduced visibility, struck the rear of Ms. Rantala’s Ford Focus.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The incident occurred under foggy conditions with limited visibility, approximately 100 meters, as reported by local weather stations. The roads were dry but the dense fog impaired drivers' ability to perceive and react to other vehicles accurately.

**Vehicle Damages:**

- The Toyota Corolla sustained damage primarily to its passenger side front, including a dented door and scratches along the side panel.

- The Ford Focus received significant rear-end damage, affecting both the trunk and the rear bumper, with visible paint transfer from the collision with Mr. Pitkänen's Volvo.

- The Volvo V60 showed front-end damage, including a crumpled hood and minor cosmetic scratches on its front grille, indicative of the impact with Ms. Rantala’s vehicle.

**Witness Statements:**

A passerby, Mr. Olli Mäkelä, walking his dog along Pohjoiskari Street, confirmed witnessing the sequence of events and corroborated the drivers' accounts regarding the fog's impact on visibility.

**Conclusion:**

The incident was primarily caused by adverse weather conditions—dense fog—which severely compromised driver visibility, leading to misjudgments in speed and distance. All drivers involved were cooperative during the investigation, and no citations were issued given the mitigating factor of the challenging weather. Recommendations for improved road signage and potential installation of fog lights at this intersection are being considered by local authorities to enhance safety under similar conditions in the future.
