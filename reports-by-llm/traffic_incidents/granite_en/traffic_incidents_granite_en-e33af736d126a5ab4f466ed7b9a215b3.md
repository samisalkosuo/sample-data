**Traffic Incident Report**

*Incident Number:* 2025-PET-007  
*Date of Incident:* 16th July 2025  
*Location:* Intersection of Kauppakatu and Ratinkatu, Petäjävesi, Finland  
*Reporting Officer:* Inspector Jari Hietala  
*Municipality:* Petäjävesi  

**Narrative:**

On the evening of 16th July 2025, at approximately 18:30 hours, a two-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ratinkatu in Petäjävesi, Finland. The incident involved a grey 2019 Toyota Corolla, registered with the license plate '234-FIN-A', driven by Mr. Mikko Koskinen, a 35-year-old local resident of 12 Kauppakatu, and a silver 2020 Ford Focus, registered with the license plate '567-FIN-B', operated by Ms. Anna Pitkänen, a 28-year-old residing at 34 Ratinkatu.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **18:20 hours:** Ms. Pitkänen was driving westbound on Kauppakatu towards the intersection with Ratinkatu. Mr. Koskinen, proceeding eastbound on Kauppakatu, was preparing to turn left onto Ratinkatu.
- **18:25 hours:** As Ms. Pitkänen approached the intersection, she reduced her speed in compliance with the posted limit of 40 km/h due to the approaching thunderstorm, which had begun to drench the area, reducing visibility and causing wet road conditions.
- **18:28 hours:** Mr. Koskinen initiated his left turn without yielding to oncoming traffic, misjudging the distance and speed of Ms. Pitkänen's vehicle. The front passenger side of the Corolla collided with the driver’s side front of the Focus.
- **18:29 hours:** Both drivers brought their vehicles to a stop. A passerby, Mr. Jussi Rantala from nearby 56 Kauppakatu, witnessed the incident and immediately contacted emergency services at 18:30 hours.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The thunderstorm, characterized by heavy rainfall and reduced visibility, played a significant role in this incident. The wet roads contributed to decreased traction, potentially affecting both drivers' ability to maintain control of their vehicles.

**Vehicle Damages:**

- The Toyota Corolla sustained damage primarily to its front passenger side, including a dented fender and scratches along the side panel. The airbag deployed during the collision.
- The Ford Focus incurred damage to its driver's side front, with a crumpled hood and door, indicating significant impact force.

**Witness Statements:**

Mr. Rantala confirmed seeing Mr. Koskinen initiate his turn without checking for oncoming traffic and described Ms. Pitkänen as having applied her brakes but not soon enough to avoid the collision given the reduced visibility and road conditions.

**Conclusion:**

The collision was primarily caused by driver error, specifically Mr. Koskinen's failure to yield while making a left turn. Weather conditions exacerbated the situation by reducing visibility and increasing road slipperiness, though they did not directly cause the accident. Both drivers were transported to Petäjävesi Central Hospital for precautionary checks and released with minor injuries. No further action is being taken against either driver at this time, but both have been advised to review safe driving practices under adverse weather conditions.
