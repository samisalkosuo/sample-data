**Incident Details:**

*Date of Incident:* 18th March, 2025  
*Location:* Keitele, Finland  
*Time of Day:* Morning  
*Weather Conditions:* Dry but cold  

**Incident Description:**

On the morning of 18th March, 2025, at approximately 09:15 hours, a two-vehicle collision occurred on Kauppakatu Street in Keitele, Finland. The incident involved a silver 2018 Toyota Corolla, registered with the license plate '123 ABC', driven by Mr. Jari Mäki, a local resident of address 12 Kauppakatu, and a blue 2020 Ford Focus, bearing the license plate '456 DEF', operated by Ms. Anna Pitkänen from address 34 Kauppakatu.

**Narrative:**

According to witness statements and preliminary investigations, Mr. Mäki was traveling eastbound on Kauppakatu Street towards the town center. Ms. Pitkänen was proceeding westbound in the opposite direction. As both drivers approached the intersection with Linnunrata, a side street perpendicular to Kauppakatu, Mr. Mäki's vehicle reportedly drifted slightly into the oncoming lane due to what appears to be momentary distraction, possibly caused by adjusting his radio.

Ms. Pitkänen, noticing the approaching danger, attempted to avoid a collision by steering her Ford Focus towards the curb but was unable to prevent the impact entirely. The right front of Ms. Pitkänen's vehicle collided with the left side of Mr. Mäki’s Toyota Corolla. Both vehicles sustained damage, primarily to their passenger sides.

**Timeline of Events:**

- 09:10 hours: Both drivers depart from their respective residences and begin their commutes along Kauppakatu Street.
- 09:13 hours: Mr. Mäki adjusts his vehicle's radio, momentarily diverting his attention from the road ahead.
- 09:14 hours: Ms. Pitkänen observes Mr. Mäki’s vehicle drifting into her lane and initiates evasive maneuvers.
- 09:15 hours: Collision occurs at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Linnunrata, with both vehicles coming to a stop.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The morning was clear and dry, with temperatures around -2°C. Although there were no adverse weather conditions such as rain or ice, the cold temperatures may have contributed to reduced road surface friction, potentially affecting vehicle handling and braking distances.

**Damage Assessment:**

Mr. Mäki's Toyota Corolla sustained damage to its left passenger side, including a dented door and scratches along the side panel. Ms. Pitkänen’s Ford Focus showed corresponding damage on its right passenger side, with a crumpled fender and paint transfer indicating the point of impact.

**Witnesses:**

Two pedestrians, Mr. Petteri Koskinen and Ms. Laura Hietanen, who were walking their dogs in the vicinity, witnessed the incident and provided statements corroborating the above narrative.

**Investigation Status:**

The involved parties have been notified, and preliminary investigations are ongoing to determine contributing factors, including potential distraction as a cause for Mr. Mäki's momentary lane deviation. Further examination of vehicle event data recorders (black boxes) is planned to provide additional insights into the sequence of events leading up to the collision.
