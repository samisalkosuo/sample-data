**Narrative:**

On the evening of 18th November 2023, at approximately 21:45 hours, a three-vehicle traffic incident occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Rannikontie in the municipality of Liminka, Finland. The weather conditions were described as foggy, with reduced visibility affecting driver perception.

The vehicles involved were a silver 2019 Toyota Corolla, registered KY-12345, driven by Mr. Mikko Koskinen, 34, of Kauppakatu 12, Liminka; a blue 2020 Ford Focus, identified by license plate number LI-67890, operated by Ms. Sanna Pietilä, 28, residing at Rannikontie 45, Liminka; and a white 2017 Volvo V60, bearing the plates VO-23456, driven by Mr. Jussi Laine, 42, from Vuokatti, Finland, who was passing through Liminka.

According to witness statements and on-scene evidence, Ms. Pietilä was traveling southbound on Rannikontie approaching the intersection with Kauppakatu. Mr. Koskinen, proceeding westbound on Kauppakatu, failed to yield the right of way at the stop sign, entering the intersection in front of Ms. Pietilä's vehicle. Simultaneously, Mr. Laine, driving eastbound on Kauppakatu, attempted to navigate through the fog but was unable to avoid a collision with Mr. Koskinen’s vehicle due to its unexpected entry into his path.

The impact caused significant damage to all three vehicles. The Toyota Corolla sustained front-end damage, including a collapsed front bumper and hood intrusion. The Ford Focus received side panel damage, with the passenger door being crushed against the vehicle's frame. The Volvo V60 suffered substantial rear-end damage, affecting its trunk and rear light assembly.

Fortunately, no serious injuries were reported among the drivers or passengers involved. Mr. Koskinen and his passenger, Ms. Anna Hietala, 32, sustained minor cuts and bruises from the seatbelt restraint. Similarly, Ms. Pietilä and her passenger, Mr. Olli Mäkelä, 26, experienced minor whiplash symptoms. Mr. Laine was uninjured but shaken by the incident.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **21:35 hours:** Fog begins to descend over Liminka, reducing visibility significantly.
- **21:40 hours:** Ms. Pietilä departs from Rannikontie heading south towards Kauppakatu intersection.
- **21:42 hours:** Mr. Koskinen, in his Toyota Corolla, approaches the stop sign at Kauppakatu without coming to a complete stop, preparing to proceed westbound.
- **21:43 hours:** Ms. Pietilä enters the intersection, noticing Koskinen's vehicle suddenly entering her path due to poor visibility. She attempts evasive maneuvers but collides with the Corolla.
- **21:43 hours (approximately):** Mr. Laine, driving eastbound on Kauppakatu, encounters the initial collision and swerves to avoid impact, colliding instead with the rear of Ms. Pietilä's Ford Focus.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The foggy conditions played a critical role in this incident, obscuring visibility and contributing to Mr. Koskinen’s failure to yield properly at the stop sign. While there were no reported road hazards, the reduced visibility significantly impacted driver decision-making and reaction times.
