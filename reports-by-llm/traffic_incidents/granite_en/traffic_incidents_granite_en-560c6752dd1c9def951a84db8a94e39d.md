**Traffic Incident Report**

*Incident Number:* 230218-FIN-YL-001  
*Date of Incident:* 18 February 2023  
*Location:* Intersection of Kauppakatu and Metsäntie, Ylitornio, Finland  
*Reporting Officer:* Inspector Jouko Hietala, Ylitornio Police Department  

**Narrative:**

On the evening of 18 February 2023, at approximately 21:45 hours, a three-vehicle traffic incident occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Metsäntie in Ylitornio, Finland. The weather conditions were snowy, with light snowfall reducing visibility and creating slippery road surfaces.

The vehicles involved were operated by the following individuals:

1. **Driver A:** Jari Koskinen, 34, a local resident of Metsäntie 23, driving a silver 2018 Toyota Corolla with Finnish license plate 92-ABC.
2. **Driver B:** Anna Pitkänen, 27, residing at Kauppakatu 15, operating a blue 2020 Ford Focus with Finnish license plate 34-DEF.
3. **Driver C:** Olli Mäkelä, 58, from Hietanpuro 4, in control of a white 2016 Volvo V60 with Finnish license plate 78-GHI.

**Timeline of Events:**

- At approximately 21:40 hours, Driver A was traveling southbound on Metsäntie approaching the intersection with Kauppakatu.
- Driver B was proceeding westbound on Kauppakatu, intending to turn left (northbound) onto Metsäntie.
- Driver C was heading northbound on Metsäntie, approaching the same intersection from the opposite direction.

As Driver B initiated her left turn, she failed to yield to oncoming traffic, colliding with Driver A's Toyota Corolla. The impact caused Driver A's vehicle to spin, coming to a rest facing westbound on Kauppakatu. Simultaneously, the force of the collision propelled Driver C's Volvo into a snow-covered embankment on the northeastern corner of the intersection.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The roads were covered with a light layer of fresh snow, reducing traction and visibility. The snowfall, combined with reduced speed limits in residential areas due to the weather, contributed to the severity of the collision.

**Vehicle Damage:**

- **Toyota Corolla (Driver A):** Sustained significant damage to the passenger side, including a crumpled front fender and door. Airbags deployed, indicating a moderate impact.
- **Ford Focus (Driver B):** Front end sustained heavy damage, with the hood caved in and windshield shattered. The vehicle was disabled at the scene.
- **Volvo V60 (Driver C):** Experienced substantial damage to the driver's side, including a bent door and dented fender. The vehicle was able to be driven from the scene after being cleared by officers.

**Witnesses:**

Two passersby, Marko Lehtinen and Sanna Rantanen, provided statements confirming they witnessed Driver B's failure to yield and the ensuing collisions. They also reported that all drivers appeared alert and cooperative post-incident.

**Actions Taken:**

Emergency services were promptly dispatched, arriving on scene within 10 minutes. All parties involved were checked for injuries; none were found to be seriously harmed, though Driver B was transported to Ylitornio Central Hospital as a precaution due to minor whiplash.

The intersection was temporarily closed for investigation and cleanup, reopening at 23:00 hours. All vehicles were towed, and the scene was cleared by 23:30 hours.

This report is submitted for further investigation and insurance claims processing. Further inquiries should be directed to Inspector Jouko Hietala at the Ylitornio Police Department.
