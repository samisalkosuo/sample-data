**Traffic Incident Report**

*Incident Number:* 2024-LAP-00678  
*Date of Incident:* 30th June 2024  
*Location:* Intersection of Kauppakatu and Ratinauksenkatu, Lapua, Finland  
*Reporting Officer:* Inspector Jari Hietala

**Narrative:**

On the evening of 30th June 2024, at approximately 18:15 hours, a two-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ratinauksenkatu in the municipality of Lapua, Finland. The incident involved a white 2019 Toyota Corolla, registered with the license plate '345-LK', driven by Mr. Mikko Kivinen, a 38-year-old local resident of Kauppakatu 12, and a grey 2020 Ford Focus, registered with the license plate '789-LA', operated by Ms. Anna Pietilä, a 25-year-old residing at Ratinauksenkatu 36.

**Timeline of Events:**

1. **18:00 - 18:10 hours:** Both vehicles were traveling within the speed limits on their respective roads leading to the intersection. The weather conditions were snowy, with light snowfall reducing visibility and creating slippery road surfaces.

2. **18:10 - 18:15 hours:** Mr. Kivinen, approaching the intersection from the north on Kauppakatu, proceeded to stop at the stop sign as per traffic regulations. Ms. Pietilä, driving south on Ratinauksenkatu, maintained a steady speed but encountered reduced traction due to the snowy conditions, causing her vehicle to slide slightly towards the intersection.

3. **18:15 hours:** As Ms. Pietilä's Ford Focus entered the intersection, it collided with the front passenger side of Mr. Kivinen's Toyota Corolla, which was in the process of crossing from a complete stop. The impact caused significant damage to both vehicles—the Corolla sustained substantial front-end damage, including a crumpled hood and headlight, while the Focus incurred damage to its passenger side door and rear quarter panel.

**Witnesses:**

Two pedestrians, Mr. Jussi Rantala and Ms. Laura Mäkelä, who were walking their dogs in adjacent parks, witnessed the incident. They provided statements confirming that both drivers attempted to apply brakes but were unable to avoid the collision due to the adverse weather conditions.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The snowfall, though light, combined with the cold temperatures, resulted in icy patches on the road surface, contributing to reduced traction for both vehicles. Visibility was moderately impaired by falling snow, which may have affected drivers' ability to perceive each other's approach accurately.

**Damage Descriptions:**

- **Toyota Corolla (345-LK):** Front passenger side suffered severe structural damage, including a bent frame and shattered headlight. The airbags deployed during the impact.

- **Ford Focus (789-LA):** Passenger side door was dented, and there was significant damage to the rear quarter panel, suggesting a glancing blow from the Corolla.

**Conclusion:**

The collision appears to have resulted primarily from the challenging weather conditions and the drivers' attempts to navigate safely within those constraints. No immediate evidence suggests driver negligence beyond the inherent difficulties posed by the snowy roads. Both drivers were transported to the nearest hospital for routine checks and released with no reported injuries.

This report is submitted for further investigation and insurance claims processing as deemed necessary. Further analysis of vehicle data recorders (black boxes) has been initiated to corroborate witness statements and provide additional insights into the events leading up to the collision.
