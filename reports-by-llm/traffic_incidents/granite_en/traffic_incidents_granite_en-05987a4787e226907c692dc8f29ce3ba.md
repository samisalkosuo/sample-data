**Traffic Incident Report**

*Incident Number:* 2025-POS-001  
*Date of Incident:* 15th June 2025  
*Location:* Intersection of Kauppakatu and Ratinpellinkangas, Posio, Finland  
*Reporting Officer:* Inspector Jari Hämäläinen  

**Narrative:**

On the evening of 15th June 2025, at approximately 18:30 hours, a two-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ratinpellinkangas in Posio, Finland. The incident involved a grey 2019 Toyota Corolla, registered with the license plate '234-FIN-A', driven by Mr. Mikko Koskinen, a 35-year-old local resident, and a silver 2020 Ford Focus, identified by its license plate '567-FIN-B', operated by Ms. Sanna Pitkänen, a 28-year-old residing in the neighbouring municipality of Enonbay.

**Timeline of Events:**

1. **18:20 hours**: Ms. Pitkänen was travelling eastbound on Kauppakatu towards the intersection with Ratinpellinkangas, intending to turn left (northbound). Mr. Koskinen was proceeding westbound on Kauppakatu, heading in the opposite direction.

2. **18:25 hours**: As Ms. Pitkänen approached the intersection, she activated her left-turn signal. A witness, Mr. Jussi Rantala, who was driving a nearby bus and stopped at the bus stop near the intersection, noted that Ms. Pitkänen checked for oncoming traffic but proceeded into the turn when it appeared safe.

3. **18:28 hours**: Mr. Koskinen, travelling at an estimated speed of 40 km/h in a 50 km/h zone, continued straight through the intersection without reducing his speed significantly, despite heavy rainfall reducing visibility and grip on the road surface.

4. **18:29 hours**: The Ford Focus, driven by Ms. Pitkänen, was struck on its passenger side by the Toyota Corolla as she attempted her left turn. The impact caused both vehicles to collide, with the Corolla spinning and coming to a stop facing westbound against the curb on the southern side of Kauppakatu.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

Heavy rain was falling throughout the incident, significantly impairing visibility. The road surface was wet, leading to reduced traction for both vehicles. No skid marks were found at the scene, suggesting that neither driver managed to apply their brakes effectively before impact due to the slippery conditions.

**Vehicle Damage:**

The Toyota Corolla sustained damage primarily to its front passenger side, including a dented door and a broken headlight. The Ford Focus incurred damage to its passenger side, with a crumpled rear panel and a damaged tail light. Both airbags deployed in the Corolla, indicating the severity of the impact on that vehicle's occupants.

**Witnesses:**

Mr. Jussi Rantala, a local bus driver, provided a statement confirming Ms. Pitkänen's adherence to traffic signals and her cautious approach to making the turn. He also noted Mr. Koskinen’s speed and lack of manoeuvre to avoid the collision despite having ample time to react.

**Summary:**

The collision appears to have resulted from a combination of factors, including heavy rain impeding visibility and vehicle control, and Mr. Koskinen's failure to reduce speed appropriately in poor weather conditions. Ms. Pitkänen followed standard procedures for making a left turn but was unable to avoid the oncoming Corolla due to its excessive speed. Both drivers were transported to the nearest hospital for assessment of minor injuries, and no further individuals were involved or reported missing as passengers.
