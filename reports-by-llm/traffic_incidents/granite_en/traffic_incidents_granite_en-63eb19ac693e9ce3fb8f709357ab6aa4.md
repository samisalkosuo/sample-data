**Narrative:**

On the evening of 27th November 2024, at approximately 18:30 hours, a multi-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ratinauksenranta in Ylivieska, Finland. The incident involved a total of eleven vehicles, resulting in various degrees of damage and minor injuries to the drivers and passengers.

The primary vehicle involved was a 2019 Volvo V60, registered with the license plate 345-YV, driven by Mr. Mikko Hietala, a local resident of Kauppakatu 23. Mr. Hietala was proceeding eastbound on Kauppakatu towards Ratinauksenranta. As he approached the intersection, he reportedly failed to fully stop at the stop sign due to wet and slippery road conditions caused by recent rainfall.

Concurrently, a 2020 Toyota Corolla, bearing license plate number 789-YV, driven by Ms. Anna Koskinen from Ratinauksenranta 12, was traveling southbound on Ratinauksenranta. She reportedly had a green light as she entered the intersection. The collision occurred when Mr. Hietala's vehicle struck the passenger side of Ms. Koskinen's car, subsequently causing a chain reaction involving other vehicles waiting at the red light on Kauppakatu.

Witnesses, including Mr. Jussi Rantanen and Ms. Laura M채kel채 from nearby residences on Kauppakatu, provided statements confirming that Mr. Hietala's vehicle did not come to a complete stop before entering the intersection. They also noted the slippery road conditions, which were exacerbated by standing water and reduced visibility due to the evening's dim lighting.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The prevailing weather conditions at the time of the incident were wet with slippery roads due to recent rainfall.

**Conclusion:**

The incident was primarily caused by Mr. Hietala's failure to adhere to traffic signals under hazardous weather conditions. All parties involved were cooperative during the investigation, and no criminal charges were filed. However, Mr. Hietala received a traffic violation for failing to stop at a stop sign.

This report is submitted for further review and consideration in any subsequent legal or insurance proceedings related to this incident.
