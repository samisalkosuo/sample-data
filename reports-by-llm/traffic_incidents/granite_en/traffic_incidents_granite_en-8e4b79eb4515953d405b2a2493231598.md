**Narrative:**

On the evening of 16th March 2025, at approximately 21:45 hours, a two-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Onerva Street and Kalevägen in Varkaus. The incident involved a grey 2018 Toyota Corolla, registered with the license plate '3456-VA', driven by Mr. Mikko Koskinen, a 32-year-old local resident of Onerva 23, and a silver 2020 Ford Focus, bearing the license plate '7890-VA', operated by Ms. Anna Pitkänen, a 27-year-old residing at Kalevägen 15.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **21:40 hours:** Ms. Pitkänen was driving southbound on Onerva Street towards the intersection with Kalevägen. Mr. Koskinen, approaching from the east on Kalevägen, prepared to turn left onto Onerva Street.

- **21:42 hours:** As Ms. Pitkänen entered the intersection, she reportedly lost control of her vehicle due to wet and slippery road conditions. The Focus skidded into the intersection, colliding with Mr. Koskinen's Corolla, which was in the process of making a left turn.

- **21:43 hours:** Both vehicles came to an immediate stop after the impact, partially blocking the intersection. 

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The weather on the night of the incident was described as wet with slippery road surfaces by several witnesses, including Mr. Jari Lehtinen, who was driving northbound on Onerva Street and stopped to assist. The Finnish Meteorological Institute's records confirm a light rainfall in Varkaus during this period, contributing to the hazardous conditions.

**Vehicle Damage:**

The Toyota Corolla sustained damage primarily to its front passenger side, including a dented fender and scratches along the door. The Ford Focus incurred significant damage to its front driver's side, with a crumpled hood and a broken headlight. Both vehicles were towed from the scene for further examination and repair.

**Witnesses:**

Mr. Jari Lehtinen, a 45-year-old engineer residing at Länsiväylä 45, provided a statement confirming the slippery conditions and his observation of both vehicles losing control prior to the collision. Ms. Sanna Rantanen, a 22-year-old student living nearby, also witnessed the incident from her apartment balcony and corroborated the sequence of events.

**Conclusion:**

The collision appears to have resulted primarily from adverse weather conditions exacerbating driver error. Both drivers were transported to Varkaus Central Hospital for precautionary checks, with no reported serious injuries. Further investigation into potential speeding or other contributing factors is ongoing.
