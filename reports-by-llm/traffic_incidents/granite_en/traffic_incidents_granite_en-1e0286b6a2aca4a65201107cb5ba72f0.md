*Date of Incident:* 20 February 2025  
*Location:* Intersection of Kauppakatu and Ratinauksenranta, Tervola, Finland  
*Reporting Officer:* Inspector Jouko Hietala, Tervola Police Department  

**Narrative:**

On the morning of 20 February 2025, at approximately 09:15, a three-vehicle traffic incident occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ratinauksenranta in Tervola, Finland. The drivers involved were identified as Mikko Koskinen, a local baker residing at 23 Kauppakatu; Anna Pitkänen, a school teacher from 45 Ratinauksenranta; and Olli Mäkelä, a carpenter living at 102 Kauppakatu.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **09:08**: Anna Pitkänen, driving her 2018 Toyota Corolla (license plate 3456-FIN) eastbound on Kauppakatu, approached the intersection with Ratinauksenranta. The weather at this time was overcast with intermittent rain, typical of an approaching thunderstorm.

- **09:10**: Mikko Koskinen, operating his 2015 Ford Focus (license plate 7890-FIN), proceeded westbound on Kauppakatu, intending to turn left onto Ratinauksenranta. He was distracted by a mobile phone call and failed to notice the stop sign.

- **09:12**: Olli Mäkelä, driving his 2020 Volvo V60 (license plate 1234-FIN), traveled southbound on Ratinauksenranta towards Kauppakatu. He maintained a lawful speed but was unable to avoid the collision due to the sudden intrusion of Mikko Koskinen's vehicle.

- **09:15**: Mikko Koskinen's Ford Focus collided with Anna Pitkänen's Toyota Corolla at the intersection, pushing it sideways into Olli Mäkelä's Volvo V60. All vehicles sustained damages; the front of Koskinen’s car was crumpled, the passenger side of Pitkänen's car was heavily dented, and the rear of Mäkelä's vehicle showed significant impact marks.

**Witnesses:**

Two pedestrians, Liisa Rantala (age 32) and Jari Kivinen (age 45), witnessed the incident from a nearby café. They reported that the thunderstorm began to intensify with heavy rain and lightning shortly after the collision, which may have affected visibility.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The thunderstorm, characterized by heavy rain and reduced visibility, was a contributing factor to the incident. The wet road surface compounded the difficulty of maintaining control for the drivers involved, particularly Mikko Koskinen who was distracted at the critical moment.

**Damages:**

- Mikko Koskinen's Ford Focus: Front-end damage, airbag deployment, and minor injuries to Koskinen (treated on-site).
- Anna Pitkänen's Toyota Corolla: Passenger side dented, airbag deployment, and minor injuries to Pitkänen (transported to Tervola Central Hospital for observation).
- Olli Mäkelä's Volvo V60: Rear-end impact, no airbag deployment, but shock from the sudden collision.

**Action Taken:**

The scene was secured, and all parties involved were accounted for. Emergency medical services transported the injured drivers to Tervola Central Hospital. Traffic was diverted, and road cleanup commenced following the investigation. Mikko Koskinen was issued a citation for failure to obey a stop sign.
