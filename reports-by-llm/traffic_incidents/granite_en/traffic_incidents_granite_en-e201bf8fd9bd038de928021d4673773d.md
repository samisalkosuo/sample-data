*Incident Number:* 230606-LOI-01  
*Date of Incident:* 06.06.2023  
*Location:* Intersection of Kauppakatu and Ratinkatu, Loimaa, Finland  
*Reporting Officer:* Inspector Jouko Hietala, Loimaa Police Department  

**Narrative:**

On the evening of 06.06.2023, at approximately 21:45 hours, a two-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ratinkatu in the municipality of Loimaa, Finland. The incident involved a grey 2018 Volvo V60, registered with the license plate 34-LOI-12, driven by Mr. Mikko Koskinen, a 35-year-old local resident, and a silver 2020 Toyota Corolla, identified by its license plate 78-LOI-91, operated by Ms. Anna Pitkänen, a 29-year-old resident of nearby Kangasala.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **21:40 hours:** Mr. Koskinen was traveling westbound on Kauppakatu approaching the intersection with Ratinkatu. Ms. Pitkänen was proceeding southbound on Ratinkatu, intending to turn left onto Kauppakatu.
- **21:42 hours:** As Mr. Koskinen entered the intersection, Ms. Pitkänen initiated her left turn without yielding to oncoming traffic, colliding with the passenger side of Mr. Koskinen's Volvo.
- **21:43 hours:** Both vehicles came to a stop at the northeast quadrant of the intersection. Immediately following the collision, several pedestrians, including Ms. Liisa Rantanen and Mr. Jussi Mäkelä, who were walking home from nearby shops, approached to render assistance.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The night was clear with a temperature of 8°C, under dry but cold conditions typical for the region during this time of year. The roads were well-maintained, with no reported obstructions or hazards contributing to the incident. However, reduced visibility due to the darkness and the absence of streetlights at this specific intersection may have played a role in the failure to perceive each other's movements.

**Vehicle Damage:**

The Volvo V60 sustained significant damage to its passenger side, including a dented door, shattered side window, and scrapes along the vehicle’s side panel. The Toyota Corolla incurred damage to its front driver's side, with a bent hood, scratches on the bumper, and a broken headlight.

**Witness Statements:**

Ms. Rantanen and Mr. Mäkelä corroborated each other’s accounts, stating that Ms. Pitkänen's vehicle entered the intersection without pausing to check for westbound traffic, while Mr. Koskinen was clearly visible and in motion prior to the collision.

**Conclusion:**

The incident appears to be a result of a failure to yield right-of-way by Ms. Pitkänen, compounded by reduced visibility at night. No evidence suggests excessive speed or reckless driving on either party's part. Both drivers were transported to the local hospital for precautionary checks and released with no serious injuries reported.
