**Narrative:**

On the afternoon of 08.11.2022, at approximately 14:30 hours, a three-vehicle traffic incident occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ruotsalanmäki in the municipality of Kinnula, Finland. The vehicles involved were a grey 2018 Toyota Corolla, registered as FIN-1234, driven by Mr. Mikko Koskinen, 35, of Kauppakatu 12, Kinnula; a blue 2020 Ford Focus, registered as FIN-5678, operated by Ms. Sanna Pitkänen, 29, of Ruotsalanmäki 5, Kinnula; and a white 2015 Volvo V60, identified as FIN-9101, driven by Mr. Jussi Lehtinen, 42, of Kauppakatu 34, Kinnula.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **14:28 hours:** Ms. Pitkänen, driving the Ford Focus, approached the intersection from the west on Ruotsalanmäki, intending to turn left onto Kauppakatu. Mr. Koskinen, in the Corolla, was traveling southbound along Kauppakatu towards the same intersection.
- **14:29 hours:** Mr. Lehtinen, driving the Volvo, proceeded eastward on Ruotsalanmäki, heading towards the intersection with intent to turn right onto Kauppakatu.
- **14:30 hours:** As Ms. Pitkänen initiated her left turn, she lost traction due to wet and slippery road conditions. Her vehicle slid into the path of Mr. Lehtinen's Volvo, which was also experiencing reduced grip on the slick pavement. Despite braking, a collision ensued between the Ford Focus and the Volvo.
- **14:30 hours (continued):** The impact propelled the Ford Focus further into the intersection, where it collided with the Toyota Corolla driven by Mr. Koskinen, who was unable to avoid the chain reaction due to the sudden appearance of the other two vehicles in his path.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The prevailing weather conditions at the time of the incident were wet and slippery, with intermittent rainfall contributing to poor road grip. The roads were not treated with salt or grit, exacerbating the hazardous conditions.

**Vehicle Damage:**

- **Toyota Corolla (FIN-1234):** Sustained damage primarily to the front passenger side, including a dented door and scratches along the side panel. The airbag deployed during the collision.
- **Ford Focus (FIN-5678):** Experienced significant front-end damage, with the hood crumpled and headlight shattered. The vehicle also had scrapes on the driver's side.
- **Volvo V60 (FIN-9101):** Frontal impact resulted in a bent hood, damaged bumper, and misalignment of the front grille area.

**Witnesses:**

Two pedestrians, Ms. Anna Rautiainen and Mr. Olli Mäkelä, walking along Kauppakatu, witnessed the incident and provided statements corroborating the sequence of events. They noted the slippery conditions and the vehicles' reduced control prior to the collisions.

**Action Taken:**

Emergency services were promptly dispatched to the scene. The involved parties were transported to Kinnula Hospital for medical evaluation, with no reported life-threatening injuries. All vehicles were towed to a secure location for further investigation and repair. The road was temporarily closed for cleanup and investigation but reopened by 16:00 hours.

**Investigation Status:**

The investigation is ongoing to determine liability, with a focus on assessing each driver's adherence to traffic regulations under the given weather conditions. Additional analysis of vehicle data recorders (black boxes) has been initiated to supplement witness testimonies and physical evidence.
