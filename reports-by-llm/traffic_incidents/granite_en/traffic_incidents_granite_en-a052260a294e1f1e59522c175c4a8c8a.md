**Traffic Incident Report**

*Incident Number:* 23-KOL-0511  
*Date of Incident:* 11 May 2023  
*Location:* Intersection of Kaupincatu and Pohjolanpuu, Kontiolahti, Finland  
*Reporting Officer:* Inspector Jouko Hietala, Kontiolahti Police Department  

**Narrative:**

On the evening of 11 May 2023, at approximately 18:45 hours, a two-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kaupincatu and Pohjolanpuu in Kontiolahti, Finland. The incident involved a white 2019 Toyota Corolla, registered with the license plate 34-KOL-12, driven by Mr. Mikko Koskinen, a 35-year-old local resident of Pohjolanpuu 23, and a silver 2020 Ford Focus, registered with the license plate 78-KOL-91, operated by Ms. Anna Rautiainen, a 28-year-old resident of Kaupincatu 45.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **18:30 hours:** Ms. Rautiainen was driving eastbound on Kaupincatu towards the intersection with Pohjolanpuu, proceeding at a moderate speed in clear evening conditions.
- **18:32 hours:** Mr. Koskinen, approaching from the south on Pohjolanpuu, prepared to turn left onto Kaupincatu. He was unaware that Ms. Rautiainen's vehicle was nearing the intersection due to reduced visibility caused by the setting sun and icy road conditions.
- **18:34 hours:** As Mr. Koskinen initiated his left turn, Ms. Rautiainen's Ford Focus entered the intersection from his right, colliding with the passenger side of the Toyota Corolla. The impact caused both vehicles to come to a stop facing opposite directions on Kaupincatu and Pohjolanpuu, respectively.
- **18:35 hours:** A passing witness, Mr. Jari Lehtinen, who was traveling westbound on Kaupincatu, immediately pulled over to assist. He reported that both drivers appeared shaken but uninjured and that there were no passengers in either vehicle.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The evening of 11 May experienced clear skies transitioning into dusk, with reduced visibility due to the low sun angle. Icy road conditions, exacerbated by overnight freezing temperatures, contributed to the slippery surface, likely impairing traction for both drivers.

**Vehicle Damage:**

- The Toyota Corolla, driven by Mr. Koskinen, sustained damage primarily to its passenger side, including a dented door and scrapes along the side panel.
- The Ford Focus, operated by Ms. Rautiainen, showed impact marks on its front passenger quarter panel, suggesting a glancing blow during the collision.

**Witness Statements:**

Mr. Jari Lehtinen confirmed that both drivers appeared sober and cooperative. He also noted that neither driver used their horn prior to the collision, which might have provided additional warning in the challenging visibility conditions.

**Conclusion:**

The collision appears to be a result of misjudgment by Mr. Koskinen regarding Ms. Rautiainen's approach speed and distance, compounded by icy road conditions affecting vehicle control. No criminal negligence is suspected, but both drivers will be cited for failing to yield right-of-way appropriately under the given weather and visibility circumstances.
