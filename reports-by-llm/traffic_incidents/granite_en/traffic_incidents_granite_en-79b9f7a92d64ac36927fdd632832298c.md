*Incident Number:* 231130-JUU-001  
*Date of Incident:* 30th November 2023  
*Location:* Intersection of Kauppakatu and Rautatieasema, Juupajoki, Finland

**Narrative:**

On the evening of 30th November 2023, at approximately 21:45 hours, a three-vehicle traffic incident occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Rautatieasema in the municipality of Juupajoki, Finland. The weather conditions were foggy, significantly reducing visibility.

The primary vehicles involved were operated by the following individuals:

1. **Driver A:** Mikael Kaski, a 38-year-old local resident of Kauppakatu 23, was driving a 2019 Volvo V60 with Finnish license plate 123-AB-45 towards the town centre from the northern approach of the intersection.

2. **Driver B:** Anna Pitkänen, a 25-year-old student residing at Rautatieasema 56, was navigating her 2021 Toyota Corolla (license plate 678-XY-90) from the eastern approach, heading southbound towards the railway station.

3. **Driver C:** Olli Miettinen, a 45-year-old delivery driver from Kauppakatu 112, was operating his 2017 Ford Focus (license plate 345-EF-67) in the same direction as Driver A but from the southern approach, en route to drop off packages.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **21:40 hours:** All drivers approached the intersection under foggy conditions. Visibility was severely compromised, estimated at less than 50 meters.

- **21:43 hours:** Driver A entered the intersection from the northern approach, intending to turn left onto Rautatieasema. Due to reduced visibility, Driver A failed to perceive Driver B's approaching vehicle.

- **21:44 hours:** Driver B, proceeding with caution but hindered by fog, continued southbound on Rautatieasema. She was unaware of Driver A’s intent to turn left until it was too late to avoid a collision.

- **21:44 hours:** Simultaneously, Driver C, following closely behind Driver A, also failed to react in time to the sudden braking lights of Driver A's vehicle, resulting in a chain reaction collision.

**Impact of Weather Conditions:**

The foggy weather played a critical role in this incident. All drivers were operating under significantly reduced visibility, which impaired their ability to perceive and react to other vehicles in a timely manner. The lack of clear sightlines at the intersection contributed directly to the misjudgment of distances and speeds, leading to the collision.

**Vehicle Damage:**

- **Volvo V60 (Driver A):** Sustained substantial damage to the front passenger side, including a collapsed front fender and a dented door. Airbag deployment was noted, indicating occupant restraint.

- **Toyota Corolla (Driver B):** Experienced significant damage to the driver's side, with a crumpled front end and side panel. The airbag also deployed, suggesting passenger involvement.

- **Ford Focus (Driver C):** Received minor damage to the rear bumper, primarily from the impact with Driver A’s vehicle during the chain reaction. No airbag deployment was reported.

**Witnesses:**

Two pedestrians, Liisa and Jouko, who were walking their dog near the intersection, provided statements corroborating the described sequence of events. They noted the heavy fog and mentioned seeing flashing lights and hearing the sound of impacts before approaching cautiously to render assistance.

**Conclusion:**

This incident serves as a stark reminder of the dangers posed by adverse weather conditions, particularly fog, which can severely impair driver visibility and reaction times. All parties involved were within the confines of the speed limit, but the unpredictable nature of reduced visibility led to this unfortunate series of events. No serious injuries were reported, though all drivers and passengers were advised to seek medical evaluation as a precaution due to the impact forces.
