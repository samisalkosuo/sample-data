**Timeline of Events:**

- **23:42 hours:** Both drivers reportedly had green traffic signals, indicating right of way.

- **23:45 hours:** The collision occurred, resulting in moderate damage to both vehicles. Mr. Koskinen sustained minor injuries, while Ms. Pitkänen reported no apparent injuries.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

Heavy rain was falling throughout the incident period, reducing visibility and creating slippery road conditions. The intersection, lacking adequate drainage, had standing water, further complicating driver control and reaction times.

**Vehicle Details and Damage:**

- **Toyota Corolla (Finland License Plate 123-TO):** Sustained damage primarily to the passenger side, including a dented door, broken side mirror, and scratches along the paneling. Airbag deployment was noted, indicating occupant restraint during the impact.

**Investigation Status:**

The scene was secured, and evidence collected, including photographs, skid marks analysis, and CCTV footage review. Both drivers were administered preliminary breath tests, yielding negative results for alcohol impairment. Ms. Pitkänen admitted to momentarily checking her mobile device prior to entering the intersection, though she claimed to have done so safely.

The investigation is ongoing to determine potential contributing factors, including driver distraction and road maintenance issues due to the heavy rainfall. Further analysis will include environmental conditions and vehicle performance data retrieval if available.
