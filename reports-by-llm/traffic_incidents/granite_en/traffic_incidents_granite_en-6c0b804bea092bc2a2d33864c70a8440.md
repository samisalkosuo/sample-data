**Narrative:**

On the evening of 27th June 2025, at approximately 20:45 hrs, a multi-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ruotsalanpuro in Mänttä-Vilppula. The incident involved ten vehicles, resulting in various degrees of damage and minor injuries to the drivers and passengers.

The primary cause of the accident appears to be reduced visibility due to dense fog that enveloped the area during the late evening hours. At the time, the weather station recorded visibility at less than 100 meters, significantly impairing driver perception.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **20:30 hrs:** Fog began to descend over Mänttä-Vilppula, reducing visibility on major roads including Kauppakatu and Ruotsalanpuro.
- **20:40 hrs:** A group of five vehicles, traveling eastbound on Kauppakatu, approached the intersection with Ruotsalanpuro. The lead vehicle was a 2020 Toyota Corolla, registered as '123-MT-45', driven by Mr. Petteri Koskinen, 34, of Vilppula.
- **20:42 hrs:** Simultaneously, four vehicles were proceeding southbound on Ruotsalanpuro. Among them was a 2018 Volvo XC60, registered as '456-MV-78', driven by Ms. Anna-Liisa Pitkänen, 29, of Mänttä.
- **20:43 hrs:** Due to the severe fog conditions, Mr. Koskinen failed to perceive the stop sign at Ruotsalanpuro. His vehicle collided with Ms. Pitkänen's Volvo at an estimated speed of 45 km/h.
- **20:43-20:46 hrs:** The impact triggered a chain reaction, involving nine additional vehicles waiting or in motion at the intersection. Vehicles involved included a Ford Focus, Honda Civic, Nissan Qashqai, Audi A3, Mercedes-Benz C-Class, BMW 3 Series, Subaru Outback, Hyundai Tucson, and a Dacia Sandero.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The fog was described as 'dense' by witnesses, significantly reducing visibility to less than 50 meters. Road conditions were dry but slippery due to the accumulation of fine mist, contributing to the difficulty in maintaining control for drivers.

**Vehicle Damages:**

- Toyota Corolla (123-MT-45): Front-end damage, airbags deployed. Driver, Petteri Koskinen, sustained minor injuries.
- Volvo XC60 (456-MV-78): Heavy frontal impact, airbags deployed. Passenger, Liisa Pitkänen, sustained minor injuries.
- Ford Focus (789-MF-12), Honda Civic (321-HN-65), Nissan Qashqai (987-NQ-34): Minor rear-end collisions; all vehicles sustained cosmetic damage.
- Audi A3 (567-AV-90), BMW 3 Series (234-BM-56): Side impacts resulting in side panel and door damage.
- Mercedes-Benz C-Class (888-MC-21), Subaru Outback (654-SU-77), Hyundai Tucson (999-HT-32): Rear-end collisions causing minor damage to boot lids and rear bumpers.
- Dacia Sandero (111-DS-00): Minor frontal impact with a stationary vehicle, resulting in damage to the front bumper and hood.

**Witnesses:**

Several witnesses were present at nearby bus stops and residences, including Ms. Eeva Rantanen, who provided a detailed account of events, and Mr. Jussi Kivinen, a local shopkeeper who captured video footage of the incident using his CCTV system.

**Conclusion:**

The collision was primarily caused by reduced visibility due to fog, leading to a failure to perceive traffic signals. All drivers involved were cited for failing to exercise due care under adverse weather conditions. Emergency services responded promptly, and all injured parties received medical attention at the scene before being transported to the Mänttä Central Hospital for further evaluation.

This report is submitted for review and further action as deemed necessary by the Traffic Safety Department of Mänttä-Vilppula Police District.
