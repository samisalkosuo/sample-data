**Narrative:**

On the afternoon of 11 April 2023, at approximately 14:30 hours, a two-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Rannikko in the municipality of Luoto, Finland. The incident involved a white 2018 Toyota Corolla, registered with the license plate 123-ABC, driven by Mr. Mikko Kivinen, a local resident aged 45, and a silver 2020 Ford Focus, identified by its license plate number 456-DEF, operated by Ms. Sanna Pitkänen, a 32-year-old teacher from nearby Vaasa.

**Timeline of Events:**

1. **14:28 hours:** Mr. Kivinen, driving westbound on Kauppakatu towards the intersection, approached the stop sign. Ms. Pitkänen, traveling southbound on Rannikko, was also preparing to enter the intersection. Both drivers were within the speed limits for their respective roads under clear and sunny weather conditions.

2. **14:29 hours:** As Mr. Kivinen proceeded through the stop sign, Ms. Pitkänen, who may have misjudged the closing speed of the Corolla, continued her southward journey without fully stopping at the yield sign located on Rannikko before the intersection.

3. **14:30 hours:** The vehicles collided in the southwest quadrant of the intersection. The front passenger side of the Corolla struck the driver's side front of the Focus, resulting in moderate damage to both vehicles. 

**Witness Statements and Additional Information:**

- A passing cyclist, Mr. Olli Mäkelä, provided a witness account stating that Ms. Pitkänen appeared to have been distracted by her mobile phone just prior to the collision.
- No serious injuries were reported; both drivers and a passenger in the Corolla sustained minor cuts and bruises. They were transported to the nearby Luoto Health Center for precautionary checks.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The weather on the day of the incident was clear and sunny, with temperatures reaching a high of 12°C. The roads were dry, providing good traction, but the bright sunlight may have contributed to temporary glare conditions, potentially affecting visibility for drivers entering intersections.

**Vehicle Details:**

- **Toyota Corolla (Driver: Mikko Kivinen):** The vehicle sustained damage primarily to the front passenger side, including a dented fender and scratches along the side panel. Airbag deployment was noted, indicating a minor impact on the driver's seat.
  
- **Ford Focus (Driver: Sanna Pitkänen):** The Focus incurred damage to its front driver’s side, with a crumpled hood and a scraped headlight. The airbag also deployed, suggesting a moderate impact.

**Conclusion:**

The investigation suggests that the collision was primarily caused by Ms. Pitkänen's failure to yield at the stop sign on Rannikko, compounded by possible distraction from her mobile device use. Mr. Kivinen was found to be in compliance with traffic regulations and did not exhibit any signs of negligence or impairment. No citations were issued at the scene pending further review of Ms. Pitkänen's phone records to confirm distraction as a contributing factor.
