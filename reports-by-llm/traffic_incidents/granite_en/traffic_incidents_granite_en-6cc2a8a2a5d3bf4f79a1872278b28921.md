**Narrative:**

On the evening of 27th September 2023, at approximately 18:15 hours, a multi-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ratinauksenranta in the municipality of Geta, Finland. The incident involved four vehicles, resulting in minor injuries to the drivers and passengers.

The primary vehicles involved were:
1. A silver 2019 Toyota Corolla, registered KY-12345, driven by Mr. Mikko Koskinen, a local resident of Kauppakatu 23, proceeding northbound on Kauppakatu.
2. A blue 2020 Ford Focus, registered FO-67890, operated by Ms. Sanna Pitkänen, a student from Ratinauksenranta 15, traveling eastbound on Ratinauksenranta.
3. A red 2018 Volkswagen Golf, identified as FI-24680, driven by Mr. Jussi Laine, a delivery driver from Kauppakatu 45, heading southbound on Kauppakatu.
4. A white 2021 Honda Civic, marked FI-35791, operated by Ms. Anna Mäkelä, an office worker residing at Ratinauksenranta 32, traveling westbound on Ratinauksenranta.

**Timeline of Events:**

- At 18:10 hours, windy conditions with gusts up to 45 km/h were reported at the intersection, contributing to reduced visibility and challenging driving conditions.
  
- At 18:13 hours, Ms. Pitkänen, in her Ford Focus, approached the uncontrolled intersection on Ratinauksenranta intending to turn left onto Kauppakatu. She reportedly misjudged the speed and distance of oncoming traffic due to the windy conditions.

- Simultaneously, at 18:14 hours, Mr. Laine in his Volkswagen Golf was southbound on Kauppakatu, nearing the intersection intending to turn right onto Ratinauksenranta. He was unaware of Ms. Pitkänen's intentions.

- At 18:15 hours, the collision occurred when Ms. Pitkänen's vehicle collided with Mr. Laine's Golf at the intersection. The impact caused both vehicles to spin, with the Corolla (driven by Mr. Koskinen) attempting to avoid the crash but striking the rear of the Focus.

- Moments later, at 18:15:30 hours, Ms. Mäkelä in her Honda Civic, traveling westbound on Ratinauksenranta, was unable to stop due to the sudden braking of the vehicles ahead and collided with the Focus from the side.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The prevailing weather conditions during the incident were windy with gusts, significantly affecting visibility and road stability. The strong winds made it difficult for drivers to maintain control, contributing to the misjudgment of distances and speeds, ultimately leading to the chain-reaction collision.

**Vehicle Damage:**

1. **Toyota Corolla (KY-12345):** Sustained damage to the front passenger side, with a bent fender and scratches along the paneling.
2. **Ford Focus (FO-67890):** Heavy damage to the driver's side, including a crumpled door and significant frontal impact.
3. **Volkswagen Golf (FI-24680):** Rear-end damage with a broken taillight and dented trunk lid.
4. **Honda Civic (FI-35791):** Side panel damage, including a scraped door and minor dents.

**Injuries:**

All drivers and passengers involved sustained minor injuries, primarily from whiplash due to the sudden stops and impacts. They were transported to the nearest hospital for evaluation and treatment.

**Witnesses:**

Two pedestrians, Mr. Olli Mäki and Ms. Leena Rantanen, witnessed the incident from a nearby café on Kauppakatu and provided statements corroborating the sequence of events.

This report is submitted for further investigation and insurance claims processing. Further details may emerge as interviews with involved parties and analysis of vehicle data recorders (if available) are conducted.
