**Traffic Incident Report**

*Incident Number:* 2024-YV-0067  
*Date of Incident:* 09.06.2024  
*Location:* Intersection of Kauppakatu and Ratinkatu, Ylivieska, Finland  
*Reporting Officer:* Inspector Jouko Hietala, Ylivieska Police Department  

**Narrative:**

On the evening of 09.06.2024, at approximately 21:30 hours, a two-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ratinkatu in Ylivieska, Finland. The vehicles involved were a grey 2018 Toyota Corolla, registered with the license plate 123-ABC, driven by Mr. Mikko Kivinen, a 34-year-old local resident of Kauppakatu 15, and a silver 2020 Ford Focus, registered with the license plate 456-DEF, operated by Ms. Anna Pitkänen, a 29-year-old resident of Ratinkatu 32.

Mr. Kivinen was traveling westbound on Kauppakatu approaching the intersection, while Ms. Pitkänen was proceeding southbound on Ratinkatu. According to witness statements and CCTV footage from a nearby business, Ms. Pitkänen proceeded through the intersection without fully stopping at the stop sign, colliding with Mr. Kivinen's vehicle as it entered the intersection.

**Timeline of Events:**

- 21:28 hours: Ms. Pitkänen's Ford Focus reaches Ratinkatu and begins to approach the intersection.
- 21:29 hours: Mr. Kivinen's Toyota Corolla reaches the stop line on Kauppakatu, preparing to cross Ratinkatu.
- 21:30 hours: Ms. Pitkänen fails to come to a complete stop at the stop sign, entering the intersection.
- 21:30 hours (approximate): Collision occurs as Ms. Pitkänen's vehicle strikes the passenger side of Mr. Kivinen's car.
- 21:31 hours: Both vehicles come to a halt on the intersection, partially blocking traffic flow.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The incident took place under icy road conditions, as a light snowfall had occurred earlier in the evening, leaving a thin layer of ice on the roads. The icy surfaces contributed to reduced traction, exacerbating Ms. Pitkänen's inability to bring her vehicle to a complete stop at the intersection.

**Vehicle Damage:**

The Toyota Corolla sustained damage primarily to its passenger side, including a dented door and scratches along the side panel. The Ford Focus incurred front-end damage, with the passenger side headlight shattered and minor scrapes on the bumper. Both vehicles were towed from the scene for further inspection and repair.

**Witnesses:**

Two pedestrians, Mr. Jari Lehtinen and Ms. Laura Mäkelä, witnessed the incident and provided statements corroborating each other's accounts. They noted that Ms. Pitkänen's vehicle did not appear to slow down significantly before entering the intersection.

**Officer's Observations:**

Upon arrival, I observed icy road conditions consistent with recent snowfall. The skid marks from both vehicles indicated a loss of control leading up to the collision. Ms. Pitkänen was administered a preliminary breath test, which did not detect any alcohol. However, given the icy conditions and her failure to stop completely, she will be cited for running a stop sign and driving without due care and attention.

This report is submitted for further investigation and potential legal action as deemed appropriate by the Ylivieska District Court.
