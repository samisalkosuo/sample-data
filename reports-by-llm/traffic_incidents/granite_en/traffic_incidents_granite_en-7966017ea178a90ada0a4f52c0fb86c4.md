**Narrative:**

On the evening of 08.02.2025, at approximately 17:45 hours, a four-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Etelä-Karveinenkatu and Kauppakatu in the municipality of Kerava, Finland. The incident involved a grey 2018 Toyota Corolla driven by Mr. Mikko Koskinen, 34, residing at Vuotijärvenie 12; a white 2020 Ford Focus driven by Ms. Anna Pitkänen, 29, from Kauppiakademi 5; a black 2017 Volkswagen Passat driven by Mr. Jussi Rantala, 41, living at Hietalahdenkatu 30; and a silver 2019 Honda Civic driven by Ms. Sanna Lehtinen, 30, residing at Kauppakatu 87.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **17:40 hours:** Mr. Koskinen, driving west on Etelä-Karveinenkatu towards the intersection, approached with overcast weather conditions reducing visibility slightly. Ms. Pitkänen, traveling north on Kauppakatu, proceeded through a green light.

- **17:42 hours:** Mr. Rantala, in his Volkswagen Passat, was heading south on Kauppakatu and turned left onto Etelä-Karveinenkatu just as Ms. Pitkänen entered the intersection. The overcast skies contributed to reduced visibility, impairing both drivers' ability to accurately judge distances and speeds.

- **17:43 hours:** As Mr. Rantala initiated his left turn, he collided with Ms. Pitkänen's Ford Focus, causing significant damage to the passenger side of her vehicle. The impact propelled Ms. Pitkänen’s car into the path of Mr. Koskinen's Corolla, which was unable to stop in time due to the reduced visibility and slippery road conditions caused by the overcast weather.

- **17:44 hours:** Mr. Koskinen's vehicle struck the rear passenger side of Ms. Lehtinen’s Honda Civic, which was stationary at a red traffic light on Kauppakatu, awaiting its green signal. The force of the collision pushed Ms. Lehtinen's car into the intersection, where it came to rest against a traffic signal pole.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The prevailing weather condition during this incident was overcast, with reduced visibility due to low-lying cloud cover. Although no precipitation was reported, the roads were slightly damp from intermittent rainfall earlier in the day, contributing to slippery conditions that affected vehicle braking and handling.

**Vehicle Damage:**

1. **Toyota Corolla (Mikko Koskinen):** Rear driver's side damage, including a bent bumper and scrapes along the passenger door.
2. **Ford Focus (Anna Pitkänen):** Passenger side severe damage, with crumpled metal and airbag deployment.
3. **Volkswagen Passat (Jussi Rantala):** Front driver's side impact, resulting in a dented hood and front bumper.
4. **Honda Civic (Sanna Lehtinen):** Rear passenger-side collision, with significant damage to the door and rear quarter panel.

**Witnesses:**

Two pedestrians, Mr. Petteri Mäkelä and Ms. Laura Kivinen, witnessed the incident from a nearby café on Etelä-Karveinenkatu. They provided statements confirming the sequence of events and corroborating the described weather conditions.

**Investigation Status:**

The scene was secured, and all vehicles involved were towed for examination. Preliminary investigations suggest that speed was a contributing factor, though full analysis of vehicle data recorders (black boxes) is pending. All drivers were transported to the Kerava Health Centre for assessment with minor injuries reported.

This report is preliminary and subject to change as further investigation and evidence analysis progress. Further updates will be provided as necessary.
