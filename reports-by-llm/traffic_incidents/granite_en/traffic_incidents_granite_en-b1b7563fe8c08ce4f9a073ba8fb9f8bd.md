*Location:* Vesilahti, Finland  
*Time of Day:* Morning  
*Weather Conditions:* Windy with gusts  

**Incident Description:**

On the morning of 04th March, 2025, at approximately 08:30 hours, a three-vehicle traffic incident occurred on Kauppakatu, a primary street in Vesilahti. The windy conditions with gusts added an element of complexity to the situation.

**Participants Involved:**

1. **Driver A**: Jari Koskinen, 42 years old, residing at Kauppakatu 10, Vesilahti. Driving a silver 2018 Volvo V60 with Finnish license plate 123-ABC.

2. **Driver B**: Anna Pitkänen, 35 years old, residing at Mäkelänkatu 24, Vesilahti. Operating a blue 2019 Toyota Corolla bearing the license plate 456-DEF.

3. **Driver C**: Olli Miettinen, 58 years old, residing at Kauppakatu 45, Vesilahti. Driving a red 2017 Ford Focus with license plate 789-GHI.

**Sequence of Events:**

At approximately 08:25 hours, Jari Koskinen was driving his Volvo V60 eastbound on Kauppakatu towards the town center. As he approached the intersection with Mäkelänkatu, strong gusts of wind caused a loose signpost to detach from a nearby construction site, falling onto the roadway.

Anna Pitkänen, driving her Toyota Corolla westbound on Mäkelänkatu, was preparing to turn left onto Kauppakatu. She noticed the fallen signpost but misjudged its trajectory due to the wind's unpredictability. In an attempt to avoid it, she swerved sharply, losing control of her vehicle.

Simultaneously, Olli Miettinen was driving his Ford Focus eastbound on Kauppakatu, approaching the same intersection. Seeing Anna’s erratic maneuver, he braked hard to avoid a collision but was unable to prevent his vehicle from colliding with the rear of Anna's Toyota Corolla.

The impact pushed Anna's car into Jari Koskinen's path. Despite Jari's efforts to steer clear, the combined force of the collisions resulted in a chain reaction, causing significant damage to all three vehicles.

**Damage Descriptions:**

- **Volvo V60 (Driver A):** Sustained substantial front-end damage, including a crumpled hood and a damaged headlight. Airbag deployment was noted.

- **Toyota Corolla (Driver B):** Experienced severe rear-end impact, with the trunk lid caved in and the rear bumper detached. The vehicle also showed signs of skidding marks indicating loss of control.

- **Ford Focus (Driver C):** Received considerable frontal damage, with the front grille and bumper significantly deformed. Airbag deployment was observed.

**Witnesses:**

Two passersby, Marko Rantanen and Sanna Lehtinen, witnessed the incident from a nearby café on Kauppakatu. They provided statements confirming the sequence of events and the weather conditions at the time.

**Weather Impact:**

The windy conditions with gusts played a critical role in this incident. The detached signpost, exacerbated by unpredictable gusts, initiated a chain of reactions leading to the collisions. Visibility was not significantly impaired, but the sudden and unexpected movement of the signpost posed a hazard that none of the drivers could anticipate or fully react to in time.

**Conclusion:**

This incident report details a multi-vehicle collision on Kauppakatu in Vesilahti, Finland, on 04th March, 2025, during morning hours under windy conditions. The unforeseen detachment of a signpost due to strong gusts led to a series of unavoidable collisions involving three vehicles. All drivers and passengers sustained minor injuries, and no life-threatening conditions were reported. The Finnish Traffic Police are conducting further investigations into the construction site's safety measures in response to this incident.
