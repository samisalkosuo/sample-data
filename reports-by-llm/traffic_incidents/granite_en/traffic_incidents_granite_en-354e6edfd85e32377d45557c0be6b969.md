**Narrative:**

On the afternoon of 20 December 2022, at approximately 14:30 hours, a four-vehicle traffic incident occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Rannikko in Sipoo, Finland. The weather was overcast, with reduced visibility contributing to the complexity of the situation.

The vehicles involved were operated by the following individuals:

1. **Driver A:** Jari Koskinen, a 42-year-old local resident driving a blue 2018 Volvo V60 with Finnish license plate 123-ABC registered to an address on Kauppakatu.
2. **Driver B:** Marko Hietala, a 35-year-old delivery driver in a white 2019 Ford Focus ST-Line, bearing the license plate 456-DEF, registered at Rannikko Avenue.
3. **Driver C:** Anna Pitkänen, a 28-year-old student driving a red 2017 Honda Civic, with the license plate 789-GHI, registered on Kauppakatu.
4. **Driver D:** Olli Mäkelä, a 56-year-old retired engineer in a grey 2015 Toyota Corolla, displaying the license plate JKL-MNO, registered at Rannikko Road.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **14:28 hours:** Driver A, Koskinen, was proceeding northbound on Kauppakatu approaching the intersection with Rannikko.
- **14:29 hours:** Driver B, Hietala, traveling eastbound on Rannikko, entered the intersection intending a left turn onto Kauppakatu.
- **14:30 hours:** The collision occurred as Driver B's Ford Focus collided with Driver C's Honda Civic, which was proceeding through the intersection in the same direction as Koskinen but in the right lane. The impact caused Anna Pitkänen’s vehicle to spin, striking Driver D's Toyota Corolla, which was waiting to turn right from Rannikko onto Kauppakatu.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The overcast weather reduced visibility, contributing to the difficulty in assessing traffic conditions at the intersection. Although no precipitation was reported, the diffuse lighting may have impaired drivers' ability to perceive each other's movements clearly. The road surface was dry but showed signs of wear typical for a Finnish winter approaching, potentially affecting traction during sudden maneuvers.

**Vehicle Damage:**

- **Volvo V60 (123-ABC):** Sustained damage to the front passenger side, including a dented fender and scratches along the door.
- **Ford Focus ST-Line (456-DEF):** Significant frontal damage, with the left headlight caved in and paint transfer indicating contact with the Honda Civic.
- **Honda Civic (789-GHI):** Extensive side damage, including a crumpled passenger door and scrapes along the rear quarter panel from impact with the Toyota Corolla.
- **Toyota Corolla (JKL-MNO):** Minor front-end damage, primarily to the driver's side bumper, resulting from the final collision with the Honda Civic.

**Witness Statements:**

Several pedestrians near the scene provided consistent accounts of the events, noting that Driver B appeared to have misjudged the oncoming traffic while making a left turn. No criminal negligence was observed, and all drivers involved cooperated with investigators.

**Conclusion:**

The incident appears to be a result of a misjudgment in turning maneuvers compounded by reduced visibility due to overcast conditions. All parties were accountable for their actions, and no evidence suggests gross negligence or reckless driving. The investigation is ongoing to determine liability fully, with all vehicles temporarily impounded for detailed examination.
