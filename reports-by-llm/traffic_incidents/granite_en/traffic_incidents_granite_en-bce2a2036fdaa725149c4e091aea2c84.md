**Narrative:**

On the morning of 09 April 2025, at approximately 08:15, a three-vehicle traffic incident occurred at the intersection of Kauppiaselkä and Hyrynsalonkatu in Kemijärvi. The vehicles involved were driven by local residents:

1. **Driver A**: Mikael Järvinen, 42 years old, residing at Valtionpuistari 12, Kemijärvi. He was driving a 2018 Ford Focus with Finnish license plate 123-ABC.

3. **Driver C**: Olli Mäkelä, 58 years old, residing at Hyrynsalonpuisto 9, Kemijärvi. He was behind the wheel of a 2015 Toyota Corolla with license plate 789-GHI.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **08:10 AM**: Mikael Järvinen, driving north on Kauppiaselkä towards the intersection, encountered mixed snow and rain conditions. Visibility was reduced due to the precipitation mixing with freshly fallen snow.
  
- **08:12 AM**: Anna-Liisa Rantala, approaching from the east on Hyrynsalonkatu, also faced challenging road conditions. She was proceeding cautiously but lost traction due to the mixed precipitation, causing her vehicle to slide towards the intersection.

- **08:14 AM**: Olli Mäkelä, traveling west on Hyrynsalonkatu, noticed Rantala's vehicle losing control and attempted to brake. However, the wet and slippery road surface prevented him from avoiding a collision with her car.

- **08:15 AM**: Järvinen, having reduced speed due to the approaching intersection, collided first with Mäkelä's vehicle as Mäkelä tried to avoid Rantala. The impact pushed Mäkelä’s Corolla into Rantala’s Volvo, causing significant damage to all three vehicles.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The morning was characterized by intermittent rainfall mixed with fresh snow, reducing visibility and creating hazardous road conditions. The temperature was just above freezing at 3°C, exacerbating the icy patches on the road surface.

- **Toyota Corolla (789-GHI)**: Heavy frontal and side damage, with the passenger side door severely dented from the collision with Rantala’s Volvo.

- **Volvo V60 (456-DEF)**: Significant rear-end damage, including a smashed trunk and broken taillights from being struck by Mäkelä's Corolla after the initial impact.
