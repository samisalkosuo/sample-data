**Incident Description:**

On the morning of 11th May 2025, at approximately 09:45 AM, a three-vehicle traffic incident occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Mannerheimintie in Hankasalmi, Finland. The weather conditions were challenging due to an ongoing thunderstorm, which included heavy rainfall and significantly reduced visibility.

**Vehicles Involved:**

1. **Driver A:** Jari Koskinen, a local resident of 23 Kauppakatu, was driving a 2018 Volvo V60 with Finnish license plate 123-AB-45. Mr. Koskinen was traveling eastbound on Kauppakatu approaching the intersection.

2. **Driver B:** Maria Pitkänen, residing at 7 Mannerheimintie, was operating a 2020 Toyota Corolla bearing license plate 678-XY-90. Ms. Pitkänen was heading southbound on Mannerheimintie.

3. **Driver C:** Olli Rantala, from address 45 Kauppakatu, drove a 2016 Ford Focus with the license plate 345-LM-67. Mr. Rantala was proceeding eastbound on Kauppakatu and was the third vehicle to enter the intersection.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **09:43 AM:** Maria Pitkänen, approaching the intersection from Mannerheimintie, reported reduced visibility due to heavy rainfall. She slowed her vehicle but proceeded cautiously, adhering to the 50 km/h speed limit.

- **09:44 AM:** Jari Koskinen, in his Volvo V60, was traveling at approximately 45 km/h as he neared the intersection on Kauppakatu. The thunderstorm intensified, causing water to accumulate rapidly on the road surface.

- **09:44 AM:** Olli Rantala, driving his Ford Focus, was following closely behind Jari Koskinen. Despite the adverse weather conditions, Mr. Rantala maintained a speed of about 40 km/h, failing to adjust for the reduced visibility and slippery road conditions.

- **09:45 AM:** As Jari Koskinen entered the intersection, he attempted to yield to Maria Pitkänen's southbound vehicle. However, due to the heavy rain and poor visibility, both drivers misjudged each other’s intentions and speeds. Simultaneously, Olli Rantala, not having sufficient distance to react, collided with the rear of Mr. Koskinen's Volvo.

- **09:45 AM (Collision):** The impact caused Mr. Koskinen's vehicle to lose control and spin, striking Maria Pitkänen’s Toyota Corolla on its passenger side as it crossed the intersection. All vehicles sustained damage, with the Volvo suffering significant frontal and rear-end damage, the Ford Focus displaying heavy denting to the driver's side, and the Toyota exhibiting substantial side panel damage.

**Witnesses:**

A passerby, Sari Lehtinen, who was walking her dog along Kauppakatu, witnessed the incident. She provided a statement confirming the sequence of events and the weather conditions at the time.

**Road Conditions:**

The intersection, already prone to standing water due to its low-lying nature, was exacerbated by the thunderstorm. The rain had washed oil and debris onto the road surface, creating extremely slippery conditions that contributed to the severity of the collision.

**Damages:**

- **Volvo V60 (Driver A):** Extensive damage to the front and rear panels, airbag deployment, and wheel misalignment.
- **Toyota Corolla (Driver B):** Side panel denting, passenger side door malfunction, and minor internal damage.
- **Ford Focus (Driver C):** Driver's side door severely dented, hood crumpled, and front bumper detached.

**Injuries:**

All drivers involved sustained minor injuries and were transported to the Hankasalmi Hospital for evaluation. No passengers were reported in any of the vehicles.

**Investigation Status:**

The scene was secured, and evidence collected, including photographs, skid marks analysis, and witness statements. The investigation is ongoing to determine liability fully, considering weather conditions and potential contributing factors such as vehicle maintenance and driver behavior. Further analysis will include forensic examination of the vehicles and any available CCTV footage from nearby establishments.
