**Narrative:**

On the evening of 12th March 2023, at approximately 18:45 hours, a two-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ruotsalanpuro in the municipality of Siikajoki, Finland. The incident involved a grey 2019 Toyota Corolla, registered with the license plate '345-TOY-SF', driven by Mr. Mikko Koskinen, a 38-year-old local resident of Kauppakatu 23, and a silver 2020 Ford Focus, identified by its license plate '789-FOR-SL', operated by Ms. Anna Pitkänen, a 25-year-old residing at Ruotsalanpuro 11.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **18:30 hours:** Ms. Pitkänen, driving her Ford Focus from the south on Ruotsalanpuro towards the intersection, encounters mixed snow and rain conditions. Visibility is reduced due to the precipitation mixing with freshly fallen snow, making the road surface slippery.

- **18:35 hours:** Mr. Koskinen, driving north on Kauppakatu in his Toyota Corolla, approaches the intersection intending to turn left onto Ruotsalanpuro. He reduces speed as per the traffic signs but is further slowed by the adverse weather conditions.

- **18:40 hours:** As Mr. Koskinen nears the intersection, Ms. Pitkänen proceeds cautiously but misjudges the distance and speed of oncoming traffic due to the poor visibility. She fails to fully stop at the stop sign on Ruotsalanpuro.

- **18:45 hours:** The Ford Focus enters the intersection, colliding with the front passenger side of the Toyota Corolla. Both vehicles sustain damage; the Corolla exhibits significant frontal denting and a flattened passenger-side airbag, while the Focus shows scratches along its driver's side and a damaged headlight.

**Witnesses:**

Two pedestrians, Mr. Jussi Laine and Ms. Leena Rautio, who were walking their dogs in adjacent yards, witnessed the incident. They reported that Ms. Pitkänen appeared to be distracted momentarily before proceeding into the intersection.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The weather at the time of the incident was described as mixed snow and rain, with reduced visibility due to the precipitation mixing with fresh snow on the road surface. The roads were wet and slippery, contributing factors in the misjudgment of distances and speeds by both drivers.

**Damage Assessment:**

- **Toyota Corolla (345-TOY-SF):** Front passenger-side damage, airbag deployment, and minor rear-end collision with a street sign. Estimated repair costs: €3,000.

- **Ford Focus (789-FOR-SL):** Driver's side scratches, damaged headlight, and front bumper impact. Estimated repair costs: €2,500.

**Further Actions:**

Both drivers were transported to the Siikajoki Central Hospital for routine medical checks and released with no serious injuries. The vehicles have been impounded at the Siikajoki Police Station's garage for further investigation and evidence collection. Ms. Pitkänen has been issued a citation for failing to obey a stop sign, and an additional warning for driving under adverse weather conditions without due caution.

This report is submitted for further investigation and potential insurance claims processing. Any additional inquiries should be directed to Inspector Jari Hietala at the Siikajoki Police Department.
