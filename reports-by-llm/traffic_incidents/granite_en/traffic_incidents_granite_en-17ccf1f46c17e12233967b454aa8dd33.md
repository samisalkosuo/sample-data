**Narrative:**

On the morning of 02.06.2023, at approximately 08:15, a three-vehicle traffic incident occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ratinauksenranta in Sodankylä, Finland. The vehicles involved were a grey 2019 Toyota Corolla, registered as FIN-123-A, driven by Ms. Aino Mäkelä, a local teacher residing at 45 Kauppakatu; a blue 2020 Ford Focus, identified as FIN-987-B, operated by Mr. Jussi Hietala, a construction worker from 12 Ratinauksenranta; and a white 2018 Volvo V60, marked with FIN-456-C, driven by Ms. Kaisa Pitkäranta, a nurse living at 78 Kauppakatu.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **08:05 AM:** Mr. Hietala, driving the Ford Focus, approached the intersection from the north on Ratinauksenranta, intending to turn left onto Kauppakatu. Ms. Mäkelä in the Corolla was proceeding south along Kauppakatu towards the same intersection.
- **08:12 AM:** The road conditions were wet and slippery due to overnight rain, which had not yet ceased. Visibility was moderate with light fog. Ms. Pitkäranta in the Volvo was traveling south on Kauppakatu, following Ms. Mäkelä closely.
- **08:14 AM:** As Mr. Hietala initiated his left turn, he lost traction on the slippery road surface. His vehicle began to skid towards the southbound lane where Ms. Pitkäranta was driving. Simultaneously, Ms. Mäkelä, noticing the Ford's erratic movement, attempted to brake but could only reduce her speed significantly due to the wet conditions.
- **08:15 AM:** The Ford Focus collided with the Volvo V60 driven by Ms. Pitkäranta, pushing it slightly off its lane. Subsequently, the impact caused the Corolla, driven by Ms. Mäkelä, to collide with the rear passenger side of the Ford Focus.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The weather on the day of the incident was predominantly wet with intermittent light fog, contributing to reduced visibility and slippery road surfaces. These conditions likely played a significant role in Mr. Hietala's loss of control over his vehicle.

**Vehicle Damages:**

- The Ford Focus, driven by Mr. Hietala, sustained damage primarily to its rear passenger side, including a dented door and scratches along the side panel.
- The Volvo V60, operated by Ms. Pitkäranta, showed impact marks on the front driver's side, indicating the point of collision with the Ford Focus.
- The Toyota Corolla, driven by Ms. Mäkelä, had damage to its front passenger side, consistent with a low-speed impact from the rear of the Ford Focus.

**Injuries:**

Fortunately, no serious injuries were reported among the drivers or passengers involved in the incident. All parties sought medical attention at the scene as a precaution due to the nature of the collision but were later released without requiring further treatment.

Two pedestrians, Mr. Olli Koskinen and Ms. Leena Rantanen, who were walking their dogs in the vicinity, provided statements corroborating the sequence of events. They noted the slippery conditions and observed the vehicles involved immediately following the collision.
