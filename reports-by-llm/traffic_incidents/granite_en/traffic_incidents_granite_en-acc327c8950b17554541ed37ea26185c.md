**Narrative:**

On the evening of 06.03.2024, at approximately 21:15 hours, a three-vehicle traffic incident occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ruotsalanpuro in Laitila, Finland. The weather was clear and sunny, with no adverse conditions reported.

The vehicles involved were operated by the following individuals:

1. **Driver A:** Jari Koskinen, 34, a local resident of Ruotsalanpuro, driving a blue 2018 Volvo V60 with Finnish license plate 123-ABC.
2. **Driver B:** Anna Pitkänen, 29, residing on Kauppakatu, operating a red 2020 Toyota Corolla bearing the license plate 456-DEF.
3. **Driver C:** Mikko Räty, 41, from a nearby village, driving a grey 2017 Ford Focus with license plate 789-GHI.

According to witness statements and on-scene evidence, Driver A was proceeding northbound on Kauppakatu towards the intersection intending to turn left onto Ruotsalanpuro. Driver B was traveling southbound on Kauppakatu, approaching the same intersection. Meanwhile, Driver C was heading eastbound on Ruotsalanpuro, preparing to turn right onto Kauppakatu.

As Driver A entered the intersection, intending to make a left turn, their vehicle collided with Driver B's Corolla, which was in the process of passing through the intersection traveling southbound on Kauppakatu. The impact caused Driver B’s vehicle to spin, coming to rest facing northbound on the western side of the intersection.

Simultaneously, the collision's force propelled Driver A's Volvo partially into the eastbound lane of Ruotsalanpuro, where it struck Driver C's Ford Focus, which was waiting to turn right. This secondary impact pushed both vehicles off their intended paths, with the Volvo coming to a stop against a lamppost and the Ford Focus colliding with a nearby tree.

**Timeline of Events:**

- 21:10 hours: All drivers prepare for the intersection approach.
- 21:14 hours: Driver A signals left turn intention on Kauppakatu.
- 21:15 hours: Collision occurs between Volvo (Driver A) and Corolla (Driver B).
- 21:15-21:16 hours: Secondary collision between Volvo (now impacted by initial crash) and Ford Focus (Driver C).

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The clear, sunny weather provided excellent visibility. There were no road hazards reported, and the dry asphalt offered standard traction. However, the glare from the setting sun might have temporarily impaired vision for some drivers, contributing to the misjudgment of distances or speeds.

**Vehicle Damage:**

1. **Volvo V60 (Driver A):** Significant front-end damage, including a crumpled hood and damaged headlights. Airbag deployment indicated occupant restraint.
2. **Toyota Corolla (Driver B):** Rear-end struck, resulting in substantial structural damage to the passenger side and deployed airbags.
3. **Ford Focus (Driver C):** Heavy frontal impact caused by the secondary collision, leading to severe damage to the driver's side and deployment of airbags.

**Witness Statements:**

Several pedestrians near the scene reported seeing Driver A's vehicle enter the intersection without fully clearing southbound traffic, suggesting a potential failure to yield. Witnesses also noted that Driver B appeared to be traveling within speed limits but may have been startled by the sudden appearance of Driver A’s turning vehicle.

**Investigation Status:**

The scene was secured, and all vehicles were towed for further examination. Drivers A, B, and C were transported to the Laitila Hospital for medical evaluation, with no life-threatening injuries reported. The investigation is ongoing, focusing on potential contributing factors such as driver distraction or misjudgment in clear but low-visibility conditions.
