- **08:25 hours:** Ms. Pitkänen, driving her Toyota Corolla from the south on Ratinkatu, approached the intersection intending to turn left onto Kauppakatu. Mr. Kivinen, in his Volvo V60, was traveling north along Kauppakatu.
- **08:27 hours:** As Ms. Pitkänen entered the intersection, visibility was significantly reduced due to dense fog rolling in from the nearby lake. She failed to notice Mr. Kivinen's vehicle approaching.

**Witnesses:**

Mr. Jari Lehtinen, a local baker residing at 34 Kauppakatu, provided a statement confirming he saw Ms. Pitkänen initiate her left turn without fully clearing Mr. Kivinen’s path. He also noted the poor visibility due to fog.
