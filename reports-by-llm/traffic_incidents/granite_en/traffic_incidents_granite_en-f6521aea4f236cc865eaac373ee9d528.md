**Traffic Incident Report**

*Incident Number:* 2024-VIM-001  
*Date of Incident:* 20th June 2024  
*Location:* Intersection of Kauppakatu and Ruotsalanpuro, Vimpeli, Finland  
*Reporting Officer:* Inspector Jouko Hietala, Vimpeli Police Department  

**Narrative:**

On the afternoon of 20th June 2024, at approximately 14:30 hours, a two-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ruotsalanpuro in Vimpeli. The incident involved a white 2019 Toyota Corolla, registered with the license plate '234-FIN-A', driven by Mr. Mikko Koskinen, a 35-year-old local resident of Ruotsalankuja 12, and a silver 2020 Ford Focus, identified by its license plate '567-FIN-B', operated by Ms. Anna Pitkänen, a 28-year-old residing at Kauppiaksenpuro 34.

**Timeline of Events:**

1. **14:20 hours**: Ms. Pitkänen, driving the Ford Focus, was proceeding southbound on Ruotsalanpuro towards its intersection with Kauppakatu. Mr. Koskinen, in the Corolla, was traveling westbound along Kauppakatu approaching the same intersection.

2. **14:25 hours**: As Ms. Pitkänen neared the intersection, she encountered dense fog reducing visibility to less than 50 meters. Despite reducing her speed, she proceeded cautiously but found it challenging to discern Mr. Koskinen's approach due to the adverse weather conditions.

3. **14:28 hours**: Mr. Koskinen, unaware of Ms. Pitkänen’s reduced speed due to the fog, continued at the posted 50 km/h limit on Kauppakatu. The combination of speed and impaired visibility led to an inability to halt in time as the vehicles approached the intersection.

4. **14:30 hours**: The front passenger side of Ms. Pitkänen's Ford Focus collided with the driver’s side front of Mr. Koskinen's Toyota Corolla. Both drivers applied their brakes immediately post-impact, but the vehicles came to rest in a skewed position across the intersection.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The prevailing weather at the time was foggy, with visibility significantly reduced to approximately 50 meters. The road surface, although dry, was slick from intermittent light rain that had fallen earlier in the day, contributing to less-than-optimal traction for vehicles.

**Vehicle Damage:**

The Toyota Corolla sustained substantial damage to its front passenger side, including a crumpled fender and a dented door. The Ford Focus incurred damage to its driver’s side front, with a bent hood and scrapes along the bumper. Both vehicles were towed from the scene for further examination and repairs.

**Witnesses:**

Two passersby, Mr. Jari Lehtinen and Ms. Laura Mäkelä, witnessed the incident and provided statements corroborating the sequence of events. They noted that both drivers appeared shaken but uninjured and that neither driver exhibited signs of impairment due to alcohol or drugs.

**Conclusion:**

The collision was primarily attributed to the reduced visibility caused by fog, which impaired both drivers' ability to perceive each other's approach in a timely manner. No criminal charges were immediately filed, but both drivers received citations for failing to adjust their speed to weather conditions. An investigation into potential additional contributing factors, such as vehicle maintenance and driver fatigue, is ongoing.
