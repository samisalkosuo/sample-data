*Incident Number:* 2024-KER-001  
*Date of Incident:* 12 February 2024  
*Location:* Intersection of Otaniemi Street and Kauppakeskus Avenue, Kerava, Finland  
*Reporting Officer:* Inspector Jouko Mäkelä, Kerava Police Department  

**Narrative:**

On the evening of 12 February 2024, at approximately 21:30 hours, a two-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Otaniemi Street and Kauppakeskus Avenue in Kerava, Finland. The incident involved a grey 2018 Volvo V60, registered with the license plate 92-ABC1, driven by Mr. Mikko Hietanen, a 34-year-old resident of Otaniemi Street, and a silver 2020 Toyota Corolla, identified by its license plate number 34-DEF2, operated by Ms. Anna Pitkänen, a 27-year-old residing on Kauppakeskus Avenue.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **21:28 hours:** Ms. Pitkänen, driving her Toyota Corolla from the south on Kauppakeskus Avenue, approached the intersection intending to turn left onto Otaniemi Street. Mr. Hietanen, in his Volvo V60, was traveling north along Otaniemi Street towards the same intersection.

- **21:29 hours:** As Ms. Pitkänen entered the intersection, she reportedly failed to yield to oncoming traffic, likely due to reduced visibility caused by heavy rainfall. Mr. Hietanen, maintaining a lawful speed in the wet conditions, was unable to avoid a collision.

- **21:30 hours:** The vehicles collided at approximately the center of the intersection. The Volvo struck the passenger side of the Corolla, causing significant damage to both vehicles.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

Heavy rain was reported throughout the Kerava area during the incident period, with visibility severely compromised. The road surface was wet, contributing to reduced traction and increased stopping distances for all drivers.

**Vehicle Damage Description:**

The Volvo V60 sustained substantial damage to its passenger side, including a crumpled front fender, a dented door, and a shattered headlight. The Toyota Corolla incurred damage to its right side, with a bent passenger-side door, a broken rear tail light, and scratches along the vehicle's length from debris impact.

**Witness Statements:**

A passerby, Mr. Jari Koskinen, provided a statement confirming that Ms. Pitkänen had entered the intersection without checking for oncoming traffic. Another witness, Ms. Laura Rantanen, who was driving behind Mr. Hietanen, corroborated his account of maintaining a safe speed and attempting to avoid the collision through evasive maneuvers.

**Conclusion:**

The collision appears to have resulted from a failure to yield at an intersection during adverse weather conditions. Ms. Pitkänen has been cited for violating Finnish Road Traffic Act Section 68 (failure to yield right of way) and will be held accountable for the incident's consequences. Both drivers sustained minor injuries and were transported to Kerava Central Hospital for evaluation, with no life-threatening conditions reported.
