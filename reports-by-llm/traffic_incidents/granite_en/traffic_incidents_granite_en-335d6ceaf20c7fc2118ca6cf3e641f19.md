**Traffic Incident Report**

*Incident Number:* 230427-FIN-SYSMÄ-01  
*Date of Incident:* 27 April 2023  
*Location:* Intersection of Kauppakatu and Ruotsalanpuro, Sysmä, Finland  
*Reporting Officer:* Inspector Jari Hietala  
*Municipality:* Sysmä  

**Narrative:**

On the evening of 27 April 2023, at approximately 21:45 hours, a three-vehicle traffic incident occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ruotsalanpuro in the municipality of Sysmä, Finland. The weather conditions were snowy, with light snowfall reducing visibility and contributing to slippery road surfaces.

The vehicles involved in the collision were a white 2018 Volvo V60 driven by Mr. Mikko Koskinen, age 45, residing at Kauppakatu 123; a grey 2019 Toyota Corolla operated by Ms. Anna Pitkänen, age 32, from Ruotsalanpuro 456; and a black 2020 Ford Focus driven by Mr. Jussi Laine, age 28, living at Kauppakatu 789.

According to witness statements and evidence gathered at the scene, Ms. Pitkänen was travelling southbound on Ruotsalanpuro approaching the intersection with Kauppakatu. Mr. Koskinen, proceeding westbound on Kauppakatu, attempted to turn left across the path of Ms. Pitkänen's vehicle. Simultaneously, Mr. Laine was travelling northbound on Kauppakatu and collided with Mr. Koskinen's Volvo as it turned left, subsequently pushing it into the side of Ms. Pitkänen's Toyota.

**Timeline of Events:**

- 21:40 hours: Light snowfall begins in Sysmä, reducing visibility and creating slippery road conditions.
- 21:43 hours: Ms. Pitkänen’s Toyota Corolla (license plate 123-AB-45) reaches the stop line at Ruotsalanpuro.
- 21:44 hours: Mr. Koskinen's Volvo V60 (license plate 678-XY-90) enters the intersection from Kauppakatu, intending to turn left onto Ruotsalanpuro.
- 21:44:30 hours: Mr. Laine’s Ford Focus (license plate 345-MN-67) travelling north on Kauppakatu fails to reduce speed adequately and strikes the rear of Mr. Koskinen's Volvo, pushing it into Ms. Pitkänen's path.
- 21:44:45 hours: The Toyota Corolla collides with the left side of the Volvo, sustaining damage to both vehicles' front ends.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The roads were covered with a light layer of fresh snow, which reduced traction and visibility. Tire tracks at the scene indicate that all drivers were attempting to navigate safely under the challenging conditions. No skid marks were found suggesting excessive speed or reckless driving; however, the slippery roads likely contributed to the inability of Mr. Laine to avoid the collision fully.

**Vehicle Damage:**

- Volvo V60 (driven by Mikko Koskinen): Significant damage to the left front fender and hood, with scrapes along the driver's side. Airbag deployment noted.
- Toyota Corolla (driven by Anna Pitkänen): Front-end collision damage, primarily affecting the passenger side.
- Ford Focus (driven by Jussi Laine): Minor front-end damage, mainly to the bumper and grille area.

**Witnesses:**

Two pedestrians, Mr. Olli Mäkelä and Ms. Leena Rautio, witnessed the incident from a nearby café on Kauppakatu. Their statements corroborate the sequence of events described above.

**Conclusion:**

The collision appears to have resulted from a misjudgment by Mr. Koskinen regarding the safe execution of his left turn, compounded by the adverse weather conditions. Mr. Laine's inability to stop in time, likely due to reduced visibility and slippery roads, led to the secondary impact. No criminal charges are warranted at this stage; however, all drivers will be cited for traffic violations related to failing to maintain safe control of their vehicles under snowy conditions. Further investigation into potential contributing factors such as vehicle maintenance and driver fatigue is ongoing.
