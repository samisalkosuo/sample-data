**Narrative:**

On the evening of 13th September 2024, at approximately 21:45 hours, a two-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ruotsalanpuro in the municipality of Keitele, Finland. The incident involved a grey 2018 Toyota Corolla, registered with the license plate '345-AJK', driven by Mr. Mikko Aalto, a 32-year-old local resident, and a silver 2020 Ford Focus, identified by its license plate '789-DEF', operated by Ms. Anna Kaski, a 27-year-old residing in the neighboring town of Sääksjärvi.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **21:40 hours:** Ms. Kaski, driving westbound on Ruotsalanpuro, approached the intersection intending to turn left onto Kauppakatu. Mr. Aalto, traveling southbound on Kauppakatu in his Toyota Corolla, proceeded through the intersection without incident.
- **21:41 hours:** As Ms. Kaski entered the intersection, she reportedly misjudged the speed of an oncoming vehicle and decided to abort her left turn. 
- **21:42 hours:** In an attempt to avoid a potential collision with Mr. Aalto's vehicle, Ms. Kaski swerved her Ford Focus sharply to the right, crossing into the oncoming lane.
- **21:43 hours:** The sudden maneuver placed Ms. Kaski’s vehicle directly in Mr. Aalto's path. Despite braking, a collision became unavoidable due to the heavy rain and slippery road conditions.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The incident occurred during a period of heavy rainfall, significantly reducing visibility and creating hazardous road conditions. The combination of wet asphalt and rapidly falling rainwater led to compromised traction for both vehicles.

**Vehicle Damage:**

Upon impact, the front passenger side of Mr. Aalto's Toyota Corolla sustained substantial damage, including a collapsed front fender and a crumpled hood. Ms. Kaski’s Ford Focus suffered damage to its driver's side, with a dented door and scrapes along the side panel.

**Witnesses:**

Two passersby, Mr. Jari Pitkäranta and Ms. Laura Virtanen, witnessed the incident from a nearby café on Kauppakatu. They provided statements confirming the described sequence of events and corroborating the drivers' accounts regarding the weather conditions.

**Medical Response:**

Both Mr. Aalto and Ms. Kaski sustained minor injuries and were transported to the Keitele Central Hospital for evaluation. No passengers were involved in this incident.

**Investigation Status:**

The scene was secured, and evidence, including skid marks and debris fields, was documented. Interviews with both drivers and witnesses have been conducted. The investigation is ongoing to determine if any contributing factors, such as vehicle malfunction or driver distraction, played a role in the collision.
