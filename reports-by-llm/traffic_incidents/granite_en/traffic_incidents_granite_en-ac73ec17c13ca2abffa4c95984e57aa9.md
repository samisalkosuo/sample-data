**Narrative:**

On the evening of 12 May 2023, at approximately 18:45 hours, a multi-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ruotsalanpuro in the municipality of Juuka, Finland. The incident involved eleven vehicles, resulting in various degrees of damage and minor injuries to the occupants.

The primary sequence of events unfolded as follows:

At 18:30 hours, a white 2019 Toyota Corolla, registered KY-12345, driven by Mr. Jari Pitkäranta, 34, of Ruotsalanpuro 23, proceeded north on Ruotsalanpuro towards its intersection with Kauppakatu. The road surface was wet and slippery due to intermittent rainfall throughout the evening, contributing to reduced traction.

Simultaneously, a grey 2017 Volvo V60, registered JV-67890, driven by Ms. Anna Kaski, 42, of Kauppakatu 105, approached from the east along Kauppakatu, heading westbound. Ms. Kaski was navigating cautiously but encountered difficulty maintaining control due to the slippery conditions.

As Mr. Pitkäranta's vehicle entered the intersection first, intending to turn left onto Kauppakatu, he misjudged the distance and speed of oncoming traffic, colliding with Ms. Kaski’s Volvo. This initial impact caused both vehicles to lose control, spinning into adjacent lanes.

The force of the collision triggered a chain reaction involving other vehicles in the vicinity. A black 2021 Ford Focus, driven by Mr. Olli Mäkelä, 56, of Kauppakatu 89, was struck from behind as he attempted to brake. Following this, a red 2015 Honda Civic, operated by Ms. Sanna Rautio, 28, of Ruotsalanpuro 45, collided with the Focus, exacerbating the situation.

Additional vehicles involved in the incident included a blue 2016 Nissan Qashqai (JY-23456, driven by Mr. Teppo Kivinen, 39), a silver 2019 BMW 3 Series (BM-78901, driven by Ms. Laura Virtanen, 25), a green 2014 Audi A4 (AU-34567, driven by Mr. Jussi Hietala, 47), a yellow 2018 Hyundai i30 (HY-89012, driven by Ms. Kaisa Lehtinen, 32), a dark grey 2017 Mercedes-Benz C-Class (MC-65432, driven by Mr. Samuli Pekkarinen, 60), a light blue 2020 Subaru Outback (SO-12345, driven by Ms. Maija Koskinen, 44), and a maroon 2019 Dacia Logan (DL-78901, driven by Mr. Timo Hiltunen, 29).

These vehicles were either struck directly or indirectly as they attempted to avoid the primary collision points, leading to significant damage across the involved vehicles. Minor injuries were reported among the drivers and passengers, with most individuals sustaining cuts, bruises, and whiplash from seatbelt restraint. Emergency medical services arrived promptly and transported the injured parties to the nearest hospital for treatment.
