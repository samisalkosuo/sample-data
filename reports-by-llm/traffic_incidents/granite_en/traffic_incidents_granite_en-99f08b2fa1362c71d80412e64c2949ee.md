**Narrative:**

On the morning of 25th June 2024, at approximately 08:15 hours, a three-vehicle traffic incident occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Pohjoiskarinkulma in Myrskylä, Finland. The vehicles involved were a grey 2019 Toyota Corolla, registered as '123-FIN-A45', driven by Mr. Mikko Kivinen, 34, of Pohjoiskarinkulma 12; a blue 2020 Ford Focus, registered as '456-FIN-B12', operated by Ms. Sanna Rantala, 28, residing at Kauppakatu 56; and a white 2017 Volvo V60, identified with the registration '789-FIN-C34', driven by Mr. Jussi Pitkäranta, 42, from Kauppakatu 31.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **08:05 hours:** Ms. Rantala, driving her Ford Focus on Kauppakatu approaching the intersection with Pohjoiskarinkulma, noted wet and slippery road conditions due to overnight rainfall. She reduced speed accordingly but was still unable to prevent skidding as she proceeded into the intersection.

- **08:07 hours:** Mr. Kivinen, driving his Toyota Corolla along Pohjoiskarinkulma, aimed to turn left onto Kauppakatu. He misjudged Ms. Rantala's reduced speed due to the slippery conditions and initiated his turn without yielding to oncoming traffic.

- **08:08 hours:** Mr. Pitkäranta, in his Volvo V60, was traveling eastbound on Kauppakatu towards the intersection. He observed Ms. Rantala's Ford Focus skidding but assumed she would stop. However, due to the slippery conditions and his own vehicle’s reduced traction, he was unable to brake in time to avoid colliding with both Ms. Rantala's and Mr. Kivinen's vehicles.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The morning was characterized by light rain that had left the roads wet and slippery, contributing significantly to the reduced traction experienced by all drivers involved. Visibility was clear, but the combination of wet surfaces and early-morning traffic created hazardous conditions.

**Vehicle Damage:**

1. **Toyota Corolla (123-FIN-A45):** Sustained damage to the front passenger side, including a dented fender and scratches along the panel. The airbag deployed during the collision.

2. **Ford Focus (456-FIN-B12):** Experienced significant damage on the driver's side, with a crumpled front end, broken headlight, and a flat tire from the impact.

3. **Volvo V60 (789-FIN-C34):** The rear passenger side suffered a dent and scratch, while the front bumper was pushed inward due to the force of the collision with Ms. Rantala's vehicle.

**Witness Statements:**

Several pedestrians near the scene reported seeing all three vehicles involved in the incident. One witness, Ms. Eeva Korhonen, described observing Mr. Kivinen's Corolla initiating a left turn without yielding and Ms. Rantala's Focus skidding uncontrollably into the intersection. Another pedestrian, Mr. Olli Mäkelä, noted Mr. Pitkäranta’s Volvo attempting to brake but colliding with both vehicles already in distress.

**Action Taken:**

All parties involved were transported to the nearest hospital for assessment and treatment of minor injuries. The roads were temporarily closed for investigation and cleanup, causing minor traffic disruptions until 09:30 hours when normal traffic flow resumed.

This report is submitted for further investigation and potential charges related to traffic violations, should evidence warrant. All vehicles have been impounded for forensic examination, and the involved parties have been notified of the ongoing investigation.
