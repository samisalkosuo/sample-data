**Traffic Incident Report**

*Incident Number:* 2025-KON-007  
*Date of Incident:* 02.07.2025  
*Location:* Konnevesi, Finland  
*Reporting Officer:* Jari Pietiläinen, Badge #4567  

**Narrative:**

On the evening of 02.07.2025, at approximately 18:30 hours, a two-vehicle collision occurred on Kauppakatu, a primary road in the municipality of Konnevesi, Finland. The incident involved a white 2019 Toyota Corolla, driven by Mr. Mikko Hietala, 34, residing at Kauppiasentie 12, and a grey 2020 Ford Focus, operated by Ms. Anna-Liisa Rantala, 28, from Pohjoiskari street.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **18:25 hours:** Mr. Hietala was driving westbound on Kauppakatu towards the center of Konnevesi, navigating through freshly fallen snow that had begun to accumulate on the road surface, reducing visibility and creating slippery conditions. Ms. Rantala was traveling eastbound on the same road at a moderate speed, also encountering the challenging weather conditions.

- **18:28 hours:** As Mr. Hietala approached the intersection with Pohjoiskarinkatu, he reportedly misjudged the distance to the stop line due to reduced visibility from snowfall. Simultaneously, Ms. Rantala proceeded through the intersection intending to turn left onto Pohjoiskarinkatu.

- **18:29 hours:** The vehicles collided in the intersection. The front passenger side of Mr. Hietala's Corolla struck the driver’s side of Ms. Rantala's Focus, resulting in significant damage to both vehicles. 

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The prevailing weather at the time was snowy, with intermittent flurries reducing visibility. The road surface was covered with a thin layer of fresh snow, contributing to reduced traction and increased stopping distances for both drivers. These conditions were noted by several witnesses, including Mr. Jussi Koskinen, who was walking his dog nearby and stopped to assist.

**Vehicle Details:**

- **Toyota Corolla (Finland License Plate 123-ABCD):** Sustained damage primarily to the front passenger side, including a crumpled fender and a dented door. Airbag deployment was confirmed by responding medical personnel.

- **Ford Focus (Finland License Plate 456-EFGH):** Experienced damage to the driver’s side, with a bent hood and scrapes along the passenger side. The airbag in Ms. Rantala's vehicle also deployed during the collision.

**Witness Statements:**

Mr. Koskinen reported seeing both vehicles approach the intersection cautiously but noted that speeds seemed appropriate given the conditions. He did not observe any erratic driving behavior preceding the collision.

**Conclusion:**

The incident appears to have resulted from a misjudgment of distance by Mr. Hietala, compounded by adverse weather conditions affecting visibility and road traction. Both drivers were transported to Konnevesi Central Hospital for assessment; fortunately, neither sustained life-threatening injuries. No further action beyond standard reporting procedures is deemed necessary at this time.
