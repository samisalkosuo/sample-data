**Traffic Incident Report**

*Incident Number:* 2024-PYT-0806  
*Date of Incident:* 06.08.2024  
*Location:* Intersection of Kauppakatu and Rannikontie, Pyhtää, Finland  
*Reporting Officer:* Jari Pietiläinen, Badge #1234  

**Narrative:**

On the evening of 06.08.2024, at approximately 17:45 hours, a two-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Rannikontie in Pyhtää, Finland. The drivers involved were Mr. Mikko Hietala, 34, residing at 12 Aurora Avenue, and Ms. Anna Kaski, 28, from 5 Borealis Road.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **17:30 hours:** Ms. Kaski was driving her 2019 Volvo XC60, registered with the license plate 123-ABC, southbound on Rannikontie approaching the intersection with Kauppakatu. Mr. Hietala was navigating his 2016 Ford Focus, bearing the license plate 456-DEF, eastbound on Kauppakatu.

- **17:38 hours:** As Ms. Kaski neared the intersection, road conditions deteriorated due to mixed snow and rain, reducing visibility and grip. She maintained her speed, adhering to the 50 km/h speed limit.

- **17:40 hours:** Mr. Hietala proceeded through a green light on Kauppakatu, unaware that Ms. Kaski had not yet entered the intersection due to the poor visibility caused by the adverse weather conditions.

- **17:42 hours:** Upon realizing the impending collision, both drivers applied their brakes. However, the wet and slippery road surface, compounded by the snow, led to a reduced stopping distance for both vehicles.

- **17:43 hours:** The front passenger side of Mr. Hietala's Ford Focus collided with the left rear side of Ms. Kaski's Volvo. Both vehicles came to a stop, partially blocking the intersection.

**Witnesses and Additional Information:**

A passing cyclist, Mr. Jussi Rantanen, who was traveling north on Rannikontie, witnessed the incident and immediately stopped to assist. He reported that both drivers appeared shaken but uninjured.

**Vehicle Damage:**

- The Ford Focus sustained damage to its front passenger fender and hood, with debris scattered across the road.
- The Volvo XC60 bore scratches along its left rear side panel and a dent in the rear quarter panel, with fluid leaks suggesting potential brake or suspension damage.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The weather on the day of the incident was characterized by intermittent rainfall mixed with falling snow, leading to reduced visibility and slippery road surfaces. The Finnish Meteorological Institute's report for Pyhtää indicated a temperature of 4°C, with winds gusting at 15 km/h, further complicating driving conditions.

**Conclusion:**

The collision was primarily caused by the adverse weather conditions impairing visibility and vehicle control, coupled with the drivers' inability to anticipate each other's actions due to reduced sightlines at the intersection. Both parties cooperated fully with investigators, and no citations were issued at this time pending further review of dashcam footage (if available) and any potential contributing factors.
