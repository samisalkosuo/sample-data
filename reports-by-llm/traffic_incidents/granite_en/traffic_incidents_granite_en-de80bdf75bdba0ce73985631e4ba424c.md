**Narrative:**

On the morning of 17th October 2024, at approximately 08:30 hours, a two-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ratinauksenkatu in the municipality of Sipoo, Finland. The incident involved a grey 2019 Toyota Corolla, registered with the license plate '234-FIN-A', driven by Mr. Mikko Kivinen, a 35-year-old local resident, and a silver 2020 Ford Focus, identified by its license plate '567-FIN-B', operated by Ms. Anna Pitkänen, a 28-year-old residing in neighbouring Kerava.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **08:25 hours:** Mr. Kivinen, travelling eastbound on Kauppakatu towards the intersection, reported encountering wet and slippery road conditions due to overnight rainfall.

- **08:27 hours:** Ms. Pitkänen, approaching from the south on Ratinauksenkatu, also noted the adverse weather conditions, reducing visibility and traction.

Both vehicles sustained damage, primarily to their front ends, with the Corolla displaying significant scrapes and dents along its passenger side, while the Focus exhibited a crumpled driver's side door and hood.
