**Traffic Incident Report**

*Incident Number:* 2025-SIK-0034  
*Date of Incident:* 21st March 2025  
*Location:* Intersection of Kauppakatu and Ryhmästrätti, Siikainen, Finland  
*Reporting Officer:* Inspector Jouko Hietala, Siikainen Police Department  

**Narrative:**

On the afternoon of 21st March 2025, at approximately 14:30 hours, a multi-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ryhmästrätti in Siikainen, Finland. The incident involved nine vehicles, resulting in various degrees of damage and minor injuries to the drivers and passengers.

The primary cause of the accident appears to be a combination of mixed snow and rain conditions on the road surface, which significantly reduced visibility and traction for the drivers. At the time, the weather was characterized by intermittent light rain falling over recently fallen snow, creating slick and unpredictable driving conditions.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **14:20 hours:** A Ford Focus driven by Ms. Anna Pietilä, 32, of Kauppakatu 56, Siikainen, was traveling eastbound on Kauppakatu approaching the Ryhmästrätti intersection.
- **14:22 hours:** A Volvo V60, driven by Mr. Jussi Kivinen, 47, of Ryhmästrätti 34, Siikainen, was proceeding northbound on Ryhmästrätti towards the intersection.
- **14:25 hours:** Ms. Pietilä reported reduced visibility due to the mixed weather conditions and attempted to slow down as she neared the intersection, but her vehicle's tires lost traction on the slippery road surface.
- **14:26 hours:** Mr. Kivinen, also affected by the poor road conditions, proceeded cautiously but was unable to bring his vehicle to a complete stop before entering the intersection.
- **14:27 hours:** The Ford Focus, having lost control due to the slick conditions, drifted into the intersection, colliding with the Volvo V60 at an angle. This initial impact triggered a chain reaction.
- **14:28 - 14:30 hours:** Subsequent vehicles entering the intersection from both Kauppakatu and Ryhmästrätti—including a Toyota Corolla (driven by Mr. Lauri Mäkelä), Honda Civic (Ms. Sanna Virtanen), Nissan Qashqai (Mr. Olli Pekkarinen), Ford Mondeo (Ms. Kaisa Rantala), Audi A3 (Mr. Timo Hiltunen), Hyundai i30 (Ms. Mari Lindström), and a Mercedes-Benz C-Class (Mr. Jari Koskinen)—were unable to avoid the primary collision due to the reduced visibility and slippery roads, resulting in multiple minor impacts.

**Witness Statements:**

Several pedestrians and occupants of nearby buildings provided consistent accounts corroborating the sequence of events. Notably, Ms. Liisa Kivinen, a resident at Ryhmästrätti 30, reported seeing the initial collision between the Ford Focus and Volvo V60 and described the subsequent vehicles entering the intersection in rapid succession.

**Road Conditions:**

The road surface was wet with patches of slush due to the ongoing light rain over freshly fallen snow. The combination of these conditions, along with reduced daylight visibility, significantly contributed to the severity of the incident.

**Conclusion:**

This multi-vehicle collision in Siikainen on 21st March 2025 was primarily caused by adverse weather conditions exacerbated by the time of day. All drivers involved were advised regarding safe driving practices under such conditions, and reminders were issued to the community about the necessity for heightened vigilance during inclement weather.
