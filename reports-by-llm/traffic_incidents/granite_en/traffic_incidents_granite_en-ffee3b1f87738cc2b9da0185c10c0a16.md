**Narrative:**

On the evening of 20 May 2025, at approximately 18:30 hours, a two-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ratinkatu in the municipality of Ylivieska, Finland. The incident involved a grey 2019 Toyota Corolla, registered with the license plate 123-ABC, driven by Mr. Mikko Hietanen, a 45-year-old local resident, and a white 2020 Ford Focus, identified by its license plate number 456-DEF, operated by Ms. Anna Koskinen, a 32-year-old resident of nearby Ikaalisto.

**Timeline of Events:**

1. **18:25 hours**: Ms. Koskinen was driving westbound on Ratinkatu approaching the intersection with Kauppakatu. Mr. Hietanen, traveling northbound on Kauppakatu, prepared to turn left onto Ratinkatu.

2. **18:28 hours**: Fog began to roll in, reducing visibility significantly. The weather conditions were classified as 'foggy' according to the Meteorological Service of Finland's records for this period.

3. **18:30 hours**: As Mr. Hietanen initiated his left turn, Ms. Koskinen, despite maintaining a lawful speed, was unable to stop in time due to the reduced visibility caused by the fog. The front passenger side of the Ford Focus collided with the driver's side of the Toyota Corolla.

4. **18:32 hours**: Both vehicles came to a halt on Ratinkatu, partially blocking the roadway. Immediately, several pedestrian witnesses, including Mr. Jari Pitk채ranta and Ms. Laura Kivinen, who were walking their dog nearby, rushed to assist.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The prevailing weather condition at the time of the incident was foggy, with reported visibility reduced to approximately 100 meters. The road surface was dry but the combination of fog and evening lighting contributed to impaired visibility for both drivers. No road maintenance issues were identified post-incident.

**Vehicle Damage:**

The Toyota Corolla sustained damage primarily to its driver's side, including a dented front fender and scratches along the door. The Ford Focus incurred damage to its passenger side, with a crumpled hood and minor paint transfer. Both vehicles were towed from the scene for inspection and repair.

**Witness Statements:**

Mr. Pitk채ranta and Ms. Kivinen corroborated each other's accounts, stating that both drivers appeared to be proceeding cautiously but were unable to avoid the collision due to the adverse weather conditions. No indication of reckless driving or excessive speed was noted by witnesses.

**Conclusion:**

This report reflects a tragic accident exacerbated by challenging foggy conditions during the evening hours in Ylivieska, Finland. Both drivers acted within legal speed limits and demonstrated caution; however, the weather played a critical role in obscuring their paths, leading to the unfortunate collision. No criminal charges are anticipated at this stage, given the circumstances, but further investigation into potential contributing factors such as vehicle headlight effectiveness in fog is ongoing.
