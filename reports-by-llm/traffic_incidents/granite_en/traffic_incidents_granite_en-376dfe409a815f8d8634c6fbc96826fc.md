*Incident Number:* 230220-FIN-HYR-01  
*Date of Incident:* 20 February 2023  
*Location:* Intersection of Kauppakatu and Metsäntie, Hyrynsalmi, Finland  
*Reporting Officer:* Inspector Jouko Pietilä  
*Municipality:* Hyrynsalmi  

**Narrative:**

On the morning of 20 February 2023, at approximately 08:45, a three-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Metsäntie in Hyrynsalmi, Finland. The incident involved a white 2019 Toyota Corolla, driven by Mr. Mikko Kivinen, 34, residing at Kauppakatu 123; a silver 2020 Ford Focus, operated by Ms. Anna Rautio, 28, from Metsäntie 456; and a grey 2017 Volkswagen Passat, driven by Mr. Jussi Hietala, 42, living on Kauppakatu 789.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **08:38**: Ms. Rautio, driving her Ford Focus southbound on Metsäntie, approached the intersection intending to turn left onto Kauppakatu. Mr. Kivinen, in his Corolla, was travelling eastbound along Kauppakatu towards the same intersection.

- **08:40**: Mr. Hietala, driving the Passat westbound on Kauppakatu, proceeded through the intersection intending to turn right onto Metsäntie. He failed to notice Ms. Rautio's intent to turn left due to a brief obstruction caused by a parked delivery van partially blocking his view.

- **08:42**: As Mr. Hietala entered the intersection, his Passat collided with Ms. Rautio’s Ford Focus, pushing it slightly off its intended path. The impact caused Ms. Rautio to lose control, and her vehicle continued moving before striking Mr. Kivinen's Corolla on its passenger side as it travelled eastbound through the intersection.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The morning was dry but unusually cold for early February in Finland, with temperatures around -5°C. The roads were clear of snow or ice, but the combination of low visibility due to a light fog and reduced traction from the frosty conditions likely contributed to the drivers' reaction times.

**Vehicle Damage:**

- Mr. Hietala's Volkswagen Passat sustained damage primarily to its front passenger side, including a dented front bumper and scratches along the driver’s side door.

- Ms. Rautio's Ford Focus suffered significant damage on the driver’s side, with a crumpled front end and side panel. The airbags deployed during the collision.

- Mr. Kivinen's Toyota Corolla incurred damage to its passenger side, affecting the door and rear quarter panel, as well as minor frontal scuffing from the impact with Ms. Rautio’s vehicle.

**Witnesses:**

Two pedestrians, Mr. Petteri Lehtinen and Ms. Laura Koskinen, witnessed the incident while walking their dogs near the intersection. They provided statements confirming the sequence of events and corroborating the drivers' accounts.

**Action Taken:**

Emergency services were promptly dispatched to the scene. All parties involved sustained minor injuries and were transported to Hyrynsalmi Central Hospital for evaluation. The vehicles were towed away, and the intersection was cleared of debris by local road maintenance crews. A preliminary investigation is underway, with further analysis required to determine liability fully.
