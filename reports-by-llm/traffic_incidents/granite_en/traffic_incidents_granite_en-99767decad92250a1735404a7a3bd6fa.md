**Incident Details:**

*Date of Incident:* 21 April 2024  
*Location:* Konnevesi, Finland  
*Time of Day:* Daytime  
*Weather Conditions:* Heavy rain  

**Incident Description:**

On the aforementioned date and time, at approximately 14:30 hours, a two-vehicle collision occurred on Kauppakatu, a primary road in the heart of Konnevesi. The incident involved a grey 2018 Toyota Corolla, registered with the license plate '123-ABC', driven by Mr. Jari Pitkäranta, a local resident aged 45, and a silver 2020 Ford Focus, identified by its license plate '456-DEF', operated by Ms. Kaisa Hietala, a 32-year-old teacher residing in the nearby village of Pohja.

**Narrative:**

Mr. Pitkäranta was traveling eastbound on Kauppakatu towards the town center, intending to reach his workplace at address Kauppakatu 56. Ms. Hietala, en route to drop off her child at the local school located at Kauppakatu 102, was driving westbound in the opposite direction.

As both drivers navigated the slick road surface due to heavy rainfall, Mr. Pitkäranta's vehicle began to hydroplane on a patch of standing water near the intersection with Linnunrata. In an attempt to regain control, he overcorrected his steering, causing his car to drift into the westbound lane directly in front of Ms. Hietala’s Ford Focus.

Despite Ms. Hietala's immediate application of brakes and evasive maneuvering, a collision was unavoidable. The front passenger side of the Corolla struck the driver's side rear corner of the Focus, resulting in significant damage to both vehicles. Fortunately, neither driver nor any passengers sustained serious injuries, though both were shaken by the incident and transported to the Konnevesi Health Center for precautionary checks.

**Witnesses:**

Two pedestrians, Mr. Mikko Koskinen and Ms. Sanna Lehtinen, witnessed the accident from adjacent sidewalks. They confirmed that both drivers had their headlights on and windshield wipers operating at maximum speed to combat the heavy rain. Both also noted that neither vehicle exhibited any mechanical malfunctions prior to the collision.

**Timeline of Events:**

- 14:28 hours: Heavy rain commences in Konnevesi, significantly reducing visibility and road grip.

**Road Conditions:**
