**Narrative of Events:**

On the evening of 06 April 2025, at approximately 18:30, a three-vehicle traffic incident occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ruotsalanpuro in Pukkila, Finland. The vehicles involved were a silver 2019 Toyota Corolla, registered as FIN-123XY, driven by Mr. Mikko Virtanen, 34, of Kauppakatu 56; a blue 2020 Ford Focus, identified as FIN-456ZX, operated by Ms. Sanna Pitkänen, 28, from Ruotsalanpuro 12; and a grey 2017 Volvo V60, marked with the license plate FIN-789LM, driven by Mr. Jussi Kivinen, 45, residing at Länsipuro 3.

**Witness Statements:**

A passerby, Ms. Aino Lehtinen, provided a statement indicating that she observed the Ford Focus proceeding through Ruotsalanpuro with its turn signal activated, intending to turn left onto Kauppakatu. The Toyota Corolla, traveling south on Kauppakatu, appeared to be within the speed limit but was not slowing down as it approached the intersection. Ms. Lehtinen noted that light rain was falling, making visibility moderately challenging.

**Timeline of Events:**

- 18:25: The Ford Focus, driven by Ms. Pitkänen, begins to slow down at the stop sign on Ruotsalanpuro, preparing to turn left onto Kauppakatu.
- 18:27: The Toyota Corolla, driven by Mr. Virtanen, enters the intersection from the north, continuing straight without reducing speed significantly despite approaching a vehicle already signaling a left turn.
- 18:28: Ms. Pitkänen initiates her left turn, colliding with the path of the Corolla. The impact causes both vehicles to spin, with the Corolla striking the curb and coming to rest partially blocking the southbound lane.
- 18:29: The Volvo V60, driven by Mr. Kivinen, traveling east on Ruotsalanpuro towards the intersection, attempts to brake but skids in the light rain, colliding with the rear of the Ford Focus.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

Light rain was reported at the time of the incident, contributing to reduced visibility and potentially slippery road conditions. The roads were dry but wet, which may have affected vehicle braking distances and handling.

**Vehicle Damages:**

- The Toyota Corolla sustained damage to its front passenger side, with the front bumper and headlight assembly significantly compromised. Airbag deployment was noted, indicating occupant restraint.
- The Ford Focus incurred damage to its left rear quarter panel and tailgate, alongside the driver's side door from the subsequent collision with the Volvo.
- The Volvo V60 showed impact marks on its front bumper and hood, consistent with a low-speed collision.

**Injuries:**

Ms. Pitkänen reported minor injuries, primarily from the airbag deployment in her vehicle. Mr. Virtanen was uninjured but shaken. Mr. Kivinen sustained a minor whiplash injury and was transported to the nearby Pukkila Hospital for evaluation as a precautionary measure.

**Investigation Status:**

The scene was secured, and all vehicles were towed to a secure yard for further examination. Witness statements have been recorded, and vehicle data recorders (black boxes) have been retrieved for analysis. The investigation is ongoing to determine liability and any contributing factors, including driver behavior and weather conditions.
