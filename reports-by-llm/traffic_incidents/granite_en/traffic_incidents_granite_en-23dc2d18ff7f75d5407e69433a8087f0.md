**Timeline of Events:**

- At 14:28 hours, Mr. Koskinen initiated his left turn from Ratinauksenranta onto Kauppakatu in front of Ms. Mäkelä's Ford Focus, which was within the designated green light.
- Simultaneously, Mr. Rantanen in the Honda Civic was approaching the intersection from Ratinauksenranta, failing to fully stop at the stop sign due to wet and slippery road conditions.
- Ms. Pietilä in the Toyota Corolla, traveling northbound on Kauppakatu, encountered a reduced traction scenario and was unable to avoid colliding with Mr. Rantanen's vehicle.
- The impact of this initial collision caused the Honda Civic to spin, striking Ms. Lehtinen’s Nissan Qashqai as it proceeded through the intersection.
- Meanwhile, Mr. Virtanen in the BMW 3 Series, following closely behind Mr. Koskinen's Volvo, collided with the rear of the Volvo upon its turn initiation, pushing it further into the path of oncoming traffic.
- Finally, Ms. Kivinen in the Dacia Sandero, traveling westbound on Kauppakatu, was unable to halt in time and struck the rear of Mr. Virtanen's BMW as it came to a stop following the collision with the Volvo.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The prevailing weather conditions at the time of the incident were wet and slippery, attributed to intermittent rainfall over the preceding hours. The road surface was damp, reducing tire grip and contributing to the extended stopping distances and the severity of the collisions.
