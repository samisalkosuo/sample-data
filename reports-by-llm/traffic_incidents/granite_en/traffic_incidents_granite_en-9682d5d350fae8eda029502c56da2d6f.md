**Incident Description:**

On the aforementioned date and time, a two-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Pohjois-Kristiinalan 12 and Etelä-Kristiinalan 34 in Kristiinankaupunki. The incident involved a grey 2018 Volvo V60, registered with the license plate 123-ABC, driven by Mr. Jari Pitkäranta, a 45-year-old local resident, and a white 2020 Toyota Corolla, identified by its license plate number 456-DEF, operated by Ms. Anna Koskinen, a 32-year-old residing in the nearby village of Kristinankangas.

**Timeline of Events:**

1. **09:15 AM:** Mr. Pitkäranten was driving eastbound on Pohjois-Kristiinalan towards the intersection with Etelä-Kristiinalan, maintaining a speed consistent with the posted limit of 40 km/h due to windy conditions causing reduced visibility and requiring caution.
2. **09:15 AM:** Ms. Koskinen approached the same intersection from the south on Etelä-Kristiinalan, traveling at approximately 35 km/h, also adjusting her speed due to wind gusts affecting her vehicle's stability.
3. **09:16 AM:** As Ms. Koskinen neared the intersection, she attempted to make a left turn onto Pohjois-Kristiinalan intending to head east. Mr. Pitkäranten, unaware of Ms. Koskinen's intentions due to obstructed view caused by parked vehicles and wind gusts momentarily impairing his visibility, continued straight through the intersection.
4. **09:16 AM:** The front passenger side of Mr. Pitkäranten’s Volvo collided with the driver's side of Ms. Koskinen's Toyota as she turned left. Both vehicles sustained damage; the Volvo suffered significant front-end structural damage and a flattened front airbag, while the Corolla incurred dents along its passenger side and a damaged door.

**Witness Accounts:**

A passerby, Mr. Mikko Lehtinen, who was walking his dog on Pohjois-Kristiinalan, witnessed the incident and immediately contacted emergency services at 09:17 AM. He reported that both drivers appeared shaken but uninjured.

**Weather Impact:**

The windy conditions with gusts played a crucial role in this incident by reducing visibility and affecting vehicle handling, contributing to the miscommunication between the two drivers at the intersection.

**Damage Assessment:**

Upon inspection, the Volvo sustained approximately €8,000 worth of damage, primarily to its front end, while the Corolla incurred around €5,000 in repairs, mainly affecting its passenger side. Both vehicles were towed from the scene by a local recovery service to a nearby garage for detailed assessment and repair.

**Investigation Status:**

The investigation is ongoing with both drivers cooperating fully. No citations have been issued at this stage pending a thorough review of CCTV footage from nearby businesses, should it be available, and further analysis of weather data to ascertain the exact impact of wind conditions on the incident.
