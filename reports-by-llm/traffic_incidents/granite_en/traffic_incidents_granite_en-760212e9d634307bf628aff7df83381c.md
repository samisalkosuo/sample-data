**Traffic Incident Report**

*Incident Number:* 2024-TOH-012  
*Date of Incident:* 30th November 2024  
*Location:* Intersection of Kauppakatu and Ruotsalanpuro, Tohmajärvi, Finland  
*Reporting Officer:* Inspector Jouko Hietala  
*Municipality:* Tohmajärvi  

**Narrative:**

On the evening of 30th November 2024, at approximately 18:45 hours, a complex multi-vehicle traffic incident occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ruotsalanpuro in Tohmajärvi, Finland. The incident involved a total of eleven vehicles, resulting in various degrees of damage and minor injuries to the drivers and passengers.

The primary cause of this accident appears to be adverse weather conditions combined with driver error. At the time, mixed snow and rain were falling, reducing visibility and creating slippery road surfaces. The roads were not treated with salt or grit due to the unexpected severity of the weather front, which caught both local authorities and drivers off guard.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **18:30 hours:** Weather conditions begin to deteriorate rapidly in Tohmajärvi, transitioning from light snowfall to heavy mixed precipitation.

- **18:35 hours:** Multiple calls are received by the local emergency services reporting hazardous road conditions on Kauppakatu and Ruotsalanpuro.

- **18:40 hours:** A silver 2020 Toyota Corolla, driven by Mr. Mikko Koskinen, 34, of Ruotsalanpuro 12, proceeds through a stop sign on Ruotsalanpuro, failing to yield to oncoming traffic on Kauppakatu due to reduced visibility from the heavy snow and rain.

- **18:41 hours:** The Corolla collides with a grey 2018 Volkswagen Passat, driven by Ms. Anna Pitkänen, 29, of Kauppakatu 56, who was travelling towards the intersection at moderate speed. The impact causes the Passat to spin, striking two additional vehicles.

- **18:42-18:44 hours:** A chain reaction ensues as six more vehicles, including a red Ford Fiesta (driven by Mr. Jari Lehtinen), a blue Opel Astra (driven by Ms. Laura Mäkelä), a white Honda Civic (driven by Mr. Olli Virtanen), a black BMW 3 Series (driven by Ms. Sanna Kivinen), a green Ford Focus (driven by Mr. Timo Hiltunen), and a yellow Dacia Logan (driven by Ms. Kaisa Rantala), become involved in the collision, either by attempting to avoid the initial crashes or being struck as they entered the intersection.

- **18:45 hours:** Emergency services are alerted, and they arrive at the scene to find a chaotic mix of overturned vehicles, minor injuries among drivers and passengers, and extensive property damage. All parties involved are accounted for, with minor injuries reported.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The roads were wet from the ongoing precipitation, compounded by a layer of fresh snow that had fallen over the past hour. This combination significantly reduced traction and visibility, contributing to the severity of the collisions. Local authorities were unprepared for such rapid weather changes, leading to an absence of road treatment measures like salt or grit that could have mitigated the hazardous conditions.

**Vehicle Details and Damage:**

1. **Toyota Corolla (Mikko Koskinen):** Front-end damage, airbags deployed.  
2. **Volkswagen Passat (Anna Pitkänen):** Significant side panel damage, rear wheel misaligned.  
3. **Ford Fiesta (Jari Lehtinen):** Rear bumper struck, minor cosmetic damage.  
4. **Opel Astra (Laura Mäkelä):** Front grille collapsed, airbag deployed.  
5. **Honda Civic (Olli Virtanen):** Driver's side door severely dented, passenger-side airbag triggered.  
6. **BMW 3 Series (Sanna Kivinen):** Rear quarter panel crumpled, minor whiplash injury to the driver.  
7. **Ford Focus (Timo Hiltunen):** Minor frontal scuffing, no airbag deployment.  
8. **Dacia Logan (Kaisa Rantala):** Rear end struck, no significant damage or injuries.

**Witness Statements:**

Several pedestrians and occupants of nearby buildings provided consistent accounts corroborating the sequence of events. Notably, Ms. Eeva Soini from Kauppakatu 30 reported seeing the Corolla run the stop sign just before the collisions began.

**Conclusion:**

This incident underscores the critical importance of vigilance and preparedness in adverse weather conditions. While no single factor can be pinpointed as solely responsible, the combination of driver error exacerbated by unforeseen weather led to this multi-vehicle collision. Local authorities are reminded to enhance their weather monitoring and response protocols to prevent similar occurrences in future.
