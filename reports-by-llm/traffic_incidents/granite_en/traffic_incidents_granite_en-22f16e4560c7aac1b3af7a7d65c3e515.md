*Incident Number:* 230818-RAU-001  
*Date of Incident:* 18 August 2023

*Reporting Officer:* Inspector Jari Hietala

**Narrative:**

On the afternoon of 18 August 2023, at approximately 14:30 hours, a two-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Metsäntie in the municipality of Rautavaara, Finland. The incident involved a grey 2019 Toyota Corolla, registered with the license plate 345-ABC, driven by Mr. Olli Mäki, a 47-year-old local resident of Metsäntie 12, and a silver 2020 Ford Focus, registered with the license plate 678-DEF, operated by Ms. Kaisa Pitkänen, a 32-year-old resident of Kauppakatu 56.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **14:20 hours:** Ms. Pitkänen, driving the Ford Focus, approached the intersection from the south on Kauppakatu heading north. Mr. Mäki, in the Toyota Corolla, was waiting at a red light on Metsäntie intending to turn left onto Kauppakatu.
- **14:25 hours:** The traffic signal turned green for both vehicles. As Ms. Pitkänen proceeded cautiously through the intersection, Mr. Mäki initiated his left turn without yielding to oncoming traffic, misjudging the speed and proximity of Ms. Pitkänen's vehicle.
- **14:26 hours:** The front passenger side of the Ford Focus collided with the driver’s side of the Toyota Corolla. Both vehicles sustained damage; the Corolla's side panel was scraped, and the Focus's front bumper was dented.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

At the time of the incident, a thunderstorm was actively affecting the area. Heavy rainfall reduced visibility, and lightning strikes in close proximity caused temporary power outages, leading to the malfunction of several traffic signals, including the one at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Metsäntie. The wet road surface compounded the risk of skidding, contributing to the severity of the collision.

**Witness Statements:**

A passerby, Mr. Jussi Rantala, who was walking his dog along Metsäntie, reported observing the events leading up to the crash. He stated that both drivers appeared distracted, with Ms. Pitkänen checking her phone briefly before proceeding and Mr. Mäki seemingly rushing to make the turn.

**Damage Assessment:**

The Toyota Corolla sustained damage primarily to its driver's side, including a scraped paint and a bent door. The Ford Focus incurred damage to its front bumper, with visible indentation and paint transfer from the Corolla. Both vehicles were towed from the scene for repair assessments.

**Action Taken:**

Both drivers were issued citations for failing to yield right of way and for driving under adverse weather conditions without due caution. Emergency services, including the local fire department and paramedics, responded promptly but found no injuries among the drivers or passengers. The scene was cleared by 15:30 hours, with road maintenance crews addressing the malfunctioning traffic signal and clearing debris.
