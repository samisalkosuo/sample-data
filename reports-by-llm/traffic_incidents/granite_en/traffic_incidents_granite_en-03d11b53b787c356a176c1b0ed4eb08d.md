**Narrative:**

On the evening of 11 July 2023, at approximately 21:45 hours, a two-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ruotsalanpuro in Mynämäki, Finland. The incident involved a grey 2018 Volvo V60, registered with the license plate 34-VLO-12, driven by Mr. Petteri Koskinen, a 35-year-old local resident of Kauppakatu 12, and a white 2020 Ford Focus, registered with the license plate 23-FCO-98, operated by Ms. Anna-Liisa Pitkänen, a 27-year-old residing at Ruotsalanpuro 45.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **21:30 hours:** Ms. Pitkänen departed her residence on Ruotsalanpuro heading east towards the intersection intending to turn left onto Kauppakatu.  
- **21:32 hours:** Mr. Koskinen, traveling west on Kauppakatu in his Volvo, approached the intersection. Visibility was compromised due to mixed snow and rain, reducing road visibility to approximately 50 meters.  
- **21:34 hours:** Ms. Pitkänen initiated her left turn without yielding to oncoming traffic, failing to notice Mr. Koskinen's vehicle approaching from the opposite direction.  
- **21:35 hours:** The front passenger side of Mr. Koskinen’s Volvo collided with the driver's side of Ms. Pitkänen’s Ford Focus, resulting in significant damage to both vehicles.  

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The prevailing weather conditions at the time of the incident were mixed snow and rain, which contributed to poor visibility and slippery road surfaces. The Finnish Meteorological Institute reported light snowfall interspersed with periods of heavy rain, reducing traction and increasing the risk of skidding.

**Vehicle Damage:**

- **Volvo V60 (34-VLO-12):** Sustained substantial damage to the passenger front side, including a crumpled fender, damaged headlight, and scrapes along the door. Airbag deployment was noted, indicating occupant restraint during the impact.
- **Ford Focus (23-FCO-98):** Experienced significant damage to the driver's side, with a dented front panel, broken headlight, and deformation of the passenger door. The airbag in the driver’s seat had deployed.

**Witnesses:**

Two independent witnesses corroborated the sequence of events. Mr. Jari Pekkarinen, residing at Kauppakatu 20, reported seeing Ms. Pitkänen initiate her turn without checking for oncoming traffic. Ms. Leena Rantanen from Ruotsalanpuro 30 confirmed observing the collision and noted the slippery road conditions.

**Immediate Actions:**

Upon receiving the call, Mynämäki Police arrived at the scene within seven minutes. Emergency medical services were dispatched, attending to both drivers who reported minor injuries. Traffic was diverted, and the area was secured for investigation. Both vehicles were towed to a nearby garage for detailed examination.

**Preliminary Conclusion:**

The collision appears to be a result of driver error, specifically failure to yield right-of-way during a left turn, compounded by adverse weather conditions affecting visibility and road grip. Further investigation, including CCTV footage review and vehicle black box analysis, is underway to ascertain full details and determine liability.
