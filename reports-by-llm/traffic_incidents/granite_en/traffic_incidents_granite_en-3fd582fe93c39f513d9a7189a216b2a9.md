**Traffic Incident Report**

*Incident Number:* 2024-PUO-0613  
*Date of Incident:* 13 June 2024  
*Location:* Intersection of Kauppakatu and Ruotsalanpuro, Puolanka, Finland  
*Reporting Officer:* Inspector Jouko Mäkelä, Puolanka Police Department  

**Narrative:**

On the morning of 13 June 2024, at approximately 08:45 hours, a two-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ruotsalanpuro in the municipality of Puolanka, Finland. The incident involved a grey 2019 Toyota Corolla, registered with the license plate '345-ABC', driven by Mr. Mikko Hietala, a 38-year-old local resident, and a white 2020 Ford Focus, identified by its license plate '789-DEF', operated by Ms. Anna Kaski, a 25-year-old residing in the neighbouring town of Viipuri.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **08:30 hours:** Mixed snow and rain began to fall in Puolanka, creating slippery road conditions on Kauppakatu and Ruotsalanpuro. Visibility was reduced due to the precipitation mixing with lingering snow from earlier weather events.
- **08:40 hours:** Mr. Hietala, driving his Toyota Corolla eastward along Kauppakatu towards its intersection with Ruotsalanpuro, approached the designated stop line. Ms. Kaski, in her Ford Focus, was travelling north on Ruotsalanpuro, preparing to turn left onto Kauppakatu.
- **08:45 hours:** As Mr. Hietala proceeded through the intersection, Ms. Kaski initiated her left turn without yielding to oncoming traffic, as required by Finnish road rules. The front passenger side of Ms. Kaski's vehicle collided with the driver’s side front of Mr. Hietala's Corolla.
- **08:46 hours:** Both vehicles came to a stop, partially blocking the intersection. Witnesses, including Ms. Leena Rantanen who was walking her dog nearby, immediately called emergency services.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The mixed snow and rain significantly reduced visibility and created hazardous road conditions. The precipitation had accumulated unevenly on the roads, forming patches of slush and compacted snow, contributing to the loss of traction for both drivers.

**Vehicle Damage:**

- Mr. Hietala's Toyota Corolla sustained damage primarily to its front passenger side, including a dented door, a cracked headlight, and scrapes along the side panel.
- Ms. Kaski's Ford Focus incurred damage to its left front quarter panel, with a bent fender, scratches on the paintwork, and a minor misalignment of the front wheel.

**Witnesses:**

Ms. Leena Rantanen, a 42-year-old resident of Kauppakatu, provided a statement confirming that Ms. Kaski had not activated her turn signal prior to initiating her left turn and that she appeared distracted by a mobile device moments before the collision.

**Conclusion:**

The collision was primarily caused by Ms. Kaski's failure to yield right of way while turning left, exacerbated by adverse weather conditions. Mr. Hietala was found to be driving within the speed limit and had not contributed to the incident through negligence or violation of traffic laws.
