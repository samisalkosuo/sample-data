**Narrative:**

On the evening of 07.04.2023, at approximately 18:15 hours, a four-vehicle traffic incident occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Mestijärveniemeenkuja in Rautjärvi, Finland. The primary contributing factors were light rain conditions and potential driver distraction.

The sequence of events unfolded as follows:

1. **Initial Positioning:** At the time of the incident, Mr. Mikko Hietala, 34, a local resident driving a blue 2018 Volvo V60 with Finnish license plate 123-AB-45, was proceeding northbound on Kauppakatu approaching the intersection. Ms. Anna Pitkäranta, 29, traveling in her red 2016 Ford Focus (license plate 678-XY-90), was heading eastbound along Mestijärveniemeenkuja, intending to turn left onto Kauppakatu.

2. **Approaching Intersection:** As Ms. Pitkäranta prepared to make her left turn, she momentarily glanced at her mobile device, missing the approaching traffic signal change from amber to red. Meanwhile, Mr. Hietala, although maintaining a lawful speed for the conditions, was distracted by adjusting his GPS settings.

3. **Collision Sequence:** Upon noticing Ms. Pitkäranta's stalled vehicle in the intersection, Mr. Hietala applied brakes but was unable to prevent collision due to the wet road surface compounded by light rain. His Volvo struck the passenger side of Ms. Pitkäranta’s Focus, pushing it further into the intersection.

4. **Secondary Impacts:** The force of the initial impact caused Ms. Pitkäranta's car to spin, colliding with a third vehicle, a white 2019 Toyota Corolla driven by Mr. Jari Kivinen, 45 (license plate 345-UV-67), traveling westbound on Mestijärveniemeenkuja. The Corolla was pushed into the pedestrian crosswalk where Ms. Leena Rautiainen, 62, was waiting to cross, causing minor injuries as she was struck by debris from the collision.

**Vehicle Damage:**
- Volvo V60: Significant damage to the passenger side, airbags deployed.
- Ford Focus: Heavy frontal and side damage, rear end crumpled upon impact with Corolla.
- Toyota Corolla: Moderate frontal damage, minor dent on driver's side.

**Witnesses:**
- Mr. Olli Mäkelä, a passerby, provided a statement confirming the sequence of events and Ms. Pitkäranta’s brief distraction.

**Weather Conditions:** Light rain was reported, contributing to reduced visibility and slippery road conditions. No severe weather warnings were in effect at the time.

**Conclusion:** The incident appears to be a result of driver distraction compounded by adverse weather conditions leading to a chain reaction collision. All parties involved sustained minor injuries, and no life-threatening conditions were reported. Traffic diversions were implemented temporarily while the scene was cleared.
