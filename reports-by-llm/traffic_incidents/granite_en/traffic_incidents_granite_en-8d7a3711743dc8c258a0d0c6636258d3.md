3. **Driver C:** Olli Miettinen, 45, living at Kauppakatu 49, Tyrnävä. He was behind the wheel of a grey 2015 Ford Focus with license plate 345-LM-67.
4. **Driver D:** Sanna Rantanen, 30, residing at Ratinauksenkatu 31, Tyrnävä. She was operating a white 2020 Honda Civic, identified by the license plate 987-KJ-12.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **18:10 hours:** Drivers A and B approached the intersection from Kauppakatu, heading north, while Drivers C and D were proceeding east along Ratinauksenkatu.
- **18:12 hours:** As Driver A neared the intersection, Driver B initiated a left turn onto Kauppakatu intending to head south.
- **18:13 hours:** Driver C, following closely behind Driver B, also attempted to turn left onto Kauppakatu, misjudging the distance and speed of oncoming traffic.
- **18:14 hours:** Driver D, traveling east on Ratinauksenkatu, encountered a sudden decrease in visibility due to a parked delivery van obstructing her view. She proceeded cautiously but was unable to halt in time.
- **18:15 hours:** The collision occurred as Driver D's Honda Civic struck the rear of Driver C's Ford Focus, which had slowed down due to the impending left turn of Driver B. Simultaneously, Driver A's Volvo collided with Driver B's Toyota Corolla, sandwiching both vehicles.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The evening was dry but unusually cold for late September in Finland, with temperatures around 8°C. The roads were clear of snow or ice, but the reduced visibility caused by the parked delivery van played a significant role in the chain of events leading to the collision.

**Vehicle Damage:**

- **Volvo V60 (Driver A):** Sustained damage to the front passenger side, including a dented fender and scratches along the door.
- **Toyota Corolla (Driver B):** Significant damage to the rear driver's side, with the trunk lid crumpled and paint transfer evident.
- **Ford Focus (Driver C):** Rear end struck, resulting in a bent bumper and minor frame distortion.
- **Honda Civic (Driver D):** Front end damage, including a crumpled hood and front bumper.

**Witness Statements:**

Several passersby provided statements corroborating the sequence of events. Notably, witness Marko Lehtinen, who was walking his dog on Kauppakatu, reported seeing Driver B initiate the left turn without fully clearing oncoming traffic and described Driver C's reaction as cautious but ultimately insufficient to avoid the collision.

**Conclusion:**

The incident appears to be a result of misjudged distances and reduced visibility due to external factors rather than reckless driving. All drivers involved were cooperative, and no citations were issued at the scene. The vehicles have been towed to a secure location for further inspection and repair. This report will be updated with any additional findings from the vehicle inspections and potential contributing factors such as road design or signage.
