**Narrative:**

On the afternoon of 11th June 2024, at approximately 14:30 hours, a two-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ratinauksenkatu in Uurainen, Finland. The incident involved a grey 2018 Volvo V60, registered with the license plate 123-ABC, driven by Mr. Mikko Kivinen, a 45-year-old local resident, and a white 2020 Toyota Corolla, identified by its license plate number 456-DEF, operated by Ms. Anna Pitk채nen, a 32-year-old resident of nearby Kuopio.

**Timeline of Events:**

1. **14:28 hours:** Mr. Kivinen, driving northbound on Kauppakatu towards the intersection, encountered mixed snow and rain conditions. The road surface was slick due to recent precipitation, reducing visibility and traction.

2. **14:29 hours:** Ms. Pitk채nen, approaching from the east on Ratinauksenkatu, prepared to turn left onto Kauppakatu. She reportedly misjudged the speed of oncoming traffic due to the adverse weather conditions.

3. **14:30 hours:** The collision occurred when Ms. Pitk채nen's Corolla entered the intersection, striking the passenger side of Mr. Kivinen's Volvo. Both vehicles sustained damage; the Volvo's passenger door was significantly dented, and the Corolla's front end exhibited scratches and a bent hood.

**Witness Statements:**

A passerby, Ms. Liisa Rantala, provided a statement confirming that both drivers appeared shaken but uninjured following the incident. She also noted that neither vehicle had activated their hazard lights prior to the collision, suggesting possible confusion amidst the challenging weather conditions.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The prevailing weather at the time of the incident was mixed snow and rain, leading to reduced visibility and slippery road surfaces. These conditions likely contributed to both drivers' misjudgments regarding speed and distance, culminating in the collision.

**Vehicle Information and Damage:**

**Conclusion:**

The collision appears to be a result of misjudgment in intersection navigation exacerbated by adverse weather conditions.

Recommendations include driver education on navigating challenging weather conditions and potential infrastructure improvements to enhance visibility and safety at high-risk intersections in Uurainen.
