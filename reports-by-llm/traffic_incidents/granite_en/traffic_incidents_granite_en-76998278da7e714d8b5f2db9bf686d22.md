**Timeline of Events:**

- At approximately 18:15 hrs, Mr. Rantala and Ms. Hietala approached the intersection simultaneously from perpendicular directions. The windy conditions with gusts, reported at 20 km/h from the northwest, reduced visibility and made road conditions slippery.
- Ms. Mäkelä, in her Toyota Corolla, was the first to enter the intersection, followed closely by Mr. Rantala in his Ford Focus. Their vehicles collided at the crossroads due to the compromised visibility and slippery road conditions.
- Simultaneously, Ms. Kivinen in her Hyundai Tucson and Mr. Mäki in his Nissan Qashqai were approaching from opposite directions on Mäkelänkatu. The impact of the initial collision caused a chain reaction.
- Mr. Koskinen's Honda Civic, traveling eastbound, struck Ms. Rantala’s Ford Focus as it was pushed into his path by the initial collision forces. 
- Ms. Lehtinen's BMW 3 Series, entering from Kauppakatu, collided with Mr. Mäki's Nissan Qashqai, which had been propelled across the intersection.
- Lastly, Ms. Kivinen’s Hyundai Tucson, unable to stop in time, struck the rear of Mr. Koskinen's Honda Civic, exacerbating the damage.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The prevailing weather at the time was windy with gusts, as reported by the Finnish Meteorological Institute. The wind direction was northwesterly, causing minor disruptions to traffic, particularly at intersections where visibility was already compromised due to the evening light fading. Road conditions were slippery, contributing to reduced traction and increased stopping distances for the involved vehicles.

**Vehicle Damage Descriptions:**

1. Toyota Corolla (KY-1234): Front-end damage, including a collapsed front bumper and hood misalignment.
2. Ford Focus (LA-5678): Significant frontal impact, airbags deployed; rear passenger side door damaged from contact with the Hyundai Tucson.
3. Volvo V60 (VO-9101): Rear-end collision damage, affecting the boot and taillights.
4. Honda Civic (HO-2345): Frontal impact, airbags deployed; driver's side door dented from contact with the BMW 3 Series.
5. BMW 3 Series (BM-6789): Minor frontal damage, primarily to the passenger side.
6. Nissan Qashqai (NI-3456): Severe rear-end impact, pushing it across the intersection; driver's side door and rear panel damaged.
7. Hyundai Tucson (HY-7890): Frontal damage to the passenger side, indicating contact with the Nissan Qashqai.

**Injuries:**

All occupants sustained minor injuries, primarily from airbag deployment. Medical assistance was provided on-site by local emergency services, and all parties were transported to Lappajärvi Hospital for evaluation and treatment. No life-threatening conditions were reported.

**Investigation Status:**

The scene was secured, and initial investigations suggest that the primary cause of the collision was the adverse weather condition combined with driver inattention leading to reduced reaction times. All drivers involved are cooperating with the investigation. Further analysis of vehicle data recorders (black boxes) is underway to corroborate witness statements and establish a definitive sequence of events.

**Reporting Officer Notes:**

The incident highlights the importance of vigilance and adaptation to changing weather conditions while driving, especially during twilight hours when visibility naturally diminishes. This report will be updated as further evidence and witness interviews are conducted.
