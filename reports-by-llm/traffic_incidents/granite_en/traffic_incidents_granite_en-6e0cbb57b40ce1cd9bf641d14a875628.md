*Incident Number:* 2024-JOT-001  
*Date of Incident:* 01.03.2024  
*Location:* Intersection of Kauppakatu and Ruotsalanpuro, Joutsa, Finland  
*Reporting Officer:* Inspector Markus Hietala, Joutsa Police Department  

**Narrative:**

On the evening of 01.03.2024, at approximately 18:15 hours, a two-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ruotsalanpuro in Joutsa, Finland. The vehicles involved were a grey 2019 Toyota Corolla, registered with the license plate 34-JOT-12, driven by Mr. Jari Pitkäranta, a 38-year-old local resident of Kauppakatu 23, and a silver 2020 Ford Focus, registered with the license plate 78-JOT-91, operated by Ms. Anna-Liisa Koskinen, a 25-year-old resident of Ruotsalanpuro 15.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **18:00 hours:** Ms. Koskinen was driving westbound on Ruotsalanpuro approaching the intersection with Kauppakatu. Mr. Pitkäranta, traveling northbound on Kauppakatu, prepared to turn left onto Ruotsalanpuro.
- **18:05 hours:** Ms. Koskinen reduced her speed as she neared the stop sign at Ruotsalanpuro and Kauppakatu, in accordance with traffic regulations.
- **18:10 hours:** Mr. Pitkäranta, having waited for a moment to ensure safe passage, proceeded his left turn onto Ruotsalanpuro.
- **18:15 hours:** Ms. Koskinen's Ford Focus collided with the passenger side of Mr. Pitkäranten's Toyota Corolla as she continued through the stop sign, failing to yield the right of way. The impact caused significant damage to both vehicles, particularly the passenger door and rear quarter panel of the Corolla, and the front end of the Focus.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The incident occurred during mixed snow and rain conditions. The roads were wet from recent precipitation, with patches of slush and compacted snow, contributing to reduced traction and visibility. These adverse weather conditions likely played a role in Ms. Koskinen's failure to observe Mr. Pitkäranta's vehicle as he initiated his turn.

**Witness Statements:**

A passerby, Mr. Teppo Mäkelä, provided a statement confirming that both vehicles were moving at moderate speeds and that Ms. Koskinen appeared to have misjudged the distance and Mr. Pitkäranten's intent to turn. Another witness, Ms. Laura Hietala, corroborated the account, noting that neither driver exhibited any erratic behavior prior to the collision.

**Damage Description:**

The Toyota Corolla sustained damage predominantly to its passenger side, including a dented door, scrapes along the side panel, and a damaged rear quarter panel. The Ford Focus incurred front-end damage, affecting the hood, grille, and headlight assembly. Both vehicles were towed from the scene by a local wrecker service for further examination and repair.

**Medical Response:**

Both drivers sustained minor injuries and were transported to the Joutsa Central Hospital for evaluation. No passengers were involved in this incident.

**Investigation Status:**

The investigation is ongoing, with a focus on determining contributing factors such as driver error exacerbated by weather conditions. Both drivers have been cited for traffic violations related to failure to yield and driving in hazardous conditions. Further analysis of vehicle data recorders (black boxes) will be conducted to supplement the investigation.
