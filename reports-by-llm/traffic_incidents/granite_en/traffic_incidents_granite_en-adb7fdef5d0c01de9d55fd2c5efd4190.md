**Narrative:**

On the evening of 30 April 2025, at approximately 18:45 hours, a two-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ruotsalanpuro in the municipality of Ilomantsi, Finland. The incident involved a grey 2019 Toyota Corolla, driven by Mr. Mikko Koskinen, age 34, residing at Kauppakatu 123, and a silver 2020 Ford Focus, operated by Ms. Sanna Pitkänen, age 28, from Ruotsalanpuro 456.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **18:30 hours:** Overcast weather conditions prevailed, with reduced visibility and a damp road surface due to intermittent light rainfall over the preceding hour.

- **18:35 hours:** Ms. Pitkänen, driving westbound on Ruotsalanpuro, approached the stop sign at its intersection with Kauppakatu. Mr. Koskinen, traveling southbound on Kauppakatu, was approximately 200 meters away from the intersection.

- **18:40 hours:** Ms. Pitkänen, having stopped at the stop sign, proceeded to cross Kauppakatu. Mr. Koskinen, maintaining a speed of about 50 km/h in a 50 km/h zone, continued his journey.

- **18:42 hours:** The vehicles collided at the intersection. Ms. Pitkänen's Ford Focus struck the passenger side of Mr. Koskinen's Toyota Corolla. The impact caused significant damage to both vehicles; the Corolla sustained a dented passenger door and a cracked headlight, while the Focus received substantial front-end damage, including a collapsed front fender and a damaged hood.

**Witnesses:**

Two pedestrians, Mr. Jussi Rantala and Ms. Anna Lehtinen, witnessed the incident from adjacent properties on Kauppakatu and provided statements confirming that Ms. Pitkänen had stopped at the stop sign before proceeding. They also noted the overcast conditions affecting visibility.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The overcast skies and light rain contributed to reduced visibility, potentially impairing both drivers' ability to perceive each other's approach clearly. The road surface was damp but not icy, which affected tire grip and braking distances.

**Vehicles Involved:**

1. **Toyota Corolla**  
   - License Plate: 123-ILM  
   - Driver: Mikko Koskinen  
   - Damage: Passenger side dent, cracked headlight  

2. **Ford Focus**  
   - License Plate: 789-ILM  
   - Driver: Sanna Pitkänen  
   - Damage: Collapsed front fender, damaged hood  

**Conclusion:**

The collision appears to have resulted from a failure by Ms. Pitkänen to yield the right of way at the stop sign, compounded by the adverse weather conditions affecting visibility. Mr. Koskinen was not speeding and had the right of way. No serious injuries were reported, with both drivers and passengers sustaining minor cuts and bruises. The vehicles have been towed to a secure location for further investigation and potential insurance claims.
