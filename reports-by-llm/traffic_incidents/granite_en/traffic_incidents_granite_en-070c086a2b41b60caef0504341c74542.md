On the evening of 25th June 2024, at approximately 18:30 hours, a two-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ruotsalanpuro in the municipality of Joutsa, Finland.

**Timeline of Events:**

1. **18:20 hours**: Mr. Pitkänen, driving his Toyota Corolla from west to east along Kauppakatu towards the intersection with Ruotsalanpuro, approached the stop line. Ms. Koskinen, in her Ford Focus, was travelling south on Ruotsalanpuro, preparing to cross Kauppakatu.

3. **18:28 hours**: As Mr. Pitkänen proceeded through the intersection after stopping, Ms. Koskinen allegedly failed to yield the right of way, turning left directly into the path of the Toyota Corolla. The front passenger side of the Ford Focus collided with the driver's side front of the Toyota Corolla.

Airbag deployment was noted, indicating occupant restraint during the collision. The Ford Focus also showed considerable damage on its left front, with a bent hood and scrapes along the driver's side.

Mr. Pitkänen reported minor injuries consistent with airbag deployment, primarily whiplash. Ms. Koskinen was uninjured but visibly shaken. Both were transported to Joutsa Central Hospital for evaluation and treatment as a precautionary measure.

**Further Investigation:**
