**Narrative:**

On the night of 06.06.2024, at approximately 23:15 hours, a two-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ratinkatu in the municipality of Sotkamo, Finland. The drivers involved were identified as Mikko Pietilä, 34, a local baker residing at 22 Aurora Avenue, and Jari Kivinen, 41, a carpenter from 45 Oak Street.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **23:08 hours:** Mikko Pietilä, driving his 2018 Volvo V60 with Finnish license plate 123-AB-45, was proceeding southbound on Kauppakatu towards the intersection. Jari Kivinen, operating a 2016 Ford Focus with Finnish license plate 678-XY-90, was traveling westbound on Ratinkatu approaching the same intersection.

- **23:14 hours:** Both drivers were within their right to proceed, given the green traffic signals. However, icy road conditions, exacerbated by intermittent light snowfall, reduced traction and visibility.

- **23:15 hours:** As Pietilä's Volvo entered the intersection intending to turn left onto Ratinkatu, Kivinen's Ford, following the traffic signal, continued straight through. The front passenger side of Kivinen’s vehicle collided with the driver's side of Pietilä's car.

**Witness Statements:**

A passerby, Ms. Aino Mäkelä, a retired teacher residing at 33 Maple Lane, witnessed the incident and confirmed that both drivers applied their brakes but due to the icy roads, skidded into the collision. She also noted that neither driver appeared to have attempted an evasive maneuver in time.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The night was clear with intermittent light snowfall, reducing visibility. The temperature was just above freezing, causing icy conditions on the roads. These conditions were reported by weather station SOT-01 located approximately 5 kilometers from the incident site at 23:10 hours, recording a road surface temperature of -0.2°C.

**Vehicle Damage:**

Pietilä's Volvo sustained significant damage to its passenger side, including a crumpled front fender and a dented door. Kivinen’s Ford also showed damage to its driver's side, with a bent hood and scrapes along the passenger door. Both vehicles were towed from the scene by Viking Towing Services.

**Conclusion:**

The collision was attributed to the adverse weather conditions, specifically icy roads, which impaired both drivers' ability to maintain control of their vehicles. No criminal negligence or traffic violations were identified, and no injuries were reported among the drivers or passengers. Both parties were advised to adjust their driving behaviors in response to prevailing weather conditions.
