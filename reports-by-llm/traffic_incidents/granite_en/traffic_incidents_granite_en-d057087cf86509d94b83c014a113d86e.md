**Traffic Incident Report**

*Incident Number:* 230101-KAJ-001  
*Date of Incident:* 01 January 2023  
*Location:* Intersection of Kauppakatu and Yli-Kangas, Kajaani, Finland  
*Reporting Officer:* Inspector Jouko Hietala, Kajaani Police Department  

**Narrative:**

On the morning of 01 January 2023, at approximately 08:45, a two-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Yli-Kangas in Kajaani. The vehicles involved were a silver 2019 Toyota Corolla, registered with the license plate 67-AJK-12, driven by Mr. Mikko Koskinen, 34, of Kauppakatu 56, and a blue 2020 Ford Focus, registered with the license plate 89-KAJ-34, operated by Ms. Anna Pitkänen, 27, of Yli-Kangas 19.

Witnesses at the scene, including Mr. Jari Lehtinen and Ms. Sanna Rantala, reported that both vehicles were traveling in a northerly direction on Kauppakatu before reaching the intersection with Yli-Kangas. The Toyota Corolla, driven by Mr. Koskinen, was first to approach the stop line at the intersection, where it came to a complete stop, as required by traffic signals. Ms. Pitkänen, driving the Ford Focus, was following behind at a safe distance and also observed the stop signal.

As the traffic light turned green for northerly traffic, both drivers proceeded cautiously into the intersection. However, Ms. Pitkänen alleged that she noticed an unexpected obstacle in her lane—a pothole, partially concealed by fresh snow—which caused her vehicle to swerve slightly towards the right. This maneuver led to a collision with the passenger side of Mr. Koskinen's Corolla as it continued straight through the intersection.

**Timeline of Events:**

- 08:40 - Both vehicles approach the intersection of Kauppakatu and Yli-Kangas, observing the red traffic signal.
- 08:42 - Traffic light turns green for northerly traffic.
- 08:43 - Mr. Koskinen's Corolla begins to move forward, coming to a complete stop at the stop line.
- 08:44 - Ms. Pitkänen's Focus follows, but encounters an unnoticed pothole, causing her to swerve right.
- 08:45 - Collision occurs as Ms. Pitkänen's vehicle makes contact with the passenger side of Mr. Koskinen's Corolla.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The morning was clear and dry, with temperatures around -5°C. Although there had been recent snowfall, the roads were treated with salt, reducing icy conditions. However, fresh snow cover on the sides of Kauppakatu concealed hazards such as the pothole that contributed to the incident.

**Vehicle Damage:**

The passenger-side door and fender of Mr. Koskinen's Corolla sustained significant damage from impact, requiring professional repair. Ms. Pitkänen's Focus also suffered damage to its right front fender and headlight, though less severe compared to the Corolla.

**Conclusion:**

The collision was primarily caused by an unforeseen road hazard—a pothole obscured by snow—which led to Ms. Pitkänen losing control momentarily. Both drivers adhered to traffic regulations prior to the incident, and no citations were issued. The report is submitted for insurance purposes, and further investigation into road maintenance practices in the area has been initiated.
