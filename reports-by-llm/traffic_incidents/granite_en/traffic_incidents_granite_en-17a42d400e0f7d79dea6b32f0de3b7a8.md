**Traffic Incident Report**

*Incident Number:* 2024-EUR-0907  
*Date of Incident:* 07.09.2024  
*Location:* Eurajoki, Finland  
*Reporting Officer:* Inspector Jouko Hietala  

**Narrative:**

On the night of 07.09.2024, at approximately 23:15 hours, a two-vehicle collision occurred on Kauppakatu, a primary thoroughfare in Eurajoki. The incident involved a silver 2018 Toyota Corolla, registered with the license plate 123-ABC, driven by Mr. Mikko Koskinen, 34, of nearby Kangasvägen 12, and a black 2020 Volvo S60, bearing the license plate 456-DEF, operated by Ms. Anna Pitkänen, 29, residing at Linnunlaulujärvenkatu 3.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **23:10 hours:** Mr. Koskinen was driving westbound on Kauppakatu towards the town center after leaving his workplace. Ms. Pitkänen, traveling eastbound, approached from the opposite direction.

- **23:14 hours:** As Ms. Pitkänen neared the intersection with Metsäkatu, she noticed a pedestrian, Mr. Jussi Lehtinen, 45, of Kauppakatu 56, crossing the street outside the designated crosswalk. To avoid a potential collision, Ms. Pitkänen applied her brakes sharply, causing her vehicle to skid on the dry but cold asphalt due to the nighttime conditions.

- **23:15 hours:** Mr. Koskinen, following too closely behind Ms. Pitkänen's Volvo, was unable to react in time and collided with the rear of her vehicle. The impact pushed Ms. Pitkänen’s car into the pedestrian, Mr. Lehtinen, who sustained minor injuries from the impact.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The weather on the night of the incident was clear but cold, with temperatures around 5°C. The roads were dry, contributing to the vehicle skidding observed during Ms. Pitkänen's emergency braking maneuver. There were no adverse weather conditions such as rain or ice that could have exacerbated the situation.

**Vehicle Damage:**

- Mr. Koskinen’s Toyota Corolla sustained significant damage to its front bumper and hood, with visible indentation from impact. Airbag deployment was noted, indicating a forceful collision.

- Ms. Pitkänen's Volvo S60 showed rear-end damage, including a crumpled trunk lid and taillights. The vehicle also had skid marks evident on the road surface, consistent with emergency braking.

**Witnesses:**

A passerby, Ms. Laura Rantanen, 27, of Kauppakatu 89, witnessed the incident and provided a statement confirming that Mr. Lehtinen was crossing outside the crosswalk when Ms. Pitkänen initiated her evasive action.

**Conclusion:**

The collision resulted from a chain of events beginning with a pedestrian entering the road unexpectedly, prompting one driver to perform an emergency stop. The subsequent rear-end collision was attributed to Mr. Koskinen's failure to maintain a safe following distance. No criminal charges were filed, but Mr. Koskinen received a traffic violation for following too closely. Both drivers and the pedestrian sought medical attention as a precaution, with Mr. Lehtinen being treated for minor bruises.
