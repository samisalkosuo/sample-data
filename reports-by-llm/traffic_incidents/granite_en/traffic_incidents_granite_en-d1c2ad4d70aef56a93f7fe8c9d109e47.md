**Narrative:**

On the morning of 10th October 2024, at approximately 08:35 hours, a three-vehicle traffic incident occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ruotsalanpuro in Pyhäranta. The vehicles involved were a grey 2019 Toyota Corolla, registered KY-12345, driven by Mr. Mikko Koskinen, 38, of Kauppakatu 12, Pyhäranta; a silver 2020 Volvo XC60, registered VO-67890, operated by Ms. Sanna Pitkänen, 42, residing at Ruotsalanpuro 56, Pyhäranta; and a black 2017 Ford Focus, identified as FI-23456, driven by Mr. Jussi Laine, 29, from Kauppakatu 34, Pyhäranta.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **08:28 hours:** Ms. Pitkänen, driving the Volvo XC60, approached the intersection on Ruotsalanpuro heading north, intending to turn left onto Kauppakatu. Mr. Laine in the Ford Focus was traveling south on Kauppakatu towards the same intersection.

- **08:30 hours:** Mr. Koskinen, driving the Toyota Corolla, entered the intersection from Ruotsalanpuro, attempting to proceed straight ahead onto Kauppakatu. He failed to yield to oncoming traffic, colliding with the front passenger side of Ms. Pitkänen's Volvo XC60.

- **08:31 hours:** The impact caused Ms. Pitkänen’s vehicle to spin, striking Mr. Laine’s Ford Focus as it continued through the intersection. Both vehicles sustained significant damage, primarily to their front ends.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The morning was characterized by mixed precipitation—light snow interspersed with rain. The roads were wet but not icy, contributing to reduced traction and visibility. The combination of weather conditions and early-morning light made it challenging for drivers to maintain control, particularly at the intersection where visibility was further obstructed by parked vehicles and street furniture.

**Vehicle Damage:**

1. **Toyota Corolla (KY-12345):** The front passenger side sustained substantial damage, including a crumpled fender and a dented door. Airbag deployment was noted, indicating the severity of the impact on this side of the vehicle.

2. **Volvo XC60 (VO-67890):** Significant frontal damage was observed, with the passenger side headlight shattered and the hood misaligned. The vehicle also showed signs of skidding marks, indicating a loss of control post-collision.

3. **Ford Focus (FI-23456):** The front end of Mr. Laine’s car bore heavy impact damage, with the bumper caved in and the grille deformed. There were also scratches along the driver's side, suggesting contact with the Volvo during the spin.

**Witnesses:**

Two pedestrians, Ms. Anna Rautiainen and Mr. Olli Mäkelä, witnessed the incident from a nearby café on Kauppakatu. They provided statements confirming that Mr. Koskinen failed to yield his right of way and that both subsequent collisions occurred as described.

**Action Taken:**

Emergency services were promptly dispatched, arriving at 08:37 hours. All parties involved were transported to the Pyhäranta Health Centre for assessment; fortunately, no serious injuries were reported. The vehicles were towed away for further investigation and repair. Road conditions were cleared, and traffic was rerouted to minimize disruption.

**Investigation Status:**

The investigation is ongoing. Mr. Koskinen is cited for failing to yield the right of way. Further analysis will include review of any available dashcam footage from passing vehicles and examination of vehicle event data recorders (black boxes) to corroborate witness accounts and establish a definitive sequence of events.
