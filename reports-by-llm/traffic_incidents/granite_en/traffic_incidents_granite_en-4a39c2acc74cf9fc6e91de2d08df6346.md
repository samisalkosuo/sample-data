**Traffic Incident Report**

*Incident Number:* 230517-KITE-001  
*Date of Incident:* 17 May 2023  
*Location:* Intersection of Pohjolanpuu and Kauppakatu, Kitee, Finland  
*Reporting Officer:* Inspector Jari Hietala  
*Municipality:* Kitee  

**Narrative:**

On the evening of 17 May 2023, at approximately 18:45 hours, a three-vehicle traffic incident occurred at the intersection of Pohjolanpuu and Kauppakatu in the municipality of Kitee, Finland. The weather was dry but unusually cold for the time of year, with temperatures around 6°C.

The vehicles involved were a silver 2019 Toyota Corolla, registered as FIN-123XY, driven by Mr. Mikko Koskinen, 34, residing at Pohjolanpuutie 45, Kitee; a blue 2020 Ford Focus, registered as FIN-456ZX, driven by Ms. Anna Pietilä, 28, living at Kauppakatu 120, Kitee; and a grey 2017 Volvo V60, registered as FIN-789LM, driven by Mr. Jussi Rantala, 42, residing at Pohjolanpuu 300, Kitee.

According to witness statements and evidence gathered from the scene, Ms. Pietilä was travelling southbound on Kauppakatu approaching the intersection with Pohjolanpuu. Mr. Koskinen, proceeding eastbound on Pohjolanpuu, attempted to turn left onto southbound Kauppakatu. Simultaneously, Mr. Rantala was travelling westbound on Pohjolanpuu and intended to continue straight through the intersection.

It appears that Mr. Koskinen misjudged the speed of oncoming traffic, failing to yield to Ms. Pietilä, who collided with the passenger side of his Toyota Corolla. The impact caused both vehicles to come to a stop in the southern lanes of Kauppakatu. Mr. Rantala, upon seeing the collision unfold, attempted to brake but was unable to avoid striking the rear of Ms. Pietilä's Ford Focus, pushing it further into the Corolla.

**Timeline of Events:**

- 18:40 - All vehicles reportedly travelling within the speed limit for the dry, cold conditions.
- 18:43 - Mr. Koskinen initiates left turn from Pohjolanpuu onto Kauppakatu.
- 18:44 - Ms. Pietilä enters intersection from west on Kauppakatu.
- 18:45 - Collision occurs between Ms. Pietilä's Ford Focus and Mr. Koskinen's Toyota Corolla.
- 18:45 - Mr. Rantala's Volvo V60 collides with the rear of Ms. Pietilä’s vehicle, exacerbating the initial impact.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The roads were dry but unusually cold at 6°C, which may have contributed to reduced visibility and potentially affected driver alertness or reaction times. There is no indication of ice or other hazardous conditions that could have directly caused the incident.

**Vehicle Damage:**

- The Toyota Corolla sustained damage primarily to its passenger side, including a dented door and scratches along the side panel.
- The Ford Focus received significant frontal damage, affecting both driver and passenger sides, with airbag deployment noted.
- The Volvo V60 showed rear impact damage, affecting the boot lid and tail lights.

**Witnesses:**

Two pedestrians, Ms. Leena Koskinen (no relation to the driver) and Mr. Olli Pietilä, provided statements corroborating the sequence of events. They reported that all drivers appeared alert and no signs of erratic driving were observed prior to the collision.

**Investigation Status:**

The investigation is ongoing. All parties have been interviewed, and vehicle data recorders (black boxes) have been secured for analysis. Road conditions and potential contributing factors such as driver fatigue or distraction are under review. Further analysis will determine liability and inform any necessary traffic safety measures in the area.
