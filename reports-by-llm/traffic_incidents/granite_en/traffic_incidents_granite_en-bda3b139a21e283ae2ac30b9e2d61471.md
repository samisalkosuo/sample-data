**Incident Description:**

On the afternoon of 05 February 2025, at approximately 14:30 hours, a multi-vehicle collision occurred on Kauppakatu, a bustling commercial street in Föglö. The incident involved eight vehicles, resulting in various degrees of damage and minor injuries to the occupants.

**Narrative:**

At the time of the incident, 38-year-old local resident, Mikko Koskinen, was driving his 2019 Volvo V60 from west to east along Kauppakatu, heading towards the town centre. As he approached the intersection with Rautatiekatu, a secondary road leading to residential areas, Koskinen reportedly failed to notice the stalled vehicle of 45-year-old Anna Pitkäranta in her 2016 Toyota Corolla, which had come to a halt due to mechanical issues.

Pitkäranta's vehicle was positioned at an angle across both lanes of Kauppakatu, blocking traffic. Following closely behind her was 29-year-old Jussi Rantala in his 2017 Ford Focus, who, unable to stop in time, collided with Pitkäranta's vehicle. The impact propelled Pitkäranta’s car into the oncoming lane, where it was struck by a 52-year-old retiree, Lauri Hietala, driving his 2015 Nissan Qashqai eastbound.

Meanwhile, three additional vehicles were caught in the ensuing chaos. A 34-year-old delivery driver, Sami Lehtinen, operating a 2020 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter van for local logistics company 'Arctic Express,' was attempting to navigate around the stalled cars and collided with Hietala’s vehicle. Simultaneously, a 67-year-old pedestrian, Eeva Kivinen, stepped off the sidewalk near a crossing on Rautatiekatu to avoid a group of children playing, unaware of the approaching vehicles. She was struck by Lehtinen's van as it swerved to avoid Hietala’s car.

The final two vehicles involved were a 23-year-old student, Oona Mäkelä, driving her mother's 2018 Honda Civic, who was attempting to turn right onto Kauppakatu from Rautatiekatu and collided with the rear of Lehtinen’s van, and a 49-year-old passenger, Marko Virtanen, who was in the back seat of Mäkelä's car during the impact.

**Timeline:**

1. 14:28 - Anna Pitkäranta's Toyota Corolla stalls on Kauppakatu near Rautatiekatu.
2. 14:30 - Jussi Rantala in Ford Focus fails to notice the stalled vehicle and collides with it from behind.
3. 14:31 - Lauri Hietala in Nissan Qashqai, impacted by Rantala’s car, is pushed into oncoming traffic.
4. 14:32 - Sami Lehtinen in Mercedes-Benz Sprinter attempts to maneuver around the incident, striking Hietala's vehicle and later Eeva Kivinen as she steps onto the road.
5. 14:33 - Oona Mäkelä in Honda Civic attempts a right turn onto Kauppakatu, colliding with Lehtinen’s van.
6. 14:34 - Marko Virtanen, passenger in Mäkelä's vehicle, sustains minor injuries from the impact.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The weather on the day of the incident was clear and sunny with no adverse conditions reported that could have contributed to the accident, aside from potential glare from the sun affecting visibility for some drivers. The road surface was dry, providing adequate traction. However, the sudden halt of Pitkäranta's vehicle due to mechanical failure caught other drivers off guard, leading to the chain reaction of collisions.

**Vehicle Details and Damage:**

1. Mikko Koskinen’s Volvo V60: Front-end damage, airbags deployed.
2. Anna Pitkäranta’s Toyota Corolla: Heavy frontal and side damage, immobilized.
3. Lauri Hietala’s Nissan Qashqai: Rear-end damage, airbags deployed.
4. Sami Lehtinen’s Mercedes-Benz Sprinter: Significant rear-end damage, minor frontal impact from Kivinen.
5. Eeva Kivinen (pedestrian): Minor injuries, treated at the scene.
6. Oona Mäkelä’s Honda Civic: Rear-end damage, airbags deployed.
7. Marko Virtanen (passenger): Minor injuries, transported to a nearby hospital for evaluation.
8. Jussi Rantala’s Ford Focus: Frontal damage, airbags deployed.

**Witness Statements:**

Several witnesses were present at the scene, including passersby and individuals from nearby businesses. They corroborated the sequence of events described above, noting that while the weather was clear, the sudden stop of Pitkäranta's vehicle seemed to be the initial trigger for the chain reaction.

**Investigation Outcome:**

The investigation is ongoing to determine liability and potential charges. All drivers involved have been cooperative, and preliminary findings suggest that while some may bear more responsibility due to failing to maintain a safe following distance or attention, contributing factors such as vehicle malfunction (Pitkäranta's stalled car) are also under scrutiny.
