**Timeline of Events:**

- **11:30 PM:** Ms. Pietilä departed her residence on Ruotsalanpuro, heading east towards the intersection with Kauppakatu intending to turn left. Mr. Koskinen was traveling west on Kauppakatu, en route from his workplace to home.
- **11:38 PM:** As Ms. Pietilä approached the intersection, fog began to roll in, reducing visibility significantly. She maintained her speed, adhering to the 50 km/h speed limit, but was unaware that Mr. Koskinen's vehicle was nearing the intersection from her right.
- **11:42 PM:** With reduced visibility due to fog, Mr. Koskinen failed to notice Ms. Pietilä's vehicle preparing to turn left. He continued at a speed of approximately 55 km/h, exceeding the limit by 5 km/h.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The prevailing weather condition at the time was foggy, with visibility reduced to approximately 50 meters. The road surface was dry but slick from the fog, contributing to the drivers' difficulty in maintaining control. Emergency services reported that the fog had lifted by 12:15 AM, aiding in post-incident investigations and clearance.

**Summary:**

This report details a two-vehicle collision in Ylöjärvi, Finland, on 23 April 2025, under foggy conditions at night.

Both parties were cooperative during the investigation, and no serious injuries were reported. Further analysis of vehicle data recorders (black boxes) is pending to ascertain precise speeds and braking patterns.
