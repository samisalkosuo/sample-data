**Narrative:**

On the evening of 30 April 2025, at approximately 18:45 hours, a two-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ratinauksenranta in the municipality of Kuhmo, Finland. The incident involved a grey 2019 Toyota Corolla, registered with the license plate 34-KUH-12, driven by Mr. Mikko Kivinen, a 38-year-old local resident, and a silver 2020 Ford Focus, identified by its license plate 78-KUH-91, operated by Ms. Anna Pitkänen, a 25-year-old residing in the adjacent village of Kuopio.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **18:30 hours:** Light rain began falling in Kuhmo, creating slick road conditions on Kauppakatu and Ratinauksenranta.
- **18:40 hours:** Ms. Pitkänen, driving her Ford Focus eastbound on Ratinauksenranta, approached the intersection intending to turn left onto Kauppakatu. Mr. Kivinen, in his Toyota Corolla, was traveling southbound along Kauppakatu towards the same intersection.
- **18:42 hours:** As Ms. Pitkänen entered the intersection, she reportedly misjudged the speed of oncoming traffic due to reduced visibility from the light rain. Her vehicle collided with Mr. Kivinen's Corolla on the passenger side.
- **18:43 hours:** Witnesses, including Ms. Leena Rantala who was waiting at a nearby bus stop, immediately called emergency services.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The prevailing weather condition during the incident was light rain, which contributed to slippery road surfaces. Visibility was moderately reduced, potentially affecting both drivers' perceptions of oncoming traffic.

**Vehicle Damage:**

- The Toyota Corolla, driven by Mr. Kivinen, sustained damage primarily to the passenger side, including a dented door and a broken side mirror.
- The Ford Focus, operated by Ms. Pitkänen, showed significant front-end damage, with the passenger-side headlight shattered and the hood misaligned.

**Witnesses:**

Ms. Leena Rantala, a 22-year-old student residing at Kauppakatu 23, provided a statement confirming her observation of the collision from a nearby bus stop. She noted that both vehicles came to a halt partially blocking the intersection, and neither driver appeared to be under the influence of alcohol or substances.

**Conclusion:**

The collision appears to have resulted from a misjudgment by Ms. Pitkänen regarding the speed and proximity of Mr. Kivinen's vehicle as she executed her left turn. Weather conditions, specifically light rain, likely played a role in reducing visibility and contributing to the incident. No criminal charges are anticipated at this time; however, both drivers have been advised to review their driving practices under adverse weather conditions.
