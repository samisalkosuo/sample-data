**Narrative:**

On the evening of 03.07.2023, at approximately 21:45 hours, a three-vehicle traffic incident occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ruotsalanpuro in the municipality of Jokioinen, Finland. The weather conditions were described as a thunderstorm, with heavy rainfall and reduced visibility due to lightning flashes.

The vehicles involved were operated by the following individuals:
- **Driver A:** Mikael Kuusisto, 34 years old, residing at Kauppakatu 12, Jokioinen. He was driving a blue 2018 Volvo V60 with Finnish license plate 123-ABC.
- **Driver B:** Anna Pitkänen, 27 years old, living at Ruotsalanpuro 5, Jokioinen. She was behind the wheel of a red 2019 Toyota Corolla, bearing license plate 456-DEF.
- **Driver C:** Olli Mäkelä, 48 years old, residing at Kauppakatu 33, Jokioinen. He operated a grey 2020 Ford Focus with the license plate 789-GHI.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **21:40 hours:** Driver A, Mikael Kuusisto, was traveling westbound on Kauppakatu approaching the intersection with Ruotsalanpuro. Driver B, Anna Pitkänen, was proceeding southbound on Ruotsalanpuro towards the same intersection. Driver C, Olli Mäkelä, was heading eastbound on Kauppakatu and also approaching the intersection.

- **21:43 hours:** As Driver A entered the intersection intending to turn left onto Ruotsalanpuro, Driver B, traveling through the intersection, collided with the passenger side of Driver A's vehicle. Simultaneously, Driver C, who was distracted by the thunderstorm, failed to notice the stop sign and proceeded into the intersection, striking the rear of Driver B's vehicle.

- **21:45 hours:** The collision sequence caused significant damage to all three vehicles. Driver A's Volvo sustained substantial side impact damage, while Driver B's Toyota received frontal damage, and Driver C's Ford Focus showed considerable rear-end damage. Fortunately, no passengers were reported in any of the vehicles, and all drivers sustained only minor injuries.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The thunderstorm with heavy rainfall and frequent lightning significantly reduced visibility at the time of the incident. The wet road conditions contributed to the loss of traction for Driver C, exacerbating the rear-end collision.

**Damage Descriptions:**

1. **Volvo V60 (Driver A):** Passenger side suffered crumpled metalwork, shattered window glass, and a deployed airbag. License plate: 123-ABC.
   
2. **Toyota Corolla (Driver B):** Frontal impact resulted in a collapsed front bumper, damaged headlights, and a bent hood. License plate: 456-DEF.

3. **Ford Focus (Driver C):** Rear-end damage included a smashed trunk lid, broken tail lights, and a crumpled boot area. License plate: 789-GHI.

**Witness Statements:**

A passerby, Jari Lehtinen, provided a statement confirming the sequence of events and noting the poor visibility due to the thunderstorm. Another witness, Sanna Rantanen, corroborated Driver C's distraction by the weather conditions just prior to the collision.

**Conclusion:**

The traffic incident was primarily caused by the confluence of adverse weather conditions and driver distractions leading to misjudgments at the intersection. All drivers were cooperative during the investigation, and no citations were issued given the extenuating circumstances. The case is closed with this report.
