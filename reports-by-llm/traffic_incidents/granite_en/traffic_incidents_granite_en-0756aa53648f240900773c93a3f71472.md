**Incident Description:**

On the afternoon of 23rd May 2024, at approximately 14:30 hours, a multi-vehicle collision occurred on Kauppakatu, a major thoroughfare in central Lappeenranta. The incident involved nine vehicles, resulting in various degrees of damage and minor injuries to the occupants.

**Narrative:**

At the time of the incident, Mr. Jari Pitkäranta, 45, a local resident of Kauppakatu 23, was driving his 2018 Volvo V60 eastbound towards the city centre. As he approached the intersection with Mikko-Ahti-Nurmi-laan, Mr. Pitkäranta encountered icy road conditions, causing his vehicle to skid uncontrollably.

Simultaneously, Ms. Anna Kivinen, 32, from nearby Säretie 15, was driving her 2020 Toyota Corolla westbound on Mikko-Ahti-Nurmi-laan. She attempted to navigate the icy intersection but lost control of her vehicle, colliding with Mr. Pitkäranten's Volvo.

The impact sent both vehicles spinning, with the Volvo careening into the path of oncoming traffic. Several following vehicles were unable to stop in time:

1. A 2019 Ford Focus driven by Mr. Mikko Hietala, 27, from Kauppakatu 42, collided with the Volvo.
2. Ms. Laura Soininen, 24, driving her 2017 Nissan Qashqai, was forced to swerve and hit a snowbank before regaining control.
3. Mr. Olli Mäkelä, 58, in his 2021 Hyundai i30, collided with the Nissan Qashqai as it re-entered the roadway.
4. Ms. Kaisa Rantala, 60, driving a 2016 Honda Civic, was unable to avoid a chain reaction and struck Mr. Mäkelä's Hyundai.
5. A 2023 Dacia Sandero, driven by Mr. Jussi Koskinen, 42, from Valtion-puistotie 31, attempted to maneuver around the chaos but clipped a parked vehicle before coming to a stop.
6. Ms. Sanna Lehtinen, 30, in her 2019 Kia Rio, was unable to halt and collided with the Dacia.
7. Lastly, Mr. Teppo Virtanen, 48, driving a 2022 Volkswagen Golf, from Kauppakatu 56, was following closely and could not prevent a collision with Ms. Lehtinen's Kia.

**Witnesses:**

Several pedestrians were present at the nearby bus stop, including Mr. Jussi Pietiläinen and Ms. Helmi Koskinen, who provided statements corroborating the sequence of events.

**Timeline of Events:**

- 14:28 hours: Icy conditions reported on Mikko-Ahti-Nurmi-laan and Kauppakatu by passing Finnish Transport Infrastructure Agency (FMI) inspectors.
- 14:30 hours: Initial collision between Pitkäranten's Volvo and Kivinen's Toyota Corolla at the intersection.
- 14:31-14:32 hours: Subsequent collisions as described above, occurring within a two-minute span due to icy conditions and inadequate reaction times.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The roads were covered with a thin layer of ice, exacerbated by intermittent light snowfall, reducing traction and contributing significantly to the severity of the collisions. Visibility was moderate, with no significant obstructions aside from snow accumulation on road signs.

**Vehicle Details and Damage:**

1. Volvo V60 (Finland's license plate 123-ABC): Heavily damaged on the front passenger side, airbags deployed.
2. Toyota Corolla (456-DEF): Rear-end damage, minor occupant injuries.
3. Ford Focus (GHI-789): Frontal damage, airbags deployed.

7. Dacia Sandero (STU-910): Minor front-end scuffing, no occupant injuries.
8. Kia Rio (VWX-234): Rear bumper damage, minor occupant injuries.
9. Volkswagen Golf (YZA-567): Frontal impact, airbags deployed.

**Summary:**

This incident was a result of hazardous icy road conditions during daylight hours, leading to multiple vehicles losing control and colliding in a chain reaction. All involved parties sustained minor injuries, and damages ranged from minor scuffing to significant structural harm. The Finnish Transport Infrastructure Agency has been notified for potential road treatment measures following this incident.
