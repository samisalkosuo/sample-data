*Date of Incident:* 13 February 2023  
*Location:* Intersection of Onerva Street and Kalevägen, Tammela, Finland  
*Reporting Officer:* Inspector Jouko Hietala, Tammela Police Department  

**Narrative:**

On the evening of 13 February 2023, at approximately 18:45 hours, a two-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Onerva Street and Kalevägen in the municipality of Tammela, Finland. The incident involved a grey 2019 Toyota Corolla, driven by Mr. Mikko Koskinen, age 34, residing at 123 Onerva Street, and a silver 2020 Ford Focus, operated by Ms. Anna Pietilä, age 28, from 456 Kalevägen.

Witnesses, including Mr. Jussi Rantala, a local resident who was walking his dog in the vicinity, reported that both vehicles were travelling towards each other on perpendicular streets during a windy evening with gusts affecting visibility and control. According to witness statements, Mr. Koskinen proceeded through the intersection on a green light without yielding to oncoming traffic, while Ms. Pietilä, distracted by her mobile device, failed to notice the approaching red light.

The front passenger side of the Corolla collided with the driver's side of the Focus, resulting in significant damage to both vehicles. The Corolla sustained a crumpled front end, a shattered headlight, and a dented passenger door. The Focus experienced substantial damage to its driver’s side, including a bent hood, a broken side mirror, and a scraped paintwork along the door.

**Timeline of Events:**

- 18:30 hours: Ms. Pietilä enters her vehicle on Kalevägen and begins her journey towards Onerva Street, engaging with her mobile device.
- 18:40 hours: Mr. Koskinen approaches the intersection from Onerva Street, proceeding through on a green light.
- 18:42 hours: Ms. Pietilä, distracted, fails to observe the red traffic signal and enters the intersection, colliding with Mr. Koskinen's vehicle.
- 18:45 hours: The collision occurs; both drivers disembark their vehicles, visibly shaken but uninjured. They exchange contact and insurance details with the assistance of Mr. Rantala.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The evening was characterized by windy conditions with gusts, reducing visibility and potentially contributing to Ms. Pietilä's inability to perceive the traffic signal. The road surface, although dry, was slick from intermittent rainfall earlier in the day, possibly affecting vehicle control during the collision.

**Vehicle Details:**

- Toyota Corolla: License plate 123-TOY, driven by Mikko Koskinen.
- Ford Focus: License plate 789-FOR, operated by Anna Pietilä.

**Damage Descriptions:**

The Corolla exhibited a crumpled front end, a shattered passenger headlight, and a dented passenger door. The Focus suffered a bent hood, a broken side mirror, and scraped paint along the driver's side door. Both vehicles were towed from the scene for further inspection and repairs.

**Conclusion:**

The collision was primarily caused by Ms. Pietilä's failure to heed the traffic signal due to distraction, compounded by adverse weather conditions affecting visibility. Mr. Koskinen is being cited for potential contributory negligence in not yielding at the intersection. No serious injuries were reported, and all parties involved sought medical evaluation as a precaution. Further investigation will focus on distracted driving implications and possible enhancements to road signage or traffic calming measures at this intersection to prevent future incidents.
