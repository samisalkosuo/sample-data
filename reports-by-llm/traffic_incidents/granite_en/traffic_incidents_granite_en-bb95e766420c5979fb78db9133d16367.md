**Timeline:**

- 18:28 hours: Ms. Pitkänen initiates her left turn from Rantapellonkatu onto Kauppiaselkä, intending to head eastbound towards her residence.
- 18:29 hours: Mr. Hietala, following closely behind Ms. Pitkänen in the Focus, fails to react promptly to the turning vehicle due to wet and slippery road conditions.
- 18:30 hours: Mr. Kivinen in the Volvo attempts to avoid a collision by braking but loses control on the slippery surface, skidding into the intersection.
- 18:30-18:31 hours: The Volvo collides with Ms. Pitkänen's Corolla and Mr. Hietala's Focus, pushing both vehicles partially across the intersection.
- 18:31 hours: Mr. Mäkelä in the Qashqai, approaching from the north, encounters the disrupted traffic flow and collides with Ms. Kivinen's Civic and Mr. Pitkänen's pickup truck, which were following closely behind each other.
- 18:32 hours: The impact causes a chain reaction, involving additional collisions as vehicles attempt to maneuver or stop.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The roads were wet and slippery due to intermittent rainfall throughout the evening, contributing significantly to the loss of vehicle control experienced by several drivers. Visibility was moderately reduced, but not severely impaired, as streetlights were operational along Kauppiaselkä and Rantapellonkatu.

**Vehicle Damage:**

1. Volvo V60 (Finland's license plate 123-AB-45): Front-end damage, airbag deployment.
2. Toyota Corolla (Finland's license plate 678-CD-90): Left side and rear-end damage, airbag deployment.
3. Ford Focus (Finland's license plate 345-EF-67): Rear-end damage, minor dent to passenger side.
4. Honda Civic (Finland's license plate 987-GH-21): Front-end damage, airbag deployment.
5. Nissan Qashqai (Finland's license plate 567-IJ-34): Right side and front-end damage, minor roof damage.
6. BMW X1 (Finland's license plate 890-KL-56): Rear-end damage, minor side scuffing.
7. Dodge Ram Pickup Truck (Finland's license plate 234-MN-78): Front-end damage, airbag deployment.

**Witness Statements:**

Several pedestrians and occupants of nearby buildings provided consistent accounts corroborating the sequence of events. Notably, Ms. Liisa Rantanen, a resident of Kauppiaselkänkatu 25, reported seeing Mr. Hietala's Focus following too closely behind Ms. Pitkänen's Corolla just before the collision.

**Conclusion:**

The multi-vehicle collision at the intersection of Kauppiaselkä and Rantapellonkatu was primarily caused by a combination of factors including inadequate reaction times due to wet road conditions, failure to maintain safe following distances, and an attempted overtaking maneuver in close proximity to an ongoing turning movement. All involved parties sustained minor to moderate injuries, with no life-threatening conditions reported.
