**Narrative:**

On the afternoon of 20th October 2023, at approximately 14:20 hrs, a three-vehicle traffic incident occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Rautatieasema in Taipalsaari, Finland. The drivers involved were identified as Mikko Aalto, a local baker residing at 34 Linnunrata, and two passengers, his wife Anna Aalto, and their son Joona, both present in the vehicle at the time. The other drivers were Sanna Kivinen, a school teacher from 12 Pohjolanpuu, and Jussi Rantala, a construction worker living at 56 Kauppiasema.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **14:18 hrs:** Mikko Aalto, driving his 2018 Volvo V60 with license plate 123-AB-45, proceeded northbound on Kauppakatu approaching the Rautatieasema intersection. Sanna Kivinen in her 2020 Toyota Corolla (license plate 678-CD-90), traveling eastbound on Rautatieasema, prepared to turn left into Kauppakatu. Jussi Rantala, operating a 2015 Ford Fiesta (license plate 345-EF-67), was heading westbound on Rautatieasema, intending to continue straight through the intersection.

- **14:19 hrs:** As Mikko Aalto's vehicle entered the intersection, Sanna Kivinen initiated her left turn without yielding to oncoming traffic, colliding with the passenger side of Aalto’s Volvo. The impact caused Aalto's car to spin, coming to a stop facing westbound on Rautatieasema.

- **14:20 hrs:** Jussi Rantala, having noticed the collision unfolding, attempted to brake but was unable to avoid colliding with the rear of Mikko Aalto's spinning Volvo. The Fiesta struck the Volvo’s driver side, pushing it further down the road.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The day was clear with temperatures around 5°C (41°F), under dry but cold conditions typical for late October in Finland. While roads were not icy or slippery, the cold weather may have contributed to reduced visibility due to condensation on windshields and a slight decrease in tire grip.

**Vehicle Damage:**

- **Volvo V60 (123-AB-45):** Significant damage to the passenger side, including a dented door, shattered window, and scrapes along the side panel. The airbags deployed during the collision.

- **Toyota Corolla (678-CD-90):** Front-end damage, with the left headlight crushed and minor scratches on the front bumper.

- **Ford Fiesta (345-EF-67):** Rear-end damage, evidenced by a crumpled boot lid and minor dents along the rear panel.

**Witness Statements:**

Several passersby, including Pekka Hietala from 21 Kauppiasema, provided consistent accounts of the events leading up to the collision. They noted that Ms. Kivinen's failure to yield clearly contributed to the chain reaction.

**Action Taken:**

All parties involved were transported to the Taipalsaari Health Center for medical evaluation, reporting no serious injuries. The vehicles were towed to a nearby garage for detailed inspection and repair. Officer Korhonen filed an official report and issued citations to Sanna Kivinen for failure to yield the right of way, in accordance with Finnish Road Traffic Act §28(1).

**Report Conclusion:**

This incident serves as a reminder of the importance of vigilance at intersections, especially during daylight hours when visibility can be affected by various factors including weather conditions. All vehicles are urged to maintain a defensive driving approach to prevent similar occurrences in the future.
