**Narrative:**

On the night of 20th January 2024, at approximately 23:15 hours, a two-vehicle collision occurred on Kauppakatu in Lestijärvi. The incident involved a white 2018 Volvo V60, registered with the license plate 123-ABC, driven by Mr. Mikko Koskinen, a 45-year-old local resident, and a silver 2020 Toyota Corolla, identified by its license plate number 456-DEF, operated by Ms. Anna Pitkänen, a 31-year-old residing in a nearby village.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **23:08 hours:** Mr. Koskinen departed from his residence at Kauppakatu 8 heading towards the town center. Ms. Pitkänen was returning home from work, traveling in the opposite direction on Kauppakatu from her place of employment near the outskirts of Lestijärvi.
- **23:12 hours:** Fog began to descend, reducing visibility significantly along Kauppakatu, a road known for its gentle curves and moderate speed limits.
- **23:14 hours:** Mr. Koskinen, while navigating the reduced visibility, failed to notice Ms. Pitkänen's vehicle approaching due to the dense fog conditions.
- **23:15 hours:** The Volvo V60 collided with the Toyota Corolla in a head-on manner approximately 50 meters from the intersection of Kauppakatu and Mestijärvenkatu.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The prevailing weather condition at the time was foggy, with visibility reduced to less than 50 meters. The road surface was damp due to intermittent light rain, compounding the hazardous conditions for drivers. There were no prior reports of road defects contributing to the incident.

**Vehicle Damage:**

The Volvo V60 sustained significant frontal damage, including a crumpled hood and a damaged headlight. The driver-side airbag deployed upon impact. The Toyota Corolla suffered extensive damage to its front end, with the bumper detached and the grille collapsed. Airbags in Ms. Pitkänen's vehicle also deployed during the collision.

**Witnesses:**

A passerby, Mr. Jari Lehtinen, who was walking his dog along Mestijärvenkatu, witnessed the incident and immediately called emergency services at 23:16 hours. He reported that both drivers appeared shaken but not visibly injured.

**Further Actions:**

Emergency medical services arrived promptly at 23:20 hours and assessed both drivers and passengers, confirming no serious injuries. The vehicles were towed away by a local recovery service by 23:45 hours for further examination and storage. Both drivers were advised to seek medical check-ups as a precaution due to the nature of airbag deployment.
