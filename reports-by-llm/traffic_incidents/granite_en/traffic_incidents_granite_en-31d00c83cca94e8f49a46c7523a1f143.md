**Narrative:**

On the morning of 24.03.2023, at approximately 08:45, a two-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ruotsalanpuro in the municipality of Soini, Finland. The vehicles involved were a silver 2019 Toyota Corolla, registered with the license plate 34-FIN-123, driven by Mr. Mikko Koskinen, 38, residing at Kauppakatu 56, Soini, and a blue 2020 Ford Focus, registered with the license plate 78-FIN-456, operated by Ms. Anna Pitk채nen, 29, from Ruotsalanpuro 12, Soini.

Witnesses at the scene, including Mr. Jussi Laine and Ms. Leena Virtanen, reported that both vehicles were traveling towards the intersection from perpendicular streets. The Toyota Corolla, driven by Koskinen, was proceeding north on Kauppakatu, while the Ford Focus, operated by Pitk채nen, was heading east on Ruotsalanpuro. As both drivers approached the intersection, icy road conditions contributed to reduced traction, impairing their ability to maintain control of their respective vehicles.

According to witness statements and preliminary evidence at the scene, Mr. Koskinen attempted to navigate the intersection, but his vehicle's front passenger side struck the driver's side of Ms. Pitk채nen's Ford Focus. The impact caused both vehicles to rotate slightly before coming to rest facing opposite directions on Kauppakatu and Ruotsalanpuro, respectively.

**Timeline of Events:**

- 08:43: Each driver approached the designated intersection from their respective streets.
- 08:44: As both vehicles neared the intersection, icy road conditions became evident, reducing tire grip on the road surface.
- 08:45: The collision occurred as described above.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The morning of the incident was characterized by sub-freezing temperatures and intermittent light snowfall, which had resulted in icy road surfaces. These conditions were confirmed by local weather reports and observations from responding officers. The icy roads significantly contributed to the drivers' loss of control during their approach to the intersection.

**Vehicle Damage:**

The Toyota Corolla sustained damage primarily to its front passenger side, including a dented door, scraped paintwork, and a damaged headlight. The Ford Focus incurred driver's side damage, with a crumpled door, scratched paint, and a broken side mirror. Both vehicles were towed from the scene for further inspection and repair.

**Conclusion:**

The collision was attributed to hazardous icy road conditions that impaired vehicle control, leading to the unfortunate accident. No serious injuries were reported among the drivers or passengers involved. Both parties cooperated with investigators, and no citations were issued at this time pending further review of dashcam footage and any available CCTV recordings from nearby establishments. The investigation remains ongoing to determine liability fully.
