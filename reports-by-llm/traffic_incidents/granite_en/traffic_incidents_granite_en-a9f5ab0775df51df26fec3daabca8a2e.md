**Narrative:**

On the afternoon of 30th June 2025, at approximately 14:15 hours, a two-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Pohjoiskarinkuunpuu in Siuntio, Finland. The incident involved a grey 2018 Volvo V60, registered with the license plate 34-VLO-FI, driven by Mr. Mikko Koskinen, a 45-year-old local resident of Kauppakatu 12, and a silver 2020 Toyota Corolla, identified by its registration number 87-TOY-FI, operated by Ms. Anna Pitkänen, a 32-year-old residing at Pohjoiskarinkuunpuu 5.

**Timeline of Events:**

1. **14:00 - 14:10 hours:** Both vehicles were traveling within the speed limits on their respective roads leading to the intersection. The weather conditions were noted as icy, with temperatures hovering just above freezing at 2°C, contributing to slippery road surfaces.

2. **14:10 - 14:15 hours:** Mr. Koskinen, approaching the intersection from the north on Kauppakatu, proceeded to turn left onto Pohjoiskarinkuunpuu intending to head south. Simultaneously, Ms. Pitkänen was traveling east on Pohjoiskarinkuunpuu and prepared to continue straight through the intersection.

3. **14:15 hours:** As Mr. Koskinen's Volvo entered the intersection, it encountered a patch of particularly slick ice, causing his vehicle to lose traction. Unable to maintain control, the Volvo slid into the path of Ms. Pitkänen’s Corolla, which was proceeding through the intersection.

4. **14:15 - 14:20 hours:** The collision occurred on the southeastern quadrant of the intersection, resulting in significant frontal damage to both vehicles. The Volvo sustained substantial damage to its passenger side and front end, while the Corolla incurred damage primarily to its driver's side.

**Witness Statements:**

Several pedestrians witnessed the incident from a nearby café on Kauppakatu. Among them was Ms. Laura Rantanen, who provided a detailed account corroborating the sequence of events. She noted that both drivers appeared shaken but uninjured immediately post-collision.

**Vehicle Damage and License Plate Details:**

- **Volvo V60 (34-VLO-FI):** Extensive frontal and side damage, including a bent passenger door and a crumpled hood. Airbag deployment was noted, indicating occupant restraint during the collision.

- **Toyota Corolla (87-TOY-FI):** Driver's side door dented, scraping along the passenger side, and front bumper detached. No airbag deployment was reported, suggesting the driver was not in immediate danger at the time of impact.

**Road Conditions:**

The icy road conditions were confirmed by responding officers and noted as a contributing factor to the loss of vehicle control. The Finnish Meteorological Institute's weather report for Siuntio on that day indicated intermittent light snowfall followed by freezing temperatures, leading to hazardous driving conditions.

**Conclusion:**

The collision was determined to be an accident resulting from adverse weather conditions and driver error. Both drivers were cited for failing to maintain control of their vehicles under icy road conditions. No serious injuries were reported, though both parties sought medical evaluation as a precaution. 

This report is submitted for further investigation and insurance claims processing. Further inquiries should be directed to Inspector Jouko Hietala at the Siuntio Police Department.
