*Date of Incident:* 05.05.2025

*Location:* Intersection of Keskusvuorinaukio and Yli-Käsäravalkea, Rovaniemi, Finland  

**Reporting Officer:** Inspector Jari Hietala

**Narrative:**

On the night of 05.05.2025, at approximately 23:45, a two-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Keskusvuorinaukio and Yli-Käsäravalkea in Rovaniemi, Finland. The incident involved a white 2019 Toyota Corolla, driven by Mr. Mikko Virtanen, 34, residing at Keskusvuorintie 12, and a silver 2020 Ford Focus, operated by Ms. Anna Pitkänen, 28, from Yli-Käsäravalkea 5.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **23:40**: Mr. Virtanen was driving westbound on Keskusvuorinaukio towards the intersection intending to turn left onto Yli-Käsäravalkea. Ms. Pitkänen was traveling eastbound on Keskusvuorinaukio, approaching the same intersection, with no immediate intent to turn.

- **23:41**: Fog began to roll in, reducing visibility significantly. The Finnish Meteorological Institute later reported fog density of 150 meters at the time of the incident.

- **23:43**: As Mr. Virtanen prepared to make his left turn, he misjudged the distance to oncoming traffic due to the reduced visibility caused by the fog. Ms. Pitkänen, unaware of Mr. Virtanen's intentions, continued eastbound towards the intersection.

- **23:44**: The vehicles collided at approximately the center of the intersection. The front driver’s side of the Corolla struck the passenger side of the Focus, resulting in substantial damage to both vehicles.

**Witness Statements:**

A passing truck driver, Mr. Jouko Rantala, traveling south on Yli-Käsäravalkea, witnessed the incident and immediately pulled over to assist. He confirmed that both drivers appeared shaken but uninjured. No passengers were reported in either vehicle.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The prevailing weather condition at the time was dense fog, which severely impaired visibility. According to local weather records, the fog had settled over Rovaniemi around 23:30, persisting until approximately 00:15 when it began to dissipate. The road surface was dry but slick from the fog, contributing to reduced traction for drivers.

**Vehicle Details:**

- **Toyota Corolla (Finnish License Plate 123-AB-45):** Sustained significant frontal damage, including a crumpled hood and damaged headlights. Airbags deployed during the collision.

- **Ford Focus (Finnish License Plate 678-CD-90):** Experienced passenger-side impact, with a dented door, shattered side window, and damage to the rear quarter panel from the Corolla's side skirt. Airbags also deployed in this vehicle.

**Damage Assessment:**

Both vehicles were towed from the scene by private recovery services. The estimated repair costs for the Toyota Corolla are approximately €8,000, while the Ford Focus is expected to require repairs costing around €7,500.

**Investigation Outcome:**

No criminal charges were warranted as the collision appeared to be a result of misjudgment in adverse weather conditions rather than negligence or recklessness. Both drivers were advised to claim insurance for the damages incurred.

This report is submitted for information and potential insurance purposes, with all parties involved notified accordingly. Further investigation into preventive measures against fog-related accidents in the Rovaniemi area is recommended.
