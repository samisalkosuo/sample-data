**Narrative:**

On the afternoon of 27th October 2024, at approximately 14:30 hours, a two-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ratinauksenkatu in Outokumpu, Finland. The incident involved a grey 2018 Volvo V60, registered with the license plate 123-ABC, driven by Mr. Mikko Kivinen, a 45-year-old local resident, and a white 2020 Toyota Corolla, identified by its license plate number 456-DEF, operated by Ms. Anna Pitkänen, a 31-year-old residing in the neighbouring municipality of Kihla.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **14:20 hours:** Ms. Pitkänen, driving her Toyota Corolla from the south on Ratinauksenkatu, approached the intersection intending to turn left onto Kauppakatu heading north. Mr. Kivinen, in his Volvo V60, was travelling north along Kauppakatu, proceeding straight through the intersection.

- **14:25 hours:** As Ms. Pitkänen entered the intersection, she encountered mixed snow and rain conditions, which reduced visibility and grip on the road surface. The precipitation had accumulated unevenly, creating patches of black ice.

- **14:28 hours:** Mr. Kivinen, maintaining a lawful speed of 50 km/h in the prevailing weather, was unable to avoid Ms. Pitkänen's vehicle due to the compromised traction caused by the mixed snow and rain. The front passenger side of his Volvo collided with the driver’s side of Ms. Pitkänen's Corolla.

- **14:29 hours:** Both vehicles came to a stop on Kauppakatu, partially blocking the northbound lane. No immediate injuries were reported by the drivers or passengers; however, both parties sought medical evaluation as a precautionary measure at the scene.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The prevailing weather conditions at the time of the incident were mixed snow and rain, leading to reduced visibility and hazardous road surfaces. The combination of wet roads and intermittent snowfall had resulted in the formation of black ice, contributing to the loss of traction experienced by both drivers.

**Vehicle Damage:**

- The Volvo V60 sustained damage primarily to its front passenger side, including a dented fender, a cracked headlight, and scratches along the side panel.

- The Toyota Corolla incurred damage on its driver’s side, with a bent door, scrapes along the rear quarter panel, and a damaged rear bumper.

**Witnesses:**

Two passersby, Mr. Jari Lehtinen and Ms. Laura Mäkelä, provided statements corroborating the sequence of events and noting the adverse weather conditions. They also confirmed that both drivers appeared to have taken reasonable actions given the circumstances.

**Conclusion:**

This report reflects a standard two-vehicle collision influenced by challenging mixed snow and rain conditions. Both drivers acted prudently under the prevailing weather, and no criminal negligence was identified. The incident serves as a reminder of the heightened risks during such adverse weather events and underscores the importance of defensive driving practices.
