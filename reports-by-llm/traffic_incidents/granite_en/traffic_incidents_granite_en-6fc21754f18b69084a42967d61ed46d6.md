On the afternoon of 16 April 2023, at approximately 14:15 hours, a multi-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ruotsalanpuro in Pöytyä, Finland. The incident involved nine vehicles, resulting in various degrees of damage and minor injuries to the drivers and passengers.

The primary vehicles involved were:

1. A red 2018 Volvo V60, registered KY-12345, driven by Mr. Mikko Koskinen, 34, of Ruotsala, proceeding northbound on Kauppakatu.

3. Additional vehicles included a white Ford Focus, a silver Honda Civic, a black Audi A4, a grey Nissan Qashqai, a dark blue BMW 3 Series, an orange Mini Cooper, and a green Suzuki Jimny.

Witnesses on-scene reported that Ms. Pitkänen proceeded through the intersection on a green light when Mr. Koskinen, allegedly distracted by his mobile device, entered the intersection against a red light. The impact initiated a chain reaction involving the other vehicles waiting at the traffic signal or navigating the intersection.

**Timeline of Events:**

- 14:15 - Collision occurs as described above, involving multiple vehicles in a complex intersection crash.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The clear and sunny weather contributed to optimal visibility during the incident. However, the glare from the bright sunlight may have momentarily impaired Mr. Koskinen's ability to perceive the traffic signal, contributing to the cause of the collision.
