**Narrative:**

On the afternoon of 30th January 2025, at approximately 13:15, a two-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Onerva Street and Kalevantori Avenue in Kangasniemi. The drivers involved were identified as Mikko Kivinen, a local resident aged 42, driving a blue 2018 Volvo V60 with Finnish license plate 123-ABC, and Anna Pitkänen, a 35-year-old teacher, operating a grey 2020 Toyota Corolla bearing the license plate number 456-DEF.

Witnesses at the scene, notably a passerby named Jari Mäkelä, reported that both vehicles were traveling in a northerly direction on Onerva Street towards Kalevantori Avenue. As they approached the intersection, Mr. Kivinen proceeded to turn left onto Kalevantori Avenue. Ms. Pitkänen, following closely behind in her Corolla, attempted to overtake another vehicle stopped at a red light on Onerva Street, intending to continue straight ahead.

The maneuver by Ms. Pitkänen to change lanes was unsuccessful due to the presence of the halted car, causing her vehicle to collide with the passenger side of Mr. Kivinen's Volvo as it turned left. The impact resulted in moderate damage to both vehicles: the Volvo sustained scratches along its passenger door and a dented front fender, while the Corolla received scrapes on its driver’s side and a damaged headlight.

Fortunately, neither driver nor any passengers reported injuries. Both parties remained at the scene to exchange information and awaited the arrival of law enforcement.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The prevailing weather condition at the time of the incident was light rain, which contributed to reduced visibility and slightly slippery road surfaces. While not severe enough to be classified as hazardous, these conditions likely played a role in the driver's decision-making process leading up to the collision.

**Vehicle Details:**

1. **Volvo V60**  
   - License Plate: 123-ABC  
   - Color: Blue  
   - Damage: Passenger side scratches and dent, front fender damage.

2. **Toyota Corolla**  
   - License Plate: 456-DEF  
   - Color: Grey  
   - Damage: Driver's side scrapes, damaged headlight.

**Conclusion:**

The investigation concluded that the primary cause of the collision was Ms. Pitkänen's attempt to overtake another vehicle while approaching a red light, misjudging the distance and speed of oncoming traffic. Mr. Kivinen was found to be proceeding with a green left-turn signal within the confines of the law, although he might have proceeded cautiously given the weather conditions. No citations were issued at this time, but both drivers were advised to review their driving practices in similar scenarios, particularly under light rain.

This report is submitted for further review and action as deemed necessary by the Kangasniemi Police Department.
