**Narrative:**

On the evening of 06.05.2024, at approximately 21:30 hours, a three-vehicle traffic incident occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ruotsalanpuro in Karkkila, Finland. The primary contributing factors were heavy rainfall and potential driver error.

The vehicles involved were a silver 2019 Toyota Corolla, registered as FIN-123XY, driven by Mr. Mikko Koskinen, 34, of Ruotsalanpuro 12; a blue 2020 Ford Focus, identified with registration FIN-456AB, operated by Ms. Sanna Pietilä, 28, from Kauppakatu 45; and a grey 2017 Volkswagen Golf, marked with FIN-789CD, driven by Mr. Jussi Rantala, 42, residing at Kauppakatu 99.

According to witness statements and CCTV footage from a nearby business, Ms. Pietilä was proceeding southbound on Kauppakatu towards Ruotsalanpuro. Mr. Koskinen, traveling northbound in the same street, attempted to turn left onto Ruotsalanpuro. Simultaneously, Mr. Rantala approached from Ruotsalanpuro heading west, intending to turn right onto Kauppakatu.

The heavy rain reduced visibility, and it appears that Mr. Koskinen misjudged the distance and speed of oncoming traffic, colliding with Ms. Pietilä's Ford Focus as she navigated the intersection. The impact caused Ms. Pietilä’s vehicle to spin, striking Mr. Rantala’s Volkswagen Golf as it proceeded through the intersection.
