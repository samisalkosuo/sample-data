**Incident Narrative:**

On the morning of 29th June 2024, at approximately 08:30 hours, a two-vehicle collision occurred on Kauppakatu, a primary road in Loviisa. The drivers involved were Mr. Jari Pitkäranta, a local resident aged 45, driving a silver 2019 Toyota Corolla with license plate 123-ABC, and Ms. Kaisa Hietala, a 32-year-old resident of Loviisa, operating a blue 2020 Ford Focus bearing the license plate 456-DEF.

According to witness statements from passersby, Mr. Pitkäranta was proceeding eastbound on Kauppakatu towards the town center. Ms. Hietala was traveling in the opposite direction, westbound, also heading towards the town center. The road surface was wet due to ongoing heavy rainfall, which significantly reduced visibility and grip.

As Mr. Pitkäranta approached the intersection with Kauppakeskus (the central shopping area), he reportedly attempted to make a left turn into the parking lot of the local supermarket, Lidl Loviisa, without fully clearing oncoming traffic. Ms. Hietala, maintaining her lane and adhering to the speed limit despite the challenging weather conditions, collided with Mr. Pitkäranta's vehicle on its passenger side.

**Timeline of Events:**

- 08:25 hours: Heavy rain commences in Loviisa, affecting road visibility and grip.
- 08:28 hours: Both vehicles enter Kauppakatu from adjacent streets, heading towards each other.
- 08:29 hours: Mr. Pitkäranta signals his intention to turn left into Lidl's parking lot.
- 08:30 hours: Collision occurs as Ms. Hietala’s vehicle strikes the passenger side of Mr. Pitkäranta's Toyota Corolla.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The heavy rainfall significantly impaired visibility, contributing to reduced reaction times for both drivers. The wet road surface also decreased tire grip, exacerbating the severity of the collision. Emergency services reported that water accumulation on Kauppakatu further complicated recovery efforts post-incident.

**Vehicle Damage:**

Mr. Pitkäranta's Toyota Corolla sustained damage primarily to its passenger side, including a dented door, a broken side mirror, and scratches along the vehicle’s length. Ms. Hietala's Ford Focus suffered front-end damage, with a crumpled hood and minor scuffing on the driver's side.

**Witnesses:**

Two pedestrians, Mr. Mikko Kivinen and Ms. Anna Lehtinen, witnessed the incident from a nearby bus stop. They provided consistent accounts of the events leading up to the collision and corroborated the drivers' statements regarding weather conditions.

**Investigation Outcome:**

Preliminary findings suggest that while Mr. Pitkäranta failed to fully clear oncoming traffic before initiating his turn, Ms. Hietala was driving within the speed limit under challenging weather conditions. No evidence of reckless driving or intoxication was found for either party. Both drivers were issued warnings for careless driving due to the adverse weather conditions.
