**Narrative:**

On the morning of 08.05.2023, at approximately 08:45, a two-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ratinauksenranta in the municipality of Marttila, Finland. The drivers involved were Mr. Mikko Pietilä, 34, a local baker residing at 22 Asemakatu, and Ms. Leena Virtanen, 29, a teacher living at 15 Kauppakatu.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **08:40**: Mr. Pietilä, driving his 2018 Volvol XC60 with license plate 34-VXL-12, proceeded northbound on Kauppakatu towards the intersection intending to turn left onto Ratinauksenranta. Ms. Virtanen, operating her 2020 Toyota Corolla, bearing license plate number 56-TYC-98, was traveling southbound on Kauppakatu.

- **08:43**: As Mr. Pietilä approached the intersection, he initiated his left turn signal. Ms. Virtanen, maintaining a steady speed of approximately 45 km/h in compliance with the posted limit, continued southward.

- **08:44**: A witness, Ms. Sari Koskinen from nearby address 32 Kauppakatu, reported observing Mr. Pietilä's vehicle partially enter the intersection when it was struck on its passenger side by Ms. Virtanen’s Corolla. The impact caused both vehicles to come to a stop, with the baker's vehicle sustaining significant damage to the passenger door and fender, while the teacher's car received damage to its front driver-side quarter panel.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The morning was clear and dry, with temperatures around 5°C. Although there were no adverse weather conditions, the roads had not yet warmed sufficiently from the overnight frost, contributing to slightly reduced traction. There were no roadworks or obstructions reported in the vicinity of the intersection.

**Damage Description:**

Mr. Pietilä's Volvo XC60 exhibited substantial damage to its passenger-side door, requiring it to be towed from the scene. The vehicle also had a bent fender and scrapes along its rear quarter panel. Ms. Virtanen’s Toyota Corolla sustained damage to its front driver's side, including a dented bumper and scratches along the passenger door, rendering it driveable but with cosmetic impairments.

**Witnesses:**

In addition to Ms. Koskinen, another witness, Mr. Jari Lehtinen from 45 Ratinauksenranta, provided a consistent account of the events leading up to the collision. He stated that both drivers appeared shaken but uninjured immediately post-incident.

**Further Actions:**

Both drivers were transported to Marttila Central Hospital for precautionary checks and released with no reported injuries. The vehicles have been secured at a nearby garage pending insurance assessments and police investigation. No citations have been issued at this time, but the case remains open for further inquiries regarding potential contributing factors such as driver distraction or fatigue.
