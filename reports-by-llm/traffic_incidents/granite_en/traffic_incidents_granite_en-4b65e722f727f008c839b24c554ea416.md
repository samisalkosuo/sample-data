**Narrative:**

On the afternoon of 14 August 2023, at approximately 14:30, a multi-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ruotsalanpuro in the municipality of Keitele, Finland. The incident involved six vehicles, resulting in various degrees of damage and minor injuries to the occupants.

The primary vehicles involved were:

1. A white 2019 Toyota Corolla, registered KY-1234, driven by Ms. Anna Pitkäranta, 35, residing at Kauppakatu 123, Keitele. Ms. Pitkäranta was traveling southbound on Kauppakatu approaching the intersection.

3. A blue 2018 Volkswagen Golf, registered VK-9101, driven by Ms. Laura Kaski, 27, living at Kauppakatu 456, Keitele. Ms. Kaski was following the Toyota Corolla southbound on Kauppakatu.

4. A red 2021 Honda Civic, registered HC-2345, driven by Mr. Olli Mäkelä, 31, from Ruotsalanpuro 789, Keitele. Mr. Mäkelä was driving westbound on Kauppakatu and approaching the intersection.

5. A black 2017 Nissan Sentra, registered NS-6789, driven by Ms. Sanna Lehtinen, 29, residing at Kauppakatu 321, Keitele. Ms. Lehtinen was traveling eastbound on Ruotsalanpuro, approaching the intersection from Mr. Räty's direction.

6. A silver 2016 BMW X1, registered BM-0123, driven by Mr. Jussi Kivinen, 50, from a neighboring town, was following Ms. Lehtinen on Ruotsalanpuro.

**Timeline of Events:**

- At approximately 14:28, all vehicles were in their respective lanes, approaching the intersection under snowy conditions. Visibility was reduced due to freshly fallen snow covering the roads.

- At 14:29, Mr. Räty in the Ford Focus proceeded through a green light on Ruotsalanpuro intending to turn left onto Kauppakatu.

- Simultaneously, at 14:29, Ms. Pitkäranten in the Toyota Corolla continued straight ahead southbound on Kauppakatu, unaware of Mr. Räty's intent to turn.

- Ms. Kaski in the Volkswagen Golf, following closely behind Ms. Pitkäranten, was unable to react in time and collided with the Toyota Corolla.

- Meanwhile, Mr. Mäkelä in the Honda Civic, traveling westbound on Kauppakatu, encountered a red light at the intersection but was unable to stop due to the slippery road conditions caused by the snow. He collided with Ms. Lehtinen's Nissan Sentra, which was making a right turn onto Kauppakatu from Ruotsalanpuro.

- The impact of these initial collisions caused a chain reaction. Mr. Kivinen in the BMW X1, following Ms. Lehtinen closely, was unable to avoid colliding with the Nissan Sentra as well.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The roads were covered with approximately 2 cm of fresh snow, significantly reducing visibility and traction for all drivers. The snowfall had begun around 14:00 that day, and conditions worsened just prior to the incident. There were no prior reports of hazardous road conditions, but the sudden weather change contributed to the severity of this multi-vehicle collision.

**Vehicle Damage:**

1. Toyota Corolla (KY-1234): Heavy frontal damage, airbags deployed. Driver (Anna Pitkäranten) sustained minor injuries.

2. Ford Focus (KE-5678): Moderate side damage, airbags deployed. Driver (Mikko Räty) sustained minor injuries.

3. Volkswagen Golf (VK-9101): Heavy rear-end damage. Passenger (uninjured).

4. Honda Civic (HC-2345): Moderate frontal damage, airbags deployed. Driver (Olli Mäkelä) sustained minor injuries.

5. Nissan Sentra (NS-6789): Heavy side damage, airbags deployed. Passenger (Sanna Lehtinen) sustained minor injuries.

6. BMW X1 (BM-0123): Moderate rear-end damage. Driver (Jussi Kivinen) uninjured.

**Witnesses:**

Several pedestrians and occupants of nearby buildings witnessed the incident. Notable among them were Ms. Eeva Sipilä, a local shopkeeper from 'Sipilän Kauppa' on Kauppakatu, and Mr. Jouko Hiltunen, a resident at Ruotsalanpuro 56. Both provided statements corroborating the sequence of events described above.

**Conclusion:**

The collision was primarily caused by the adverse weather conditions—fresh snow reducing visibility and traction, leading to misjudgments in speed and stopping distances. All drivers involved were cited for failing to adapt their driving to the road conditions. Medical assistance was promptly dispatched, and all injured parties were transported to Pirkanmaa Hospital District facilities for treatment of minor injuries.
