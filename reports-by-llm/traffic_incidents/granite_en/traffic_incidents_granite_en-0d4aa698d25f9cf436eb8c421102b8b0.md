- **08:28:** Both drivers reportedly reduced speed as per the traffic signals, which indicated a cautious approach due to wet and slippery road conditions resulting from overnight rainfall.
- **08:29:** As Ms. Pitkänen entered the intersection, she lost traction on the slick pavement, causing her vehicle to slide into Koskinen's path.
