**Narrative:**

On the evening of 01 August 2024, at approximately 18:30 hours, a three-vehicle traffic incident occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ratinauksenranta in the municipality of Sund, Finland. The weather conditions were foggy, with reduced visibility affecting driver perception.

The vehicles involved were a silver 2019 Toyota Corolla, registered as FIN-123XY, driven by Mr. Mikko Kivinen, 34, of Kauppakatu 56, Sund. He was traveling westbound on Kauppakatu approaching the intersection. A grey 2020 Volvo XC60, registered as FIN-456AB, driven by Ms. Anna Pitkänen, 29, of Ratinauksenranta 12, Sund, was proceeding northbound along Ratinauksenranta. Lastly, a blue 2018 Ford Focus, registered as FIN-789CD, driven by Mr. Jussi Lindstrom, 45, of Kauppakatu 32, Sund, was traveling eastbound on Kauppakatu.

As Ms. Pitkänen approached the intersection, she reportedly failed to notice the stop sign due to the foggy conditions. She entered the intersection in front of Mr. Kivinen's Corolla, resulting in a collision. The impact caused both vehicles to come to a halt facing each other across the intersection. Meanwhile, Mr. Lindstrom, driving the Ford Focus, was unable to stop in time and collided with the rear of Ms. Pitkänen’s Volvo.

**Witnesses:**

A passerby, Ms. Eeva Mäkelä, 67, of Kauppakatu 45, provided a statement confirming she saw Ms. Pitkänen proceed through the stop sign without slowing down. Another witness, Mr. Jari Rantanen, 32, who was driving south on a side street, reported seeing the Volvo enter the intersection unexpectedly.
