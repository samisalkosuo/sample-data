**Traffic Incident Report**

*Incident Number:* 230313-JOM-001  
*Date of Incident:* 13th March 2023  
*Location:* Intersection of Kauppakatu and Ruotsalanpuro, Jomala, Finland  
*Reporting Officer:* Inspector Marko Hietala  
*Municipality:* Jomala  

**Narrative:**

On the afternoon of 13th March 2023, at approximately 14:30 hours, a two-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ruotsalanpuro in the municipality of Jomala, Finland. The incident involved a grey 2018 Toyota Corolla, registered with the license plate 345-JOM-12, driven by Mr. Jari Koskinen, a 36-year-old local resident, and a silver 2020 Ford Focus, identified by its license plate 789-JOM-34, operated by Ms. Anna Pitkänen, a 29-year-old residing in nearby Saarikuuri.

**Timeline of Events:**

1. **14:25 hours:** Mr. Koskinen was driving eastbound on Kauppakatu towards the intersection with Ruotsalanpuro, proceeding at a moderate speed under prevailing heavy rain conditions. Ms. Pitkänen was traveling southbound on Ruotsalanpuro, approaching the same intersection.

2. **14:28 hours:** As Mr. Koskinen neared the stop line at the intersection, he observed a pedestrian crossing within the designated crosswalk. To avoid any potential collision, he reduced his speed and prepared to halt. Ms. Pitkänen, meanwhile, was maintaining her speed but reducing it slightly due to the slippery road conditions caused by the heavy rainfall.

3. **14:29 hours:** Upon realizing that Mr. Koskinen was slowing down to allow a pedestrian to cross, Ms. Pitkänen applied her brakes heavily but encountered wet asphalt, resulting in a skid. Her vehicle slid into the intersection, colliding with the passenger side of Mr. Koskinen's Toyota Corolla, which had come to a near-stop.

4. **14:30 hours:** The impact caused moderate damage to both vehicles. The Corolla sustained significant damage to its passenger side door and rear quarter panel, while the Focus incurred front-end damage, including a bent hood and damaged headlights. Fortunately, neither driver nor any pedestrians sustained serious injuries, though both were shaken by the incident.

**Weather Conditions:**

Heavy rain was reported throughout the municipality of Jomala during the time of the incident. The precipitation reduced visibility and created slippery road conditions, contributing factors in the skid experienced by Ms. Pitkänen's vehicle.

**Witness Statements:**

Several passersby witnessed the incident and provided statements to the responding officers. One such witness, Ms. Liisa Rantala, described seeing Mr. Koskinen slow down for a pedestrian and Ms. Pitkänen's vehicle skidding uncontrollably into the intersection.

**Conclusion:**

The collision was primarily caused by the adverse weather conditions—heavy rain leading to reduced visibility and slippery roads, which impaired both drivers' ability to maintain control of their vehicles. Mr. Koskinen acted prudently by reducing speed for a pedestrian, but this also contributed to Ms. Pitkänen's misjudgment of the approaching vehicle's reduced speed. No citations were issued at the scene; however, both drivers were advised to review their driving practices under challenging weather conditions.
