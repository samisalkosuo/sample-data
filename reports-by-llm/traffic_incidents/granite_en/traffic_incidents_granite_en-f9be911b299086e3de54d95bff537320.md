**Narrative:**

On the afternoon of 10th December 2022, at approximately 14:30 hours, a multi-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ratinkatu in Somero, Finland. The incident involved eight vehicles, resulting in various degrees of damage and minor injuries to the occupants.

The primary vehicles involved were:

3. A red 2017 Ford Focus, registered as FIN-789BA, driven by Mr. Mikko Hietala, 45, of Kauppakatu 321, Somero. He was following closely behind Mr. Koskinen's Corolla.

4. A white 2016 Honda Civic, registered as FIN-234CD, driven by Ms. Laura Mäkelä, 22, of Ratinkatu 654, Somero. She was approaching the intersection from the opposite direction on Ratinkatu.

5. A grey 2015 BMW 3 Series, registered as FIN-567DE, driven by Mr. Olli Kivinen, 58, of Kauppakatu 987, Somero. He was proceeding west on Kauppakatu and attempted to turn left onto Ratinkatu.

6. A black 2019 Dacia Sandero, registered as FIN-890FH, driven by Ms. Eeva Lehtinen, 31, of Ratinkatu 345, Somero. She was behind the Civic on Ratinkatu.

7. A green 2020 Nissan Qashqai, registered as FIN-910GJ, driven by Mr. Samuli Virtanen, 60, of Kauppakatu 234, Somero. He was following the BMW on Kauppakatu.

8. A yellow 2018 Ford Fiesta, registered as FIN-345HK, driven by Ms. Kaisa Rantala, 29, of Ratinkatu 789, Somero. She was approaching the intersection from a side street on Ratinkatu.

**Timeline of Events:**

- At approximately 14:28 hours, a thunderstorm with heavy rain and strong winds began affecting the area, significantly reducing visibility and making road conditions hazardous.

- At 14:30 hours, Mr. Koskinen's Corolla entered the intersection first, intending to turn right onto Ratinkatu. Ms. Pitkänen’s Volvo, traveling east on Ratinkatu, collided with the passenger side of the Corolla due to reduced visibility.

- The impact caused Mr. Koskinen's vehicle to spin, colliding with Mr. Hietala's Focus, which was following closely behind. This secondary collision propelled the Corolla into a chain reaction, striking several other vehicles already in motion or preparing to navigate the intersection.

- Ms. Mäkelä’s Civic, approaching from the opposite direction, collided with Mr. Kivinen's BMW as it attempted to turn left onto Ratinkatu. The force of this collision pushed the BMW into Ms. Lehtinen's Sandero and Mr. Virtanen's Qashqai, which were behind it on Kauppakatu.

- Ms. Rantala’s Fiesta, entering from a side street, was unable to stop in time and collided with the rear of Ms. Lehtinen's Sandero, exacerbating the impact.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The thunderstorm with heavy rainfall and strong winds significantly impaired visibility, contributing to the severity of the collision. The wet road surface compounded the risk of loss of vehicle control, especially for those vehicles attempting turns or navigating intersections during the storm's peak intensity.

**Vehicle Damage:**

1. Toyota Corolla (FIN-123XY): Passenger side heavily damaged; airbags deployed.
2. Volvo XC60 (FIN-456ZY): Front end crumpled; driver reported minor whiplash.
3. Ford Focus (FIN-789BA): Rear end smashed; passengers reported minor injuries.
4. Honda Civic (FIN-234CD): Driver's side door severely dented; driver sustained cuts from broken glass.
5. BMW 3 Series (FIN-567DE): Left front quarter panel crumpled; passenger reported mild concussion.
6. Dacia Sandero (FIN-890FH): Rear end significantly damaged; no injuries reported.
7. Nissan Qashqai (FIN-910GJ): Front bumper collapsed; driver reported shock.
8. Ford Fiesta (FIN-345HK): Rear end crushed; passenger suffered bruising from seatbelt impact.

**Witness Statements:**

Several pedestrian witnesses provided statements corroborating the described sequence of events, noting the adverse weather conditions and the difficulty in discerning vehicles' movements due to heavy rain and lightning flashes.

**Investigation Findings:**

Preliminary investigation suggests that while all drivers followed traffic signals, the severe weather conditions played a critical role in reducing visibility and contributing to the chain-reaction collisions. No evidence of reckless driving or violation of traffic laws was identified. All involved parties were cooperative during the investigation.

**Action Taken:**

Emergency medical services responded promptly, treating minor injuries on-site and transporting two individuals to Somero Central Hospital for further evaluation. The Finnish Traffic Management Centre was notified to assist with traffic diversions and clearance of the scene.

This report is preliminary and subject to further investigation as necessary. Further details may emerge regarding liability and insurance claims.
