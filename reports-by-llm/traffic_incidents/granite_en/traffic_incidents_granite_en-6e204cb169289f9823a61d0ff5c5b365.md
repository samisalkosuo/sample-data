**Narrative:**

On the evening of 26 February 2024, at approximately 18:30 hours, a two-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ruotsalanpuro in the municipality of Soini, Finland. The incident involved a grey 2019 Toyota Corolla, registered with the license plate 34-SOI-12, driven by Mr. Mikko Kivinen, a 38-year-old local resident, and a silver 2020 Ford Focus, identified by its license plate 78-SOI-91, operated by Ms. Anna Pitkänen, a 25-year-old residing in nearby Saariku.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **18:25 hours:** Mr. Kivinen, driving his Toyota Corolla southbound on Kauppakatu, approached the intersection intending to turn left onto Ruotsalanpuro. Ms. Pitkänen, in her Ford Focus, was travelling northbound on Kauppakatu, heading towards the same intersection.
- **18:28 hours:** As Mr. Kivinen prepared to make his left turn, Ms. Pitkänen continued at a moderate speed, unaware of the impending collision due to mixed snow and rain reducing visibility.
- **18:30 hours:** The vehicles collided in the intersection. The front passenger side of the Corolla struck the driver's side of the Focus, causing significant damage to both vehicles.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The prevailing weather conditions at the time were mixed snow and rain, which contributed to reduced visibility and slippery road surfaces. The Finnish Meteorological Institute reported light snowfall interspersed with periods of heavy rain, complicating driving conditions.

**Vehicle Damage Description:**

- **Toyota Corolla (34-SOI-12):** Sustained damage to the front passenger side, including a crumpled fender and a dented door. The airbag deployed during the collision.
- **Ford Focus (78-SOI-91):** Experienced damage to the driver's side, with a bent hood and scrapes along the passenger side. The front bumper was dislodged from its original position.

**Witness Statements:**

A passerby, Ms. Laura Mäkelä, provided a statement confirming that both vehicles were in motion at the time of impact and described the weather as particularly challenging for driving. She also noted that neither driver appeared to apply brakes before the collision, suggesting possible misjudgment of distance or speed due to adverse conditions.

**Conclusion:**

The collision appears to have resulted from a combination of factors including reduced visibility due to mixed snow and rain, potential misjudgment of speed or distance by both drivers, and possibly distraction. Both drivers were transported to the Soini Central Hospital for assessment and treatment of minor injuries. No further individuals were involved, and no additional vehicles were reported at the scene.

This report is submitted for further investigation and potential insurance claims processing. Further inquiries should be directed to Inspector Jouko Hietala at the Soini Police Department.
