6. **Eeva Kaski**, a 23-year-old student from the University of Helsinki, riding as a passenger in Ms. Lehtinen's Civic. Ms. Kaski sustained minor injuries during the collision.

**Witnesses:**
Several pedestrians and occupants of nearby vehicles provided statements. Notable witness accounts include:
- **Marko Pietilä**, a 40-year-old local resident who was waiting at a nearby bus stop, reported seeing Ms. Kivinen proceed through the intersection with a green light, followed closely by Mr. Hietala.
- **Anna-Liisa Rautiainen**, a 58-year-old shopkeeper from a nearby store on Kauppakatu, confirmed that Mr. Pitkäranta's vehicle was traveling at an apparent normal speed but appeared to have difficulty braking due to the windy conditions.

**Timeline of Events:**
1. **17:28 hours**: Ms. Kivinen and Mr. Hietala approach the intersection from perpendicular directions on Rannikko and Kauppakatu, respectively. Traffic lights indicate a green for both drivers.
2. **17:29 hours**: Ms. Lehtinen enters the intersection from Kauppakatu heading east, colliding with Mr. Pitkäranta's Volvo at approximately 17:30 hours as he attempts to navigate the intersection amidst wind gusts affecting vehicle control.
3. **17:30-17:31 hours**: The initial impact causes a chain reaction, with Mr. Rantala's Audi striking Ms. Lehtinen’s Civic from behind. Ms. Kaski sustains minor injuries in this secondary collision.

A grey 2017 BMW X1, driven by **Teppo Koskinen**, a 38-year-old from nearby Kerava, was following Ms. Virtanen and collided with her vehicle due to reduced visibility caused by wind-blown debris.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**
The prevailing weather conditions at the time of the incident were windy with gusts, significantly impacting road safety. The strong winds affected vehicle control, particularly for those entering the intersection from perpendicular directions. Visibility was moderately reduced due to blowing dust and debris, complicating driver assessments and reactions.

**Vehicle Damage:**
- **Volvo V60 (123-ABC)**: Significant frontal damage, airbags deployed.
- **Toyota Corolla (456-DEF)**: Minor rear-end damage.
- **Honda Civic (JKL-MNO)**: Heavy frontal and side damage, airbags deployed. Passenger Eeva Kaski sustained minor injuries.

**Conclusion:**
The multi-vehicle collision at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Rannikko in Espoo on 04.08.2024 was primarily caused by challenging weather conditions, specifically strong winds affecting vehicle control and visibility. All drivers involved were cooperative during the investigation, and no criminal negligence was identified. Recommendations include enhanced road signage and potential installation of windbreaks or improved landscaping to mitigate future incidents under similar meteorological conditions.
