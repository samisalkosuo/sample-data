**Narrative:**

On the evening of 14 November 2022, at approximately 18:30, a two-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Rannikontie in Lumijoki, Finland. The incident involved a grey 2018 Volvo V60, registered with the license plate 123-ABC, driven by Mr. Mikko Aalto, a 45-year-old local resident of Kauppakatu 23, and a silver 2020 Toyota Corolla, identified by its license plate 456-DEF, operated by Ms. Anna Pitkänen, a 32-year-old residing on Rannikontie 19.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **18:20**: Ms. Pitkänen, driving her Toyota Corolla from the south on Rannikontie, approached the intersection intending to turn left onto Kauppakatu. Mr. Aalto, in his Volvo V60, was travelling north along Kauppakatu towards the same intersection.
- **18:25**: As Ms. Pitkänen prepared to make her turn, she checked her rearview mirror and left-side mirror but failed to notice Mr. Aalto's vehicle due to overcast weather conditions reducing visibility.
- **18:28**: Ms. Pitkänen initiated her left turn without yielding to oncoming traffic, entering the path of Mr. Aalto’s Volvo V60.
- **18:30**: The front passenger side of Mr. Aalto's vehicle collided with the driver's side of Ms. Pitkänen's car. Both vehicles came to a stop on the northeast quadrant of the intersection, sustaining moderate damage.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The prevailing weather at the time was overcast, with reduced visibility due to low-lying cloud cover. Although no precipitation was reported, the diffuse lighting conditions contributed to decreased driver perception, particularly for Ms. Pitkänen as she prepared to make her turn. The road surface was damp but not icy, which may have affected tire grip and braking distances.

**Damage Description:**

- Mr. Aalto's Volvo V60 sustained damage to the front passenger side, including a dented fender and scratches along the door. The airbag deployed during the collision.
- Ms. Pitkänen's Toyota Corolla incurred damage to its driver’s side, with a crumpled front panel and minor paint transfer from the Volvo. The airbag in her vehicle also deployed.

**Witnesses:**

Two passersby, Mr. Jussi Koskinen and Ms. Laura Mäkelä, witnessed the incident and provided statements corroborating the sequence of events. They noted that both drivers appeared shaken but uninjured. Emergency services were promptly alerted, and both individuals were transported to Lumijoki Central Hospital for precautionary checks, with negative results.

**Additional Notes:**

Both vehicles were towed from the scene by a local recovery service, and the intersection was temporarily closed for investigation and cleanup. No citations were issued at the scene pending the completion of this report. Further analysis will determine if additional measures, such as improved signage or traffic calming, are warranted at this intersection given the weather conditions present during the incident.
