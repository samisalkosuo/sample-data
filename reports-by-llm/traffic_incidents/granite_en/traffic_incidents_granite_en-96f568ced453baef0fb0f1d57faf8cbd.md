**Traffic Incident Report**

*Incident Number:* 230301-R001  
*Date of Incident:* 01.03.2023  
*Location:* Ranua, Finland  
*Reporting Officer:* Inspector Jari Hämäläinen  

**Incident Description:**

On the afternoon of 01.03.2023, at approximately 14:30 hours, a two-vehicle collision occurred on Kauppakatu, a primary thoroughfare in Ranua, Finland. The incident involved a grey 2018 Volvo XC60, registered with the license plate 123-ABC, driven by Mr. Mikko Kivinen, a 45-year-old local resident, and a white 2020 Ford Focus, registered with the license plate 456-DEF, operated by Ms. Anna Pitkänen, a 31-year-old teacher from nearby Sodankylä.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **14:28 hours:** Mr. Kivinen was driving westbound on Kauppakatu towards the town center, maintaining a speed consistent with the posted limit of 50 km/h, given the overcast weather conditions that reduced visibility slightly. Ms. Pitkänen was traveling eastbound in the opposite direction at a similar speed.

- **14:29 hours:** As Mr. Kivinen approached the intersection with Hietasaarenkatu, a side street, he reportedly glanced down to adjust his music player, momentarily diverting his attention from the road ahead.

- **14:30 hours:** Upon realizing the impending collision, Ms. Pitkänen applied her brakes firmly but skidded on the damp road surface due to the overcast conditions, unable to avoid a direct impact with Mr. Kivinen's vehicle. The front passenger side of the Volvo collided with the driver’s side front of the Ford Focus.

- **14:31 hours:** Both vehicles came to a stop on the westbound lane of Kauppakatu, approximately 50 meters from the intersection with Hietasaarenkatu.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The prevailing weather at the time was overcast, with intermittent light rain. While not severe, these conditions contributed to reduced visibility and slightly damp road surfaces, which likely affected vehicle braking performance and contributed to the skidding observed during Ms. Pitkänen's evasive maneuver.

**Vehicle Damage:**

The Volvo XC60 sustained damage primarily to its front passenger side, including a crumpled fender and minor denting of the door. The Ford Focus incurred damage to its driver’s side front, with a bent hood latch and scrapes along the bumper area.

**Witnesses and Further Information:**

A passerby, Ms. Liisa Rantala, who was walking her dog on Kauppakatu, provided a statement confirming she saw both vehicles moments before the collision and heard the screeching of tires. She noted that neither driver appeared to be under the influence of alcohol or substances and that both seemed shaken but uninjured.

**Action Taken:**

Both drivers were transported to Ranua Central Hospital for precautionary checks, where they were found to have no serious injuries. The vehicles were towed away by a local recovery service, and the scene was cleared by 15:00 hours. An official investigation is underway to determine if any further actions, such as potential traffic violations, are warranted.
