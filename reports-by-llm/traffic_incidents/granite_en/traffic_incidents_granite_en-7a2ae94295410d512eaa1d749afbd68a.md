**Narrative:**

On the night of 03.01.2023, at approximately 23:45 hours, a multi-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Oulundi and Kaukola Streets in Kajaani, Finland. The incident involved ten vehicles, resulting in various degrees of damage and minor injuries to the drivers and passengers.

The primary cause of the accident appears to be a combination of factors including adverse weather conditions—a thunderstorm with heavy rainfall and reduced visibility—and potential driver error. 

**Timeline of Events:**

- **23:40 hours:** A thunderstorm commences in Kajaani, leading to heavy rain and poor visibility on the roads.
- **23:42 hours:** Driver A, Jari Koskinen (license plate 123-ABC), operating a 2018 Volvo V60, proceeds through a green light on Oulundi Street heading north towards Kaukola Street intersection.
- **23:43 hours:** Driver B, Anna Pitkänen (license plate 456-DEF), driving a 2020 Toyota Corolla, turns left from Kaukola Street onto Oulundi Street, failing to fully clear the intersection due to reduced visibility.
- **23:44 hours:** Koskinen's Volvo collides with Pitkänen's Corolla at the intersection, causing a chain reaction as subsequent vehicles—including a 2015 Ford Focus driven by Lauri Mäkelä (plate GHI-789), a 2017 Honda Civic operated by Sanna Rautio (plate JKL-012), and others—are unable to stop in time.
- **23:45 hours:** The collision escalates involving six additional vehicles, including a 2019 Nissan Qashqai driven by Olli Virtanen (plate MNO-345) and a 2021 Hyundai i30 operated by Kaisa Lehtinen (plate PQR-678).

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The thunderstorm, with heavy rainfall and strong winds, significantly impaired visibility. The wet road surface contributed to reduced traction, exacerbating the difficulty for drivers to maintain control of their vehicles.

2. **Toyota Corolla (Anna Pitkänen):** Rear-end collision, airbag deployment, driver side injury (minor).

7. The remaining four vehicles sustained minor collisions, primarily involving scrapes and dents without significant structural damage or injuries.

**Witnesses:**

Two pedestrians, witnesses Mikko Niemi and Eeva Kivinen, provided statements confirming the sequence of events and describing the weather conditions at the time of the incident.

**Conclusion:**

The collision was a result of a complex interplay between adverse weather conditions and driver behavior. All parties involved were advised to file insurance claims, and further investigation into potential charges for reckless driving under hazardous conditions is ongoing. The Kajaani Police Department remains vigilant in ensuring road safety amidst challenging weather scenarios.
