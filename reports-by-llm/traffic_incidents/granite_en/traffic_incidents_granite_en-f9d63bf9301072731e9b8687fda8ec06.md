**Traffic Incident Report**

*Incident Number:* 2024-HAN-001  
*Date of Incident:* 14th January 2024  
*Location:* Intersection of Kauppakatu and Mäkelänkatu, Hankasalmi, Finland  
*Reporting Officer:* Inspector Jouko Rantala  

**Narrative:**

On the afternoon of 14th January 2024, at approximately 14:30 hours, a two-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Mäkelänkatu in Hankasalmi, Finland. The incident involved a grey 2018 Volvo V60, registered with the license plate 923-YOK, driven by Mr. Mikko Kivinen, a 45-year-old local resident, and a white 2020 Toyota Corolla, bearing the license plate 123-HEL, operated by Ms. Anna Pitkänen, a 30-year-old teacher from nearby Savonlinna.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **14:25 hours:** Mr. Kivinen, driving north on Kauppakatu towards the intersection, approached at a moderate speed, adhering to the 50 km/h speed limit due to dry but cold road conditions. Ms. Pitkänen, traveling east on Mäkelänkatu, prepared to turn left onto Kauppakatu.

- **14:28 hours:** As Mr. Kivinen neared the intersection, Ms. Pitkänen initiated her left turn without yielding to oncoming traffic, as per Finnish Road Traffic Act, Section 56. Mr. Kivinen, unable to avoid a collision, applied his brakes but was unable to prevent impact due to the slippery nature of the dry yet cold asphalt.

- **14:30 hours:** The vehicles collided at the intersection. The Volvo struck the passenger side of the Corolla, causing significant damage to both vehicles. Mr. Kivinen and Ms. Pitkänen sustained minor injuries and were transported to Hämeenkyrki Hospital for evaluation.

**Witnesses:**

Two pedestrians, Mr. Jari Lehtinen and Ms. Laura Miettinen, witnessed the incident from a nearby café on Kauppakatu. They reported that Ms. Pitkänen failed to fully check her right for approaching traffic before initiating her turn.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The weather on the day of the incident was dry with temperatures around -5°C. Although there was no precipitation, the roads were slick due to overnight freezing, contributing to reduced traction for both vehicles.

**Vehicle Damage:**

- The Volvo V60 sustained damage primarily to its front end, including a crumpled hood and damaged headlights. The passenger side door was severely dented from the impact with the Corolla.

- The Toyota Corolla experienced significant damage on its passenger side, with a bent passenger door, a shattered side window, and substantial front-end collision marks.

**Conclusion:**

The investigation concluded that Ms. Pitkänen's failure to yield the right of way resulted in this avoidable collision. Both drivers were cited for traffic violations—Ms. Pitkänen for failing to yield and Mr. Kivinen for following too closely, though his citation reflects a secondary offense due to the unavoidable nature of the accident under the given conditions. No further action is warranted at this time.
