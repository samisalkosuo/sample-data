**Narrative:**

On the evening of 17th March 2024, at approximately 18:30 hours, a multi-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Pohjoiskarinkuunpuisto in Kannonkoski, Finland. The incident involved nine vehicles, resulting in various degrees of damage and minor injuries to the occupants.

The primary cause of the accident appears to be reduced visibility due to dense fog that enveloped the area during the evening hours. At the time, visibility was estimated to be less than 50 meters, significantly impairing drivers' ability to perceive and react to traffic signals and other vehicles.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **18:20 hours:** Fog began to descend over Kannonkoski, reducing visibility at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Pohjoiskarinkuunpuisto.
- **18:25 hours:** Initial reports from passing motorists indicated moderate fog conditions, with some drivers reducing speeds.
- **18:28 hours:** The first vehicle, a 2019 Volvo V60 driven by Mr. Mikko Koskinen, 34, of Kauppakatu 12, approached the intersection from the north on Kauppakatu.
- **18:29 hours:** A second vehicle, a 2020 Toyota Corolla driven by Ms. Anna Pitkänen, 27, of Pohjoiskarinkuunpuiston 34, proceeded through the intersection from the east on Pohjoiskarinkuunpuisto intending to turn left onto Kauppakatu.
- **18:30 hours:** The collision occurred as Ms. Pitkänen's vehicle entered the intersection, striking Mr. Koskinen’s Volvo. This initial impact triggered a chain reaction involving eight additional vehicles waiting or in motion at the intersection.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The prevailing weather condition at the time of the incident was foggy, with visibility reduced to approximately 50 meters. The road surface was dry but slippery due to the accumulation of fine fog particles, contributing to the difficulty drivers faced in maintaining control of their vehicles.

**Conclusion:**

The collision was primarily caused by hazardous driving conditions exacerbated by dense fog. All involved parties are cooperating with the investigation, and preliminary findings suggest that adherence to reduced speed limits in such weather conditions could have mitigated the severity of the incident. The Kannonkoski Police Department is working closely with local traffic authorities to review and enhance safety measures at this intersection, particularly during periods of poor visibility.
