**Traffic Incident Report**

*Incident Number:* 231014-SULKAVA-01  
*Date of Incident:* 14th October 2023  
*Location:* Intersection of Kauppakatu and Ratinkatu, Sulkava, Finland  
*Reporting Officer:* Inspector Jouko Hietala, Sulkava Police Department  

**Narrative:**

On the evening of 14th October 2023, at approximately 21:45 hours, a two-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ratinkatu in the municipality of Sulkava, Finland. The incident involved a grey 2018 Volvo V60, registered with the license plate 34-VLO-12, driven by Mr. Mikko Koskinen, a 35-year-old local resident of Kauppakatu 12, and a silver 2020 Toyota Corolla, identified by its license plate 12-TOY-98, operated by Ms. Anna Pitkänen, a 27-year-old residing at Ratinkatu 35.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **21:40 hours:** Ms. Pitkänen, driving her Toyota Corolla from the south on Ratinkatu towards the intersection, encountered windy conditions with occasional gusts, reducing visibility and making road conditions slippery.

- **21:42 hours:** Mr. Koskinen, proceeding north on Kauppakatu in his Volvo V60, approached the intersection intending to turn left onto Ratinkatu. The wind gusts caused his vehicle to drift slightly off course, partially entering the crosswalk.

- **21:43 hours:** Ms. Pitkänen, adhering to the speed limit despite the challenging weather, attempted to slow down for the stop sign at the intersection. However, due to reduced visibility from the wind and slippery road conditions, she failed to notice Mr. Koskinen's vehicle entering her path until it was too late.

- **21:44 hours:** The front passenger side of Ms. Pitkänen’s Corolla collided with the driver's side front of Mr. Koskinen’s Volvo, resulting in significant damage to both vehicles. Both drivers managed to bring their vehicles to a stop on the northeast quadrant of the intersection without further incident.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The prevailing weather at the time was windy with gusts, impacting visibility and road traction. The combination of darkness, wind-driven rain, and reduced friction from wet asphalt contributed to the challenging driving conditions that likely played a role in the collision.

**Vehicle Damage:**

The Volvo V60 sustained damage primarily to its driver's side front, including a dented front fender, a crumpled hood section, and a broken headlight. The Toyota Corolla incurred damage on its passenger side front, with a bent door, scrapes along the side panel, and a shattered side mirror.

**Witnesses:**

Two pedestrians, Mr. Jari Lehtinen and Ms. Laura Mäkelä, who were walking home from nearby grocery stores, witnessed the incident. They provided statements confirming the weather conditions and the sequence of events leading up to the collision.

**Conclusion:**

The collision was primarily caused by adverse weather conditions—strong winds with gusts—which impaired both drivers' visibility and control over their vehicles. No evidence suggests driver negligence beyond the challenging circumstances. Both drivers were wearing seatbelts and sustained minor injuries, treated on-site by emergency medical services before being transported to Sulkava Central Hospital for further evaluation.

This report is submitted for review and further investigation as necessary. Further inquiries can be directed to Inspector Jouko Hietala at the Sulkava Police Department.
