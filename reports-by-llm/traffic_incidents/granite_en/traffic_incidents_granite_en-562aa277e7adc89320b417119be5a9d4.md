**Narrative:**

On the morning of 25th May 2025, at approximately 08:45 hours, a two-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ruotsalanpuro in the municipality of Hattula, Finland. The incident involved a grey 2019 Toyota Corolla, registered with the license plate '345-FIN-A', driven by Mr. Mikko Kivinen, a 38-year-old local resident of Ruotsalanpuro 12, and a silver 2020 Ford Focus, identified by its registration '789-FIN-B', operated by Ms. Anna Pitkänen, a 25-year-old residing at Kauppakatu 45.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **08:30 hours:** Ms. Pitkänen, driving the Ford Focus, proceeds northbound on Kauppakatu towards Ruotsalanpuro, approaching the intersection with a green light.
- **08:32 hours:** Mr. Kivinen, in the Toyota Corolla, travels eastbound on Ruotsalanpuro, intending to turn left onto Kauppakatu. He pauses at the stop sign, observing Ms. Pitkänen's vehicle approaching from his right.
- **08:34 hours:** As Ms. Pitkänen enters the intersection, Mr. Kivinen initiates his left turn, misjudging the speed and proximity of Ms. Pitkänen’s vehicle due to heavy thunderstorm conditions reducing visibility.
- **08:35 hours:** The Ford Focus collides with the passenger side of the Toyota Corolla, causing significant damage to both vehicles. Ms. Pitkänen sustains minor injuries, while Mr. Kivinen reports no apparent injuries but appears visibly shaken.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The morning was marked by a severe thunderstorm, with heavy rainfall and reduced visibility due to lightning flashes. The road surfaces were wet, contributing to the slippery conditions that likely affected both drivers' ability to maintain control of their vehicles.

**Vehicle Damage Description:**

- The Toyota Corolla, driven by Mr. Kivinen, suffered substantial damage on its passenger side, including a dented door, a shattered side window, and scrapes along the vehicle's length from the point of impact.
- The Ford Focus, operated by Ms. Pitkänen, sustained front-end damage, with a crumpled hood, a damaged headlight, and scratches on its driver’s side corresponding to the area of contact with the Corolla.

**Witnesses:**

Two passersby, Mr. Jari Hietala from Kauppakatu 30 and Ms. Laura Rantanen from Ruotsalanpuro 8, witnessed the incident and provided statements corroborating the sequence of events. They noted the poor visibility caused by the thunderstorm and the suddenness with which the collision occurred.

**Conclusion:**

The collision appears to have resulted primarily from Mr. Kivinen's misjudgment of Ms. Pitkänen’s speed, exacerbated by adverse weather conditions. Both drivers were cooperative during the investigation, and no further parties are implicated at this time. The vehicles have been towed to a secure location for further examination, and both drivers have been advised to seek medical attention for Ms. Pitkänen's minor injuries.
