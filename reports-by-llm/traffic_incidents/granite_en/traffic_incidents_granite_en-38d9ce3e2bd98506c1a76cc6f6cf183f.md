*Incident Number:* 2024-Tam-0724-01  
*Date of Incident:* 24th July 2024  
*Location:* Intersection of Oulu Street and Helsinki Avenue, Tampere, Finland  
*Reporting Officer:* Inspector Jouko Mäki, Tampere Police Department  

**Narrative:**

On the evening of 24th July 2024, at approximately 18:30 hours, a multi-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Oulu Street and Helsinki Avenue in Tampere. The incident involved eleven vehicles, resulting in various degrees of damage and minor injuries to the drivers and passengers.

The primary cause of the accident appears to be a combination of factors including light rain, which reduced visibility, and potential driver distraction or misjudgment. 

**Timeline of Events:**

- **18:25 hours:** A light rain began falling in Tampere, reducing visibility on the roads.

- **18:28 hours:** Vehicle 1 (a blue 2020 Toyota Corolla, license plate 3456-FIN) was traveling eastbound on Oulu Street approaching the intersection with Helsinki Avenue. The driver, Mr. Mikko Kivinen, 32, of nearby Pispala, was reportedly distracted by a mobile device.

- **18:29 hours:** Vehicle 2 (a red 2018 Ford Focus, license plate 7890-FIN), driven by Ms. Anna Pitkänen, 25, from central Tampere, was proceeding northbound on Helsinki Avenue. She reportedly failed to notice the approaching Corolla due to the adverse weather conditions.

- **18:30 hours:** The Corolla entered the intersection against a red light, colliding with the Focus at approximately 45 degrees. This initial impact triggered a chain reaction.

- **18:30 - 18:32 hours:** Eleven subsequent vehicles were involved in the collision as they attempted to avoid or navigate through the initial crash site. These included a grey 2022 Volvo V60 (license plate 1234-FIN), a white 2019 Honda Civic (license plate 5678-FIN), and others, causing significant disarray at the intersection.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The prevailing weather condition during the incident was light rain, which reduced visibility and made road surfaces slippery. While not severe enough to warrant road closure under normal circumstances, it contributed to driver misjudgment and reaction times being compromised.

**Vehicle Details and Damages:**

1. **Toyota Corolla (3456-FIN):** Sustained substantial frontal damage, airbags deployed. Driver, Mikko Kivinen, sustained minor injuries.
   
2. **Ford Focus (7890-FIN):** Front-end collision with the Corolla, resulting in cosmetic and mechanical damage. Passenger, Anna Pitkänen, reported mild whiplash.

3. **Volvo V60 (1234-FIN):** Rear-ended by a following vehicle while stopped at the intersection, causing moderate rear damage. Driver, Olli Miettinen, 47, from Lempäälä, was unharmed.

4. **Honda Civic (5678-FIN):** Side impact with another vehicle while attempting to navigate around the central crash, leading to side panel damage. Passenger, Sanna Rantanen, 29, experienced minor cuts from broken glass.

**Witness Statements:**

Several pedestrians and occupants of nearby buildings provided statements corroborating the sequence of events. Notably, Ms. Kaisa Hietala, a resident at 123 Oulu Street, reported seeing the Corolla run the red light just before the collision.

**Conclusion:**

The incident was primarily caused by driver negligence exacerbated by adverse weather conditions. All parties involved were accountable for their actions, though Mr. Kivinen's distraction played a pivotal role in initiating the chain of events. No fatalities occurred, and all injuries were classified as minor. 

This report is submitted for further investigation and potential traffic law enforcement action against the drivers cited for negligence.
