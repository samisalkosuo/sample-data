**Narrative:**

On the morning of 22 September 2023, at approximately 08:45, a two-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kauppakatu and Ratinkatu in Hyrynsalmi. The incident involved a grey 2019 Toyota Corolla, registered with the license plate 34-YHK-12, driven by Mr. Petteri Hietanen, a local bakery owner residing at 23 Kauppakatu, and a silver 2020 Ford Focus, registered with the license plate 12-FOF-98, operated by Ms. Anna-Liisa Koskinen, a school teacher from 56 Ratinkatu.

**Timeline of Events:**

- **08:37**: Mr. Hietanen, driving east on Kauppakatu towards the intersection, approached the stop sign. Ms. Koskinen, travelling north on Ratinkatu, was also nearing the intersection. Visibility was moderately reduced due to overcast weather conditions, with light drizzle adding to the challenge of clear sightlines.

- **08:39**: As Mr. Hietanen prepared to proceed, he reportedly checked his rearview mirror and then proceeded into the intersection without yielding to Ms. Koskinen's vehicle, which was approaching from the right under the same overcast conditions.

- **08:40**: The front passenger side of Ms. Koskinen’s Ford Focus collided with the driver's side front of Mr. Hietanen’s Toyota Corolla. Both vehicles came to a stop, partially blocking the intersection.

**Witnesses and Additional Information:**

- A passerby, Mr. Jari Pitkäranta, who was walking his dog along Kauppakatu, witnessed the incident and immediately called emergency services at 08:42. He reported that both drivers appeared shaken but uninjured.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The morning was characterized by overcast skies with light drizzle, reducing visibility slightly. The roads were damp but not icy, contributing to the reduced traction that might have affected braking distances.

**Vehicle Damage:**

- The Toyota Corolla sustained damage to its front passenger side, including a dented door and scratches along the side panel. Airbag deployment was noted, indicating a potential impact force.
  
- The Ford Focus showed significant damage to its front driver's side, with a crumpled hood and front bumper. The airbag had also deployed in this vehicle.

**Action Taken:**

Emergency services arrived at 08:47 and confirmed that neither driver sustained injuries beyond minor shock. Both vehicles were towed from the scene for inspection and repair. No further action was deemed necessary at this time, pending insurance claims and potential traffic violation citations for failure to yield.
