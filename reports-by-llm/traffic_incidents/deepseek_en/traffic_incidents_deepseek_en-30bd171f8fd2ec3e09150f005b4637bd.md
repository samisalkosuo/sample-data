This report outlines the traffic incident that occurred on Tuesday, 15th July 2024, involving four vehicles. The collision took place in the area of Kruunusillat near the city center during the morning hours, with light rain contributing to reduced visibility and slippery road conditions.

**Timeline of Events:**  
At approximately 7:30 AM, driver A (a 45-year-old male) entered the intersection from Kruunusillat onto Kruunusillan Rintamaa. Moments later, driver B (a 38-year-old female) failed to yield to driver C (a 29-year-old male), resulting in a head-on collision between their respective vehicles: a 2015 Toyota Camry and a 2017 Ford Transit. The impact caused both vehicles to skid into a tree located on the outskirts of the intersection, sustaining significant damage.

Subsequent attempts by driver D (a 32-year-old female) in her 2016 Honda CR-V to navigate the scene were hindered by debris and water from the crash, leading to an impasse. Attempts to extricate driver C resulted in minor injuries requiring first aid. Driver B was uninjured but reported feeling shaken.
