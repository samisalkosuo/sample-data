At approximately 10:30 PM local time, a collision occurred on Rautaharjo Street in the vicinity of Kruunusillat Yhteisrakka. The incident involved two vehicles: a Toyota Yaris (Vehicle ID A1B) and a Ford Transit (Vehicle ID C2D). 

The driver of the Toyota Yaris, Mr. Antti Nieminen (34), reported experiencing difficulty in controlling his vehicle due to the strong winds at night. He sustained minor injuries, including a cut on his hand from a dent caused by the impact. The passenger, Ms. Anna Lehto (29), was uninjured.

The Ford Transit driver, Mr. Pertti Kivinen (45), reported no physical injuries but felt the impact of the collision had left him disoriented. His passenger, Ms. Riina Nieminen (31), also remained unharmed.

Eyewitness accounts from bystanders near the scene corroborated the drivers' descriptions: Mr. Nieminen was seen swerving erratically before losing control and colliding with the Ford Transit. Witnesses noted that visibility was reduced by both the night and strong winds, contributing to the accident.

Upon arrival at the scene, Finnish police officers and traffic investigators assessed the damage. The Toyota Yaris sustained moderate front-end damage, including a dent in the driver's side and a slightly damaged rear window. The Ford Transit reported minor front bumper damage.

The investigation revealed that Mr. Kivinen was driving under normal conditions without any known alcohol or fatigue issues. Further analysis of road conditions indicated that the strong winds had significantly impacted visibility and vehicle control during the evening commute.

**Conclusion:**  
The collision appeared to be a case of unavoidable circumstances exacerbated by adverse weather conditions. Both drivers were interviewed, and their statements were consistent with each other and corroborated by eyewitness accounts.

**Recommendation:**  
The incident is reported for review by local traffic authorities. Further investigation into driving conditions during the evening hours in Kerava is advised to prevent future incidents.
