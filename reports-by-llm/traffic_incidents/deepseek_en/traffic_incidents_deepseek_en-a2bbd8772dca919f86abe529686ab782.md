### **Weather and Road Conditions**
The incident occurred during a foggy morning with mist covering much of the area. Visibility dropped below 500 meters shortly after the collision due to reduced light reflection from the fogged-up windshield and poor road markings. The weather conditions exacerbated driving difficulties, leading both drivers to reduce their speed and rely heavily on brake systems.

### **Event Timeline**

   - Both vehicles were traveling in the same direction on a narrow, single-lane residential road near Jomala.  

2. **Collision:**

   - Both drivers were stopped at the gas station shortly after the collision, with no apparent signs of forced entry or fire.

### **Witnesses**

### **Conclusion**
