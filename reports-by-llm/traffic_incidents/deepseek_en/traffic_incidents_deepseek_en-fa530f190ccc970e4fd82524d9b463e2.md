### **Narrative Description:**

At approximately 10:30 AM, a collision occurred on the outskirts of Vimpeli, involving two vehicles. The primary vehicle involved was a medium-sized passenger car traveling eastbound on Vimpelisen Rautatie (Main Road), while the secondary vehicle was a large truck heading westbound on the same road. The driver of the car, **Mr. Antti Nieminen** (age 34, from Helsinki), reported that he had been commuting to his parents' house in Vimpeli for the weekend. The passenger, **Elina Lehto** (28 years old), was traveling with her young son, **Mikko Lehto** (1 year old). 

The truck driver, **Simo Kivinen** (45 years old, from Pori), was returning to his home in Lapland after a day of work. His passenger, **Anna Kivinen** (36 years old), was traveling with her elderly father, **Olli Kivinen** (70 years old). The accident occurred shortly after the truck had entered the village and began slowing down due to what appeared to be a sudden patch of ice on the road. 

As the car approached the scene, it lost control and collided head-on with the truck. The impact resulted in severe front-end damage to both vehicles, with debris flying across the road and blocking visibility for several hundred meters. Witnesses reported that the scene was initially obscured by snow and slush, making it difficult to assess the situation until emergency services arrived.

### **Weather and Road Conditions:**

The weather conditions at the time of the collision were snowy, with light snowfall mixed with rain. The accumulation on the road created a slippery surface, particularly noticeable in the lower sections of Vimpelisen Rautatie near the village entrance. Snow tires had been recommended earlier that day due to the forecasted cold, but many drivers on the road had failed to prepare for the impending snowfall.

The truck driver reported that he had not applied his brakes as instructed and instead had relied on natural braking due to the reduced traction caused by the snowy conditions. The car driver stated that she was following too closely behind her parents' house when the sudden ice patch caused her vehicle to lose control.

### **Vehicle Damage:**

The primary vehicle sustained severe front-end damage, with the bumper and grille completely demolished. The windscreen was shattered, and the left side of the car was dented beyond recognition. The truck, while not severely damaged in terms of structural integrity, had its rear wheels completely spun out due to the loss of control during braking.

### **Witness Statements:**

A witness on the scene, **Jouko Kivinen** (40 years old), stated that he had been traveling eastbound on Vimpelisen Rautatie when he noticed the sudden deceleration of the truck. He described seeing the debris scattered across the road and reported the collision to the authorities immediately.

---

### **Conclusion:**

The collision appeared to be a high-speed, head-on accident exacerbated by the adverse weather conditions. Both drivers were uninjured at the time of the incident, but the collision caused significant damage to both vehicles. The truck driver was advised to seek medical attention for potential injuries to his back and neck, while the car driver reported no immediate health concerns.

The incident is under investigation by the local police, with a focus on determining the exact cause of the collision and identifying any contributing factors such as alcohol or fatigue.
