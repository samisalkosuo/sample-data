### Overview

On the evening of April 23, 2024, a tragic traffic incident occurred in Vårdö, involving eight vehicles. The accident took place on Kylänti Street, a quiet residential area known for its scenic beauty but also notorious for its challenging weather conditions.

### Narrative Description

At approximately 19:30, the situation began to deteriorate as weather conditions worsened from mild evening light to a mix of rain and snow. Vaskilahti, a local driver, reported that visibility had reduced significantly due to low temperatures and heavy precipitation, making it difficult for drivers to maintain control of their vehicles.

The accident occurred on Kylänti Street, near the intersection with Rautakirjankatu. Vaskilahti was traveling eastbound when his vehicle, a 2018 Toyota Matrix, collided head-on with a 2017 Ford Transit Cargo Van operated by Lehtimaahti. The collision ejected several passengers from both vehicles.

The impact of the weather worsened the situation further. Kylänti Street was slick andicy, especially in areas near the accident site. This made it difficult for drivers to stop or maneuver, contributing to the severity of the incident.

### Witness Statements

1. **Oksalahti** reported seeing the collision from her apartment on Rautakirjankatu. She described hearing multiple car crashes and saw Vaskilahti's vehicle skidding off the road before the impact with the Transit Cargo Van.
2. **Mustonen** stated that she was traveling westbound on Kylänti Street when she noticed the accident ahead of her. She described heavy rain and slippery conditions, which made it difficult to assess the situation.

### Vehicle Damage

- **Vaskilahti's Toyota Matrix:** Severe front-end damage from the collision, with significant deformation and internal injuries.
- **Lehtimaahti's Ford Transit Cargo Van:** Partially destroyed front bumper and side impact damage. The van was heavily damaged by water from the rain.
- **Additional Vehicles Involved:**
  - A 2016 Peugeot 308 sustained minor front-end dents but remained operational.
  - A 2015 Citroën Crossberg incurred minor damage to its bumper and side mirror.
  - Two smaller vehicles, a 2014 Suzuki Alto and a 2017 Peugeot 107, were mostly undamaged but had scuffs from the collision.

### Conclusion

The incident resulted in multiple injuries among the passengers of the involved vehicles. Vaskilahti was unhurt but reported discomfort due to the accident. The other drivers and passengers sustained minor injuries, primarily from the impact and weather conditions.

This report highlights the dangers of driving under adverse weather conditions and the importance of maintaining control when visibility is compromised. Further investigation into the cause of the collision is ongoing.
