At approximately 08:15 local time on Wednesday, 20th June 2023, a traffic incident occurred near the intersection of Kruunusillat Street and Rautakirjallinen Street in Paltamo. The scene involved three vehicles, with injuries reported to two individuals.

The driver of vehicle number 1 (a Toyota Yaris) was observed driving erratically on a snow-covered road. Witnesses reported that Maria, the driver, lost control while attempting a sharp left turn onto Kruunusillat Street. The vehicle skidded off the road and struck an obstruction consisting of a tree branch located near the intersection.

The second vehicle (a Ford Transit) was traveling in the opposite direction when it came to a sudden stop due to losing sight of the oncoming traffic caused by the snow. The driver, Juhani, sustained injuries to his knee and was treated at the scene.

A third vehicle (a Vantaa City Van) remained stationary after being struck from behind by an object. Witnesses noted debris near the van, possibly from a previous accident involving construction equipment.

Weather conditions at the time included light snowfall with reduced visibility, contributing to the drivers' inability to perceive their surroundings accurately. Snow tires were installed on all vehicles involved but failed to prevent the incidents due to insufficient traction.

The investigation revealed that Maria was operating under the influence of alcohol, as indicated by blood tests conducted post-incident. Authorities are collaborating with local roadworks scheduled for later in the day, which include repaving of Rautakirjallinen Street.

This report outlines the facts as they were understood at the time of investigation. Further details will be provided upon completion of the official inquiry.
