At approximately 19:30 hours, the Finnish National Road Administration received a report of an accident involving two motor vehicles on Rautakyl√§nti, Laukaa. The scene was observed by officers at the scene and subsequent to arrival, further investigation was conducted.

Weather conditions at the time included heavy rain, which significantly impacted visibility and road traction. The accident occurred on a narrow, winding road where hydroplaning was suspected due to the slippery conditions.

**Timeline of Events:**

1. **Incident Report Received:** 19:30 hours  
   - The National Road Administration received a call reporting an accident between two vehicles near Kruunusillat intersection.

2. **Emergency Response:**  
   - Police arrived at the scene and assessed the situation, finding both vehicles had lost control due to hydroplaning on the wet road.

3. **Collision Occurred:**  
   - The collision happened approximately 1 hour later (20:45 hours) when the driver of a Toyota Camry attempted to navigate the slippery road ahead, losing control and colliding with a Tesla Model Y traveling in the opposite direction.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**  
Heavy rain caused significant hydroplaning on the road surface. Visibility was reduced to less than 20 meters, making it difficult for drivers to maintain control of their vehicles.

**Vehicles Involved:**

1. **Toyota Camry (Driver: Olli Kivinen):**  
   - Model year: 2018  
   - License plate: FI-999AB-C78  

2. **Tesla Model Y (Driver: Riikka Jokinen):**  
   - Model year: 2023  
   - License plate: FI-555CD-E4F  

**Damage Descriptions:**  
The Toyota Camry sustained extensive front-end damage, with the bumper and grille severely deformed. The Tesla Model Y experienced rear-wheel hydroplaning, resulting in water pooling around its axles.

**Statements from Participants:**

1. **Driver of Toyota Camry (Olli Kivinen):**  
   - "I was trying to avoid hydroplaning but couldn't control the car anymore."

2. **Driver of Tesla Model Y (Riikka Jokinen):**

**Conclusion:**  
The police investigation revealed that both vehicles were severely damaged. Further investigation is ongoing into potential alcohol or drug use by either driver, as such factors are common contributors under heavy rain conditions.

**Next Steps:**  
- Collision reconstruction will be conducted to determine fault.
- Medical examinations of all parties involved will follow.
- The National Road Administration will assess if further intervention is necessary.
