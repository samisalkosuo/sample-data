### Timeline of Events  

- **19:20**: The incident began when Eeva Kivipelto (Vehicle 1) entered the narrow gravel road to pick up her children. She failed to negotiate the curve due to heavy rain and alcohol, swerving to avoid an oncoming vehicle.

- **19:35**: Mika Salo (Vehicle 2) was traveling at approximately 80 km/h when his van lost control while overtaking a slower-moving truck in the snowstorm. The collision ejected several passengers from the van onto the road.

- **19:40**: Sari-Pekka Kivinen (Vehicle 3) was driving a heavily loaded cargo trailer on an already icy and wet road. The truck skidded off the road, causing a chain reaction with Vehicle 2, which then caught fire due to the heavy rain and friction from the wet road surfaces.

- **19:45**: The fire originating from Vehicle 1 spread rapidly towards the van, causing it to burst into flames. The car sustained significant damage, including smoke and scorched interior materials.

- **19:50**: The truck caught fire as well, with the rear tyre punctured by the flames. The driver managed to control the vehicle but was unable to extricate himself from the burning wreckage.

### Weather and Road Conditions  

The incident occurred under heavy rain (approximately 30 mm/h) combined with strong winds (gusts up to 45 km/h). The rain reduced visibility significantly, making drivers unable to see more than 50 meters ahead. The gravel road had been coated with ice from the night snowstorm earlier in the week, exacerbating the slippery conditions.

### Damage Description  

- **Vehicle 1 (Toyota Camry)**: Front bumper and side windows sustained minor damage. The car caught fire due to the heat generated by the burning van and subsequent chain reaction.

- **Vehicle 2 (Honda Element)**: Rear grille and side mirrors were deformed. The van caught fire, with smoke spreading rapidly towards the passenger compartment.

- **Vehicle 3 (Freightliner Cascadia)**: Front axle tyre was punctured, causing the truck to skid off the road. The vehicle caught fire on impact, with flames reaching up to the cab.

### Statements from Parties Involved  

1. **Eeva Kivipelto**: "I didn't see anything coming at me; I just swerved to avoid the other car and ended up in a collision."  

2. **Mika Salo**: "I was going too fast for these conditions, especially with the snowstorm earlier this week. I couldn't control the van anymore."  

3. **Sari-Pekka Kivinen**: "The truck almost hit me when it lost control; I had to brake hard to avoid hitting the van. The fire started in the back of the truck quickly."  

4. **Witnesses**: Several witnesses reported seeing smoke from Vehicle 1 and hearing multiple impacts before the fire started. One witness stated, "I saw a bright plume of smoke coming from the car; it looked like it was on fire."

### Conclusion  

The traffic incident involved three vehicles: a passenger car, a van, and a truck. The collision occurred due to a combination of alcohol-related driving (Eeva Kivipelto), excessive speed (Mika Salo), and poor road conditions exacerbated by heavy rain and strong winds (Sari-Pekka Kivinen). The fire caused significant damage to all three vehicles, with the passenger car sustaining the most severe burns. Initial investigations revealed that Eeva Kivipelto was driving under the influence of alcohol at the time of the collision.
