### Weather and Road Conditions:

The incident occurred during a windy night with gusts reaching 20 m/s, creating an azeotropic driving condition where visibility was reduced to less than 20 meters. The narrow street in Salo, known for its winding roads and lake views, exacerbated the situation, making it difficult for drivers to maintain control.

The road surface near the collision site had recently experienced light snowfall, resulting in slippery patches despite not being heavily icy. This contributed to the reduced visibility and vehicle control during the night.

### Vehicle Models and Damage:

- **Toyota Yaris (John Doe):** Damage includes bent front headlights, bumper damage, and minor front-end deformation.
- **Truck (Jane Smith):** Rear-end damage with a busted tailgate and crushed side mirror. The truck sustained moderate front-end deformation.

Both vehicles were registered in Finland, with respective license plates: A1234 for the Yaris and B5678 for the truck.

### Conclusion:

The collision at "Lakelands" on January 27, 2025, was attributed to a combination of factors. John Doe, driving under the influence of strong winds and reduced visibility, failed to maintain control of his vehicle, leading to an unavoidable collision with Jane Smith's truck.

Both drivers were interviewed by Finnish law enforcement, who determined that speeding was a contributing factor due to the challenging nighttime conditions. Jane Smith was not at fault, as she appeared to have exercised reasonable caution given the circumstances.

The case is closed with both parties' insurance details confirmed for further legal proceedings.
