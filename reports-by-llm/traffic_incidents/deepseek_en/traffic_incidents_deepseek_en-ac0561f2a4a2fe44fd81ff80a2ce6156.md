This report outlines a traffic incident that occurred on the evening of January 28, 2024, in Ilomantsi, Finland. The collision involved seven vehicles, all of which were struck simultaneously at approximately 19:30 local time (17:30 UTC). The incident took place near the intersection of Kumpula Street and Rautakirjoki Lane, a busy area known for its pedestrian activity and commercial complexes.

### Weather and Road Conditions  
The evening was marked by overcast skies, with intermittent visibility due to mist. Visibility was reduced to approximately 200 meters under optimal driving conditions, making drivers reliant on their headlights or side mirrors for safety. The rain, which had been ongoing earlier in the day, continued into the evening, contributing to hydroplaning and reduced traction on the roads.

### Timeline of Events  
1. **19:30:** Driver A (a 45-year-old male) was traveling northbound on Kumpula Street in his Toyota Camry, approaching the intersection with Rautakirjoki Lane from the west. The vehicle appeared to lose control due to hydroplaning caused by the wet路面 and entered a skid.
   
2. **19:35:** Driver B (a 38-year-old male) operating an SUV (Mercedes-Benz G-Class) was traveling eastbound on Rautakirjoki Lane when his vehicle was struck from behind by a large truck (Truck model: Freightliner Cascadia) traveling westbound on the same road. The impact caused both vehicles to skid further into the intersection.
   
3. **19:40:** A third vehicle, a small business van (Volkswagen Vanagon), driven by Driver C (a 25-year-old male), was struck from the side by an electric scooter (E-Scooter) operated by Driver D (a 19-year-old male). The scooter failed to yield right-of-way at the intersection and collided with the van, causing it to spin out.
   
4. **19:45:** A fourth vehicle, a two-seater sports car (Porsche Boxster), driven by Driver E (a 32-year-old female) traveling southbound on Kumpula Street, was struck from above by an older model sedan (Hyundai Sonata) operated by Driver F (a 40-year-old male). The impact resulted in both vehicles skidding into the intersection.
   
5. **19:50:** A fifth vehicle, a construction truck (Dongfeng HOWO), driven by Driver G (a 55-year-old male), was struck from behind by a large pickup truck (Tundra) operated by Driver H (a 37-year-old female). The collision caused the truck to spin and skid into the intersection.
   
6. **19:55:** A sixth vehicle, a bicycle ( mtb), driven by Driver I (a 20-year-old male), was struck from behind by an older model motorcycle (Honda CB300F) operated by Driver J (a 28-year-old female). The impact caused the bike to tip over and skid into the intersection.
   
7. **19:58:** A seventh vehicle, a large commercial van (Mitsubishi Fuso), driven by Driver K (a 48-year-old male) traveling westbound on Rautakirjoki Lane, was struck from the rear by an older model car (Ford Focus RS) operated by Driver L (a 35-year-old female).
