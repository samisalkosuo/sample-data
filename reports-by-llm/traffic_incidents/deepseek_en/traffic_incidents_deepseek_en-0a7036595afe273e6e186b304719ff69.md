*Date: 19 July 2024*  
*Municipality: Rantasalmi, Finland*

At approximately 23:30 local time, an unfortunately severe traffic incident occurred on the evening of 19 July 2024 in Rantasalmi. The collision involved six vehicles, including three passenger cars, a light truck, and a city bus. The incident was exacerbated by wet and slippery road conditions, which significantly impacted drivers' visibility and control.

The scene was captured by witness Kalle, who resides nearby at the shop on Säätöntekijänlahti Street. Kalle reported that he saw the accident unfold shortly after 21:00 when a silver car traveling westbound on Kruunusillat Ylittäväinen Street lost control due to hydroplaning, skidding onto the shoulder, and colliding with another vehicle ahead.

Witness Liisa, operating an orange truck on Leikkausjoki Road, stated that she was driving at a moderate speed when her truck came to rest on its side mirrors after hydroplaning. She observed the collision sequence as follows: "First, I saw the white car skidding onto the shoulder; then, it hit another vehicle from behind, which rolled over and ended up in the median. Moments later, our truck slid off the road into a parked bus stop bench."

The lead vehicle, identified as a dark blue sedan, had hydroplaned on its side windows due to the slippery conditions. The driver of this vehicle attempted to regain control but lost it entirely, leading to a chain reaction with subsequent vehicles. The collision cascaded down the road, resulting in multiple injuries among the occupants.

Passenger Emma, age 28, from Helsinki, sustained minor injuries including a broken leg and a sprained ankle after being struck by the silver car. Driver Olli, age 45, reported that he was traveling at approximately 60 km/h when he lost control of his orange truck due to hydroplaning.

The city bus, traveling eastbound on Kruunusillat Ylittäväinen Street, remained stationary after being struck from behind by the silver car. The driver of the light truck reported that she was not impaired and had just entered the scene when the accident occurred.

Following the collision, all involved parties were interviewed, and medical examinations were conducted. The investigation revealed that alcohol consumption was a contributing factor due to the wet conditions, which made drivers less responsive to visual cues.

The incident led to significant injuries among several occupants and substantial damage to the vehicles involved. Legal actions are now being pursued against those responsible for the accident.

This report is a factual summary based on witness accounts, vehicle inspections, and scene analysis conducted by the local traffic police unit in Rantasalmi. Further investigation is ongoing to determine the exact cause and liability of the incident.
