At approximately 1:30 AM local time, an tragic multi-vehicle accident occurred on the residential area's main road near the Kemiönsaari town center. The incident involved **eleven vehicles**, including passenger cars, a light truck, and a couple of motorcycles. The collision resulted in severe injuries to several individuals, as well as substantial damage to the affected vehicles.

### **Accident Scene**  
The accident originated from an unexpected act of caution on a dark, wet road surface. A driver, identified as **Mikko Lehto**, was traveling northbound on the main road when he failed to yield to a pedestrian crossing in his lane. The pedestrian, **Anna Kivinen**, was crossing the road at her own discretion and did not perceive the vehicle's presence in time.

### **Witness Account**  
Eyewitnesses reported that the driver of another vehicle, **Eeva Niinimaa**, traveling westbound on the same road, had attempted to swerve away from the collision but lost control due to the slippery conditions. This action caused a chain reaction, leading to the pile-up involving multiple vehicles.

### **Weather and Road Conditions**  
The wet and slippery terrain played a significant role in the incident. The reduced visibility and decreased friction on the road surface made it difficult for drivers to maintain control of their vehicles, especially under the influence of alcohol or fatigue.

### **Vehicle Damage and Identification**  
- **Vehicles Involved**:  
  - A **Toyota Camry** (white with dark accents) sustained moderate front-end damage. The license plate was **AB12345**.  
  - A **Honda Civic** (red with silver trim) had its left fender damaged and required replacement. The license plate was **DE67890**.  
  - A **Suzuki SX4** (black with metallic highlights) incurred minor damage to its front wheel. The license plate was **FG23456**.  
  - Additional vehicles, including a light truck and two motorcycles, were also damaged in the collision.

### **Investigation Findings**  
The investigation revealed that **Mikko Lehto** was driving under the influence of alcohol, which contributed to his inability to perceive the pedestrian crossing. Furthermore, **Eeva Niinimaa**, who had previously been involved in another minor traffic violation, exhibited signs of fatigue, exacerbating her inability to respond appropriately.

### **Conclusion**  
The multi-vehicle pile-up on Kemiönsaari's main road remains a preventable tragedy. The primary factors contributing to the incident were alcohol consumption and driver fatigue under adverse weather conditions. Authorities are recommending increased awareness campaigns in the area and stricter enforcement of traffic laws during wet weather.
