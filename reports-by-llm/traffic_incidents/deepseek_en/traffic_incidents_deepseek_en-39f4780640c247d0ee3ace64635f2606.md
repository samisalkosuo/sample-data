**Scene Description:**  
At approximately 15:30 local time, a collision occurred on Rautakirjallankatu near the intersection of Kruunusillat and Lehtisillat in Kiuruvesi. The scene was partially obscured by light rain, which affected visibility but did not hinder the investigation.

**Incident Details:**  
The incident involved two motor vehicles: a Toyota Camry (A1B 9876) driven by Maria Ahlström and a Ford Transit (Y3D 2345) operated by Olli Kivipelto. The collision occurred when the Toyota Camry, traveling eastbound on Rautakirjallankatu, lost control due to hydroplaning caused by the rain. The Ford Transit, which was traveling westbound on Lehtisillat, failed to yield and attempted to overtake, exacerbating the situation.

**Weather Conditions:**  
Light rain was present at the time of the incident, contributing to reduced visibility and slippery road conditions. This made it challenging for drivers to maintain control, particularly in the wet patches created by hydroplaning.

**Road Conditions:**  
The area near the collision site had experienced light rain earlier that day, resulting in hydrophobic surface conditions. The Toyota Camry's loss of traction was exacerbated by the rain, leading to an inability to steer effectively and ultimately a head-on collision with the Ford Transit.

**Vehicle Damage:**  
The Toyota Camry sustained front-end damage from the collision, including dents near the bumper area. The Ford Transit also incurred minor front-end damage but remained structurally sound following the impact.

**Witness Statements:**  
- **Anna Lehto (Eyewitness):** "I was crossing the road when I noticed a sudden swerve to my right. I looked back and saw Maria Ahlström's car veering towards Olli Kivipelto's vehicle. The rain made it extremely slippery, and both drivers seemed to lose control at the same time."
- **Pertti Soininen (Eyewitness):** "I was in the Ford Transit when Olli Kivipelto lost control suddenly. I thought he had hit a patch of water and tried to swerve, but it wasn't enough. The Toyota Camry came straight for me, and we both skidded hard before stopping."

**Conclusion:**  
The collision resulted from a combination of hydroplaning due to light rain and inadequate road conditions. Both drivers were at fault, as they failed to maintain control and yield appropriately. The investigation is ongoing to determine the exact cause and liability.
