### **Narrative of Events**

The incident took place on the Kruunusillat Yritysmaiden Rengas street, a main road in Pihtipudas, as part of a planned route for a local delivery service. The driver of the first vehicle, Mr. Pertti Nieminen (age 42), was traveling northbound towards the city center when he encountered heavy rain and reduced visibility.

Mr. Nieminen, operating a Toyota Hilux, attempted to navigate the slippery roads but lost control due to hydroplaning. He lost consciousness approximately 150 meters from his destination as the vehicle slid off the road into a shallow ditch on the shoulder.

Unbeknownst to Mr. Nieminen, the second driver, Ms. Salla Kallio (age 38), was en route to deliver medical supplies and had just entered her vehicle when she noticed the incident ahead. She attempted to brake gently but found herself unable to avoid the collision due to the hydroplaning conditions.

The Toyota Hilux collided head-on with a Honda Civic, operated by Mr. Pertti Nieminen's passenger, Mr. Juhani Paasiniemi (age 45). Both vehicles sustained significant damage, with the Honda Civic sustaining front-end injuries and the Toyota Hilux requiring extensive repair work to restore its hydrodynamic stability.

### **Weather and Road Conditions**

The evening of the incident was marked by heavy rain, which had started around 8 PM. The rain fell steadily throughout the night, creating a slippery surface on the roads. Visibility dropped below 200 meters within the first hour, making nighttime driving particularly challenging for drivers who relied on headlights.

The road conditions were exacerbated by potholes and debris scattered along the main road, further reducing traction and increasing hydroplaning risks.
