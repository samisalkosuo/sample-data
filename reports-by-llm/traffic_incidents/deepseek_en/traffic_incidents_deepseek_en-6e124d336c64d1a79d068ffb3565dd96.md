**Incident Summary**

On Monday, July 7, 2023, at approximately 7:15 AM, a traffic collision occurred near the lake area of Kruunusillat in Nurmes Municipality, Finland. The incident involved two vehicles: a passenger car and an SUV. The driver of the passenger car, Mikko Kivipelto (age 42), was traveling eastbound on Linnanmaa Street towards the accident site when he came to a sudden stop due to a pedestrian in his path.

**Timeline of Events**

1. **7:00 AM:** Mikko Kivipelto was driving his vehicle at a moderate speed on Linnanmaa Street, heading east.
2. **7:15 AM:** He noticed Emma Lindström (age 38), a pedestrian walking along the sidewalk near the lake, and stopped abruptly to avoid her.
3. **7:17 AM:** The collision occurred as Mikko attempted to navigate the stop sign at a traffic light located on Säätöntori Street, which was recently updated with new signs due to ongoing construction.

**Weather Conditions**

The incident took place under wet and slippery conditions. The weather forecast for that day predicted mist in the morning, increasing visibility slightly but not enough to eliminate the risk of hydroplaning or skidding. This contributed significantly to the accident as both vehicles lost control momentarily.

**Vehicle Details**

- **Passenger Car:** Model: Toyota Camry 2018, license plate A1B.
- **SUV:** Model: Honda CR-V 2020, license plate C3D.
- **Damage Description:** The passenger car sustained front-end damage with a minor crack on the bumper and a small dent in the side. The SUV experienced moderate front-end deformation, with the bumper completely ripped off and the front grille severely damaged.

**Witness Statements**

Anna Lehto, a witness who was nearby at the time, described seeing both vehicles involved in the collision. She noted that Mikko Kivipelto had stopped abruptly and then accelerated suddenly after the impact, potentially due to panic or distraction. Lehto also mentioned that Emma Lindström appeared unharmed but was concerned about her safety following the accident.

**Conclusion**

The investigation revealed that the primary cause of the collision was Mikko Kivipelto's sudden acceleration after stopping for a pedestrian. The wet and slippery road conditions exacerbated the situation, contributing to both the driver's reaction time issues and the vehicles' loss of control. Emma Lindström sustained minor injuries from the collision but remained conscious and unharmed.

This incident highlights the importance of maintaining safe driving practices, especially in adverse weather conditions, and underscores the need for improved pedestrian safety measures near vulnerable areas such as lakeside regions.
