*Date: 07.12.2024 (December 7, 2024)*  
*Municipality: Urjala, Finland*  

At approximately 07:15 AM local time, a traffic collision occurred on the intersection of *Uurgatan* and *Valtakunnan Kaupungintori* in Urjala. The incident involved two motor vehicles, specifically a 2018 Toyota Camry (Model: YL-123A) driven by Tuomas Ahola (45 years old) and a 2020 Honda Civic (Model: ZA-456B) operated by Riitta Kivipelto (38 years old).  

Weather conditions at the time included foggy skies, with visibility dropping to approximately 150 meters due to the onset of mist around 6:30 AM. This poor visibility made both drivers reliant on low-range headlights and resulted in aggressive driving behaviors, contributing to the accident.  

The collision occurred during a head-on scenario as Ahola attempted to decelerate suddenly upon approaching a red light at *Uurgatan*. Meanwhile, Kivipelto was navigating a curve on *Valtakunnan Kaupungintori* when her vehicle was struck from the side by Ahola's Camry.  

Eyewitness accounts from individuals nearby corroborated that both drivers appeared to be under the influence of alcohol and had lost control of their vehicles shortly before impact. Witness statements indicated that Ahola swerved erratically, while Kivipelto failed to yield due to panic, exacerbating the situation.  

Following the collision, emergency services arrived within 15 minutes, supported by local fire and police units. The scene was examined under ambient light following the defogging of the area. Evidence collected included both vehicles' damage, skid marks near *Uurgatan*, and witness statements recorded on field notes.  

The investigation revealed that Ahola was driving under the influence of alcohol, with a blood alcohol level exceeding the legal limit by 0.1 mg/mL. Kivipelto, however, maintained a blood alcohol level within permissible limits but exhibited signs of fatigue due to long-distance driving.  

Both drivers were interviewed and cooperated fully with the investigation. No charges have been filed at this stage, as the case is under scrutiny pending further evidence and legal proceedings. Authorities are directing both parties to attend a mediation session to resolve any outstanding issues.  

In conclusion, the collision was a result of aggressive driving combined with alcohol consumption by Ahola and fatigue by Kivipelto. Both drivers are cooperating fully with the investigation, and no immediate charges are anticipated at this time.
