### **Accident Summary**

On the morning of June 3, 2025, a traffic accident occurred at an intersection in Kauhava involving three vehicles. The incident was exacerbated by windy conditions with gusts, reducing visibility and contributing to the collision.

### **Weather and Road Conditions**

The weather on the morning of the incident was characterized by light to moderate winds, creating gusty conditions that affected visibility. The roads near the accident site were in fair condition, though reduced visibility made driving challenging for some vehicles involved.

### **Timeline of Events**

1. **First Vehicle (Tesla Model S):**  
   At approximately 7:20 AM, a Tesla Model S was observed approaching the intersection from the westbound lane on Kauhava Road. The driver appeared to stop at a red light at the traffic circle located at Kauhava Circle.

2. **Second Vehicle (Heavy-Duty Truck):**  
   Moments later, a Heavy-Duty Truck traveling north on Kauhava Road approached the same intersection from the opposite direction. The truck's driver observed the Tesla Model S stopped at the red light and proceeded to yield.

3. **Third Vehicle (City Van):**  
   Around the same time, a City Van was traveling east on Kauhava Road when it attempted to turn left onto Kauhava Street. The driver failed to stop in time due to the reduced visibility caused by the wind, leading to an unintended collision with the Tesla Model S.

### **Witness Statements**

- **Mr. Antti Nieminen:** A resident near Kauhava Circle reported hearing a sudden crash as the City Van collided with the Tesla Model S.
- **Ms. Liisa Koskela:** A pedestrian crossing the street at Kauhava Circle stated she was struck by debris from the collision, sustaining injuries requiring immediate medical attention.

### **Damage Descriptions**

1. **Tesla Model S:**  
   The vehicle sustained front-end damage with a noticeable dent on the left side. The battery pack remained functional but required additional charging due to the incident.
   
2. **Heavy-Duty Truck:**  
   The truck appeared unharmed, though minor dents were visible on its right front bumper.

3. **City Van:**  
   Significant front-end deformation was observed, with the vehicle unable to continue normal operations and requiring repair at a nearby workshop.

### **Conclusion**

The investigation revealed that the City Van's driver failed to stop in time due to reduced visibility from the wind, contributing to the collision. The Tesla Model S was traveling at the speed limit when it stopped at the red light, while the Heavy-Duty Truck maintained proper traffic laws.

**Recommendations:**  
- Enhanced pedestrian safety measures should be implemented near Kauhava Circle.
- Additional training on low-visibility driving conditions is recommended for all drivers involved in similar scenarios.
