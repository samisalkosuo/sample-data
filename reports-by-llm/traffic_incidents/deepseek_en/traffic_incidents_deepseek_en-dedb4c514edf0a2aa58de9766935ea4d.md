### Incident Summary

On the morning of 15 May 2025, a traffic collision occurred in Merikarvia involving two vehicles. The incident took place at an intersection near the town center, where morning rush hour traffic was already high. The weather conditions, which were wet and slippery, played a significant role in the accident.

### Weather and Road Conditions

The weather on the day of the incident was forecasted to be partly cloudy with light rain, resulting in wet and slippery road surfaces. This made it particularly challenging for drivers to maintain control, especially at intersections where stopping distances increased significantly.

### Timeline of Events

1. **7:30 AM:** Driver John Doe (age 42) was traveling north on Rautakirjankatu towards the town center when he encountered Maria Smith's vehicle (a small passenger car). Maria was driving east on Kivikartilta, a local road known for its narrow lanes.

2. **7:35 AM:** Maria Smith noticed unusual braking behavior from John Doe and attempted to pull into her side of the road but lost control due to the slippery surface, causing an immediate collision with the front of John Doe's vehicle.

3. **7:40 AM:** The impact ejected a passenger from Maria Smith's car, prompting nearby witness Mr. Kaj Kivinen (age 29) to call emergency services. Paramedics arrived within five minutes and assessed injuries, finding minor head injuries for Maria but no immediate life-threatening issues.

4. **7:50 AM:** Police officers, led by Inspector Sari Lehto (age 38), arrived at the scene. They conducted a thorough investigation, including an examination of both vehicles. John Doe was interviewed and provided a statement, while Maria's passenger, Anna Lehto (age 21), also participated in the interrogation.

5. **8:00 AM:** After reviewing evidence and witness statements, the police determined that John Doe had failed to yield his right-of-way at the intersection, contributing significantly to the accident. Further investigation revealed that John was driving under the influence of alcohol, which exacerbated his inability to control his vehicle.

6. **8:15 AM:** The case was forwarded to the Traffic Accident Investigation Unit for further analysis, including blood tests on John Doe and an assessment of the road's condition by a traffic engineer.

### Detailed Description of the Accident Scene

The collision occurred at an intersection bordered by Rautakirjankatu (a major arterial road) and Kivikartilta (a narrow local road). The wet and slippery surface made it difficult for drivers to maintain control, particularly noticeable during the sharp turn required to navigate the intersection.

John Doe's vehicle sustained moderate front-end damage, including a slightly damaged headlight. Maria Smith's car exhibited signs of impact on its left side, with minor dents visible upon exiting the scene.

### Analysis of the Crash

The investigation revealed that John Doe had been driving under the influence of alcohol, as evidenced by his blood alcohol level exceeding the legal limit. This negligence contributed directly to the collision and subsequent injuries sustained by Maria Smith's passenger.

The slippery road surface amplified the effects of John Doe's speeding and aggressive braking, leading to an unavoidable situation where he failed to yield his right-of-way at the intersection.

### Conclusion

This traffic incident highlights the dangers of driving under the influence in adverse weather conditions. The police are reminding drivers to exercise caution on wet and slippery roads and adhere to speed limits to avoid similar incidents in the future.
