At approximately 15:30 local time on Wednesday, June 24, 2023, a severe traffic incident occurred near the intersection of Kruunusillat Yhteisvalokuvut and Rautakallion Kulta in Saltvik. The collision involved seven vehicles, including two passenger cars, three small passenger vehicles, one light commercial vehicle, and one heavy truck. The incident was exacerbated by mixed weather conditionsâ€”misty rain combined with flurries of snow, reducing visibility to approximately 200 meters.

The scene was initially observed by Saltvik City Police and local residents. Eyewitness accounts described a chaotic intersection where drivers failed to yield or brake in time, leading to a catastrophic pile-up. Witnesses reported that the accident occurred within minutes after the onset of the weather conditions, with drivers struggling to maintain control of their vehicles amidst reduced visibility.

The collision resulted in significant damage to all involved vehicles. The two passenger cars sustained severe front-end injuries, with one vehicle completely crushed. The small passenger vehicles and light commercial vehicle were moderately damaged, while the heavy truck incurred extensive structural damage, requiring specialized repair. No casualties were reported at this time; however, several occupants of the affected vehicles were treated for minor injuries.

Eyewitnesses noted that the intersection was particularly dangerous due to its narrow lanes and high volume of traffic during peak hour. The incident is under investigation by the Traffic Accident Investigation Unit, which will examine the drivers' behavior, vehicle conditions, and weather impact on the scene.

Saltvik City Police have cordially invited the public to provide any additional information regarding this incident. Further updates will be provided as the investigation progresses.
