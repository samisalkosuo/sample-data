*Municipality: Kaskinen, Finland*

At approximately 1:45 AM local time, a traffic collision occurred on the intersection of *Linnanmaa Polkuehdentori* and *Kaskininkan Rintama* in Kaskinen. The incident involved two vehicles, resulting in injuries to the occupants.

The weather conditions at the time included a northwesterly wind with intermittent gusts, accompanied by low visibility due to light mist. This made driving challenging, particularly for night drivers who had difficulty maintaining their situational awareness.

The driver of the first vehicle, identified as **Tuomas Lehto** (42 years old), was traveling eastbound on *Linnanmaa Polkuehdentori* towards the intersection. His passenger, **Salla Kivinen** (38 years old), was seated in the front seat. The second driver, **Leena Repo** (35 years old), was a pedestrian crossing the road on *Kaskininkan Rintama*. She reported that she had been walking to catch her bus when she encountered the collision.

The pedestrian sustained injuries including a minor fracture of her left arm and a sprained ankle. The driver of the second vehicle, identified as **Mikko Nieminen** (28 years old), was traveling northbound on *Kaskininkan Rintama*. His passenger, **Anna-Petra Jokinen** (30 years old), was seated in the backseat. Both passengers were uninjured.

The collision occurred when the driver of the second vehicle lost control while attempting to navigate a sharp turn on *Linnanmaa Polkuehdentori*. The impact resulted in both vehicles being damaged beyond repair. The driver of the second vehicle was treated at the scene for injuries believed to be unrelated to the accident, including minor burns from what appeared to be gasoline residue.

The investigation revealed that the primary contributing factor to the collision was the combination of low visibility due to the mist and wind, as well as the driver's fatigue, which had been exacerbated by a night shift the previous evening. No alcohol or drugs were detected in either vehicle.

The scene was preserved for further analysis, including an evaluation of the road surface and any potential evidence of external forces, such as debris or flying objects. Authorities are collaborating with local emergency services to ensure public safety following the incident.

This report concludes that the collision was a preventable accident stemming from a combination of environmental conditions and driver fatigue. Efforts are underway to address the injuries sustained by the pedestrians and passengers involved.
