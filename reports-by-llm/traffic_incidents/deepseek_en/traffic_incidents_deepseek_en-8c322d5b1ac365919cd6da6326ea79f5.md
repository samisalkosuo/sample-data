At approximately 10:30 AM local time on February 9th, 2024, a traffic collision occurred in Marttila involving two vehicles. The incident took place on the outskirts of the municipality along the Kruunusillat road, near the Syrj√§lahti neighborhood.

Weather conditions at the time included light snowfall, which contributed to reduced visibility and slippery road surfaces. This made it particularly challenging for drivers to maintain control, especially as one vehicle lost traction during the collision.

The driver of a small passenger car, identified as Mr. Pertti Kivinen (age 45), was struck from behind by a larger truck operated by Mr. Salla Lehto (age 38). Both individuals were traveling in the same direction on a narrow single-lane road when the collision occurred.

The truck sustained moderate damage to its front-end, while the passenger car remained largely undamaged but showed signs of impact at the rear. No structural integrity issues were reported for either vehicle.

Mr. Kivinen was unhurt following the collision, but Mr. Lehto experienced minor injuries requiring first aid attention. He was transported to a nearby healthcare facility for evaluation and treatment.

Eyewitness accounts from residents on the scene described a sudden swerving motion by the truck just before impact, leading to the collision. Attempts to seek assistance were reported by both parties shortly after the event.

The investigation into the incident is ongoing, with a focus on assessing the condition of the vehicles and reviewing accident reconstruction data. Further details will be provided once all contributing factors are thoroughly analyzed.

**Summary:**  
A traffic collision involving two vehicles occurred in Marttila due to adverse weather conditions and operator error. The truck sustained minor damage, while the passenger car remained largely unaffected. Both drivers were unhurt but required medical attention for Mr. Lehto. Further investigation is recommended to determine the cause of the accident.
