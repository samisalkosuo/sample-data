### **Weather Conditions**
The incident occurred under mixed weather conditions, with light rain and intermittent snow. Visibility was reduced to approximately 50 meters due to the combination of wet roads and icy patches caused by the snowfall. The mist further complicated the scene, making it difficult for emergency services and first responders to assess the situation immediately.

### **Road Conditions**
The accident took place on the newly reconstructed section of Road 123 in Reisjärvi, a quiet residential area known for its scenic views of Lake Jämsä. The road was recently paved but had not been properly cleared, leaving it in a condition that combined wetness from rain and snow accumulation. This made the surface both slippery and uneven, contributing to the accident.
