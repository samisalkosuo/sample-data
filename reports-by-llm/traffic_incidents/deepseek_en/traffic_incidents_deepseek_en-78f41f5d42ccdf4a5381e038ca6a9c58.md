At approximately 19:30 local time, a two-vehicle collision occurred on the roadway leading to Rautakallio. The incident involved a passenger vehicle and a cargo truck. Both drivers were reported to be under the influence of alcohol at the scene.

The crash was described as severe, with one of the vehicles sustaining significant front-end damage, while the other suffered rear-end injuries. Emergency services arrived on-site within 30 minutes of the initial report, finding both occupants of the passenger vehicle injured and requiring immediate medical attention. The cargo truck driver was pronounced dead at the scene due to injuries sustained in the collision.

Weather conditions at the time included icy roads, which contributed significantly to the accident's severity. Visibility was severely reduced, making it difficult for drivers to perceive obstacles ahead. Both vehicles were traveling eastbound on Koski Tl's main arterial road when the collision occurred.

The passenger vehicle driver, identified as John Doe (age 42), was operating a four-door sedan registered under the fictitious plate number AL-7890.

Both drivers were reported to have been driving under the influence of alcohol, with blood tests confirming their intoxication levels.

The crash investigation revealed that the passenger vehicle had attempted to make a right-hand turn onto a narrow side street when it lost control and collided with the cargo truck. The truck was traveling at an elevated speed due to reduced visibility caused by the icy conditions, contributing to the accident's severity.

Forensic examinations conducted on scene revealed partial damage to both vehicles' bumpers and front grille areas. No significant injuries were reported for the passenger vehicle occupants aside from minor injuries sustained during the collision. The cargo truck driver was pronounced dead at the hospital following the incident.

The investigation concluded that John Doe was at fault due to his intoxication, while Maria Smith's death was attributed to unavoidable circumstances under the given conditions. Both parties have been referred to the relevant authorities for further legal proceedings.
