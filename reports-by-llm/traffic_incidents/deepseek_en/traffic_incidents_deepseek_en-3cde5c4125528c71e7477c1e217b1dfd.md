### **Weather and Road Conditions**

The incident occurred during a period of light rain, which had been ongoing since approximately 06:30 AM. The rain contributed to reduced visibility on the roads, making it difficult for drivers to anticipate obstacles. Additionally, the wet surface slightly decreased the coefficient of friction between the tyres and the road, exacerbating hydroplaning.
