### **Weather and Road Conditions**

The incident occurred during the morning rush hour, with temperatures in the low 5°C range. Heavy rain coupled with reduced visibility contributed to the slippery conditions on the road. The accumulation of rainwater had coated the asphalt, creating dangerous hydroplaning surfaces that affected drivers' ability to maintain control.

### **Scene Description**

The video footage confirmed that the collision occurred at an uncontrolled intersection where no traffic signals were present. The wet and slippery road conditions made it difficult for drivers to anticipate obstacles, contributing to the accident.

Local residents reported that the area had been experiencing rain for the past 30 minutes prior to the incident, exacerbating the slippery conditions on the asphalt.
