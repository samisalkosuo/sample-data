#### 2. **Arrival at the Scene:**  
The police arrived at the scene of the accident on a quiet residential area near the town's outskirts. The fog had been thick for several hours, making visibility extremely low. Witnesses described the scene as a "crash" involving three vehicles: a passenger car, a small truck, and another vehicle believed to be a van.  

#### 3. **Details from the Driver:**  
Tuomas Lehto stated that he was driving his 2019 Toyota Camry towards the community center when he lost control of the vehicle due to alcohol consumption. He claimed he had been at a bar for several hours and believed it was unsafe to drive home.  

#### 4. **Witness Statements:**  
A nearby resident, Olli Nieminen (age 32), corroborated the driver's account. He stated that he had seen the accident while walking his dog and described the scene as "chaotic" with heavy fog hindering visibility. Another witness, Martti Vuorinen (age 45), a local business owner, confirmed hearing a crash near his property but did not provide further details.
