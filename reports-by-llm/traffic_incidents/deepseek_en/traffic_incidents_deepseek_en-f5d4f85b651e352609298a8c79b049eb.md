**Incident Overview:**  
The collision took place near the village of Kivij√§rvi, approximately 15 kilometers west of Nivala's downtown area. The incident occurred after a vehicle driven by Mr. Antti Koski (age 48) failed to stop at a red light on Rautakirjalankatu, a well-known residential street in the municipality. The failure to stop led to an emergency brake activation, which caused the vehicle to collide with multiple stationary cars and a pedestrian.

**Weather Conditions:**  
The evening of the incident was marked by dry yet cold weather. A thin layer of frost covered the roads, reducing visibility significantly. Visibility dropped below 200 meters shortly after sunset, impacting drivers' ability to anticipate traffic ahead. The temperature remained below freezing throughout the night, exacerbating the slippery conditions.

**Road Conditions:**  
The road surface was in good condition prior to the incident but became treacherous due to reduced visibility and cold temperatures. Snowfall earlier that day had left patches of ice on the roads, although it remained dry by evening. The combination of low visibility and icy-like conditions made it difficult for drivers to maintain control, particularly at intersections.

**Witness Statements:**  
Eyewitnesses reported that the accident occurred around 21:45 local time. Mr. Koski, driving a silver Toyota Matrix, was visibly distressed upon impact. Witnesses noted that the vehicle swerved sharply to the right, colliding with several parked cars and a pedestrian who had been crossing the road. The pedestrian sustained injuries consistent with head injuries and a broken leg.

**Emergency Services Arrival:**  
At 21:50 local time, emergency services were dispatched to the scene following reports of a multi-vehicle collision involving ten vehicles.

**Vehicle Damage:**  
The damage assessment revealed significant front-end destruction across all involved vehicles. The Toyota Matrix sustained severe deformation to its left-front bumper and windshield. Other vehicles included a black Peugeot 308, a white Honda Civic, and several smaller passenger cars with various damages to their bumpers and windows.

**Conclusion:**  
The investigation concluded that the primary cause of the incident was Mr. Antti Koski's failure to stop at a red light, coupled with his inability to control his vehicle under the adverse weather conditions. The incident occurred during peak hour traffic in a heavily populated area, exacerbating the risk of collision.
