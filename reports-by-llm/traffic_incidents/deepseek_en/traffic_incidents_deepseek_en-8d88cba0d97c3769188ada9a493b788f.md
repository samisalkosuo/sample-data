At approximately 11:45 PM local time, a traffic incident occurred on the evening of October 22, 2023, in the area of Syrkanenkatu and Lehtipitkäntori. The scene involved two motor vehicles, resulting in minor injuries to both drivers.

The investigation revealed that the incident began at a stop sign located on Syrkanenkatu. Driver A, identified as John Doe (age 45), was traveling eastbound on Syrkanenkatu when his vehicle, registered as *Peugeot 208T 1.6 L Auto xDrive CO2*, collided with the rear of another vehicle. The second driver, identified as Alex Petrov (age 37), was traveling westbound on Lehtipitkäntori and had no prior intention to turn right at the stop sign.

Weather conditions during the incident included overcast skies with light mist, significantly reducing visibility. This made night driving challenging for both vehicles involved. Driver A failed to yield his right and proceeded into the intersection without properly stopping or signaling, leading to the collision.

The impact of the crash occurred near the corner of Syrkanenkatu and Lehtipitkäntori. Both drivers were able to exit their vehicles without significant injury. Driver A sustained minor injuries to his left temple due to a struck object, while Driver Petrov reported no visible injuries.

Witnesses on scene provided consistent accounts of the incident, describing the collision as sudden and forceful. The police assessment indicated that both drivers were under the influence of alcohol at the time of the accident. No further information was available regarding the cause of the collision beyond the alcohol-related factors.

The investigation concluded with both drivers being interviewed and their statements deemed admissible for the purposes of the case. No charges were filed, but the incident is reported as a precaution to prevent similar occurrences in the future.
