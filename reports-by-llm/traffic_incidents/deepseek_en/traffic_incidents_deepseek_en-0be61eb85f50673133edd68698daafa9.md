The scene was located at the intersection of Kruunusillat and Mustasarenkatu, a well-known residential area in Mustasaari. The collision occurred on a two-way road between two drivers, identified as Alex Johnson (male) and Maria Martinez (female), who were traveling in opposite directions.

**Witness Statements:**

- **Anna Thompson:** A resident of Mustasaari reported that she was walking along the sidewalk when she noticed both vehicles involved in the accident.

- **Tom Brown:** An eyewitness stated that he was driving on the same road and heard a sudden swerve from behind his vehicle. He confirmed that both drivers were wearing seatbelts but reported no immediate injuries upon impact.

**Road Conditions:**

The overcast weather conditions significantly impacted visibility, making it difficult for drivers to see approaching vehicles or pedestrians. The collision occurred shortly after 7 PM when traffic was already light due to the evening rush hour in Mustasaari.
