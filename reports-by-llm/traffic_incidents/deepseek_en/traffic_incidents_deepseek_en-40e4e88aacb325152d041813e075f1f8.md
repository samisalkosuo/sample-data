The incident occurred on the evening of December 19, 2022, in the municipality of Sastamala, Finland. A significant traffic collision involved eight vehicles, all traveling in a convoy from the area of Kruunusillat Yhteisvalokaverin (KSY) to the town center. The accident took place on a narrow, winding road leading into the downtown area.

The weather conditions were overcast, with low visibility due to mist and reduced daylight. This made it challenging for drivers to see approaching vehicles, particularly at night when the incident occurred. The evening commute was already strained, adding to the complexity of the situation.

The primary vehicle involved in the accident was a passenger bus carrying students from a local school. The driver, Mr. Antti Kivinen (age 42), reported that he had been driving for approximately two hours before the incident. According to his account, he lost concentration due to fatigue and failed to notice the vehicle ahead coming to a stop in time.

The collision occurred near the intersection of Sastamala Yhteisvalokaverin and Rautakartilinnan Kruunusillat Yhteisvalokaverin (RYKY) Road. The impact resulted in injuries, primarily among the passengers and crew of the bus. Mr. Kivinen sustained minor injuries from the collision but was not seriously injured.

Eyewitness accounts from two individuals corroborated the driver's report. One witness, Maria Lehto (age 28), a teacher traveling with her students, described seeing the vehicle ahead stop abruptly and failing to yield. Another witness, Mr. Pertti Nieminen (age 35), a local business owner, confirmed hearing a sudden jolt in his vehicle as he approached the collision site.

The scene was cleared by Finnish National Road Traffic Police Unit within approximately two hours of the incident occurring. The investigation revealed that the primary cause of the accident was the driver's fatigue and lack of attention to surroundings due to extended driving without rest intervals.

In conclusion, the traffic incident on December 19, 2022, in Sastamala, Finland, involved eight vehicles and resulted in minor injuries among passengers and crew. No serious injuries were reported, but the accident highlights the risks associated with long-distance driving under fatigue. The investigation is ongoing to determine if further legal action will be required.
