**Traffic Incident Report**

**Date:** 07.07.2023  
**Location:** Kyyjärvi, Finland  

**Weather Conditions:** Mixed snow and rain, with partly cloudy skies and light rain showers interspersed with flurries of snow. Visibility was reduced to around 200 meters due to the weather conditions.

At approximately 17:15 hours, a collision occurred at the intersection of Syrkiäri Street and Rautakirjankatu in Kyyjärvi. The incident involved two motor vehicles: a 2018 Toyota Camry (Vehicle ID A1B 9876) driven by Säätö Kauanen, whose passengers included Lehto Leino and Tuomas Mäkinen, and an unspecified vehicle (Vehicle ID C3D 8765). 

The driver of the Toyota Camry, Säätö Kauanen, was traveling eastbound on Syrkiäri Street when he attempted to turn right onto Rautakirjankatu. He failed to yield to a Ford Explorer (Vehicle ID B2E 4321) stopped at the intersection due to heavy snow and rain conditions. This resulted in a head-on collision, causing both vehicles to be damaged.

Eyewitness accounts from two individuals corroborated the incident: one witness noted the Camry's driver appeared to lose control shortly before impact, while another described the Ford Explorer as being stationary with visible front-end damage and crushed metal at the impact point.

The Toyota Camry sustained moderate damage to its front bumper and side impact, along with a shattered windscreen. The Ford Explorer experienced front-end deformation, broken window玻璃, and scattered debris from the collision.

No injuries were reported among the occupants of either vehicle. Police officers are currently assessing the scene for further evidence and will conduct interviews with all parties involved.

This incident is under investigation to determine the exact cause, which may include alcohol or substance use, as it remains a possibility given the circumstances surrounding the collision.

**Conclusion:**  
The collision at the intersection on 07.07.2023 resulted in minor damages to both vehicles and no reported injuries. Further details will be provided by the police investigation team once all evidence is collected.
