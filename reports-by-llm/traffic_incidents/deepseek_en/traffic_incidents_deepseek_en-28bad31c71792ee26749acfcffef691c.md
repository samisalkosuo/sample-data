Weather conditions played a significant role in the incident. The dry but cold weather caused reduced visibility and made it difficult for drivers to perceive their surroundings accurately. This contributed to the sudden stop by vehicle B, which was traveling at a higher speed than the speed limit for the area.

Witnesses reported that the incident occurred during peak morning traffic, with high vehicle speeds in the area. The investigation into the cause of the collision is ongoing, focusing on the sudden stop by vehicle B and whether it was an accident or intentional act.
