**Participants Involved:**

- **Driver C (Mr. Jonas Wallin):** A 29-year-old male driver who was operating a small van (Model: Ford Transit Connect). He was traveling on a residential street near the accident scene at the time of the incident.

**Vehicles Involved:**  
1. **Passenger Car:** Model: Volvo C30, registration number FJX-56789. The vehicle sustained significant damage to its front bumper and side impact area due to the collision.  
2. **Heavy-Duty Truck:** Model: Freightliner Cascadia, registration number SKY-12345. The truck remained undamaged but reported that it had stopped at a construction site just moments before the accident.  
3. **Small Van:** Model: Ford Transit Connect, registration number MMM-98765. The van was traveling on a residential street and reported no injuries or damage.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**  
The incident occurred under overcast conditions with light rain, which made visibility extremely low. The rain reduced driving conditions significantly, contributing to the accident. The road surface was wet due to the recent rain, increasing the risk of hydroplaning and skidding.

**Timeline of Events:**  
1. **Approach to the Collision Site:** Driver A was traveling on Korsnäs Road at a moderate speed when he approached a stop sign near a local business district. He reported that he had just left work in Korsnäs earlier that day.  
2. **Stopping for Traffic:** Driver B, operating the heavy-duty truck, stopped at the same stop sign as Driver A but did not encounter any issues and continued driving towards the town center.  
3. **Driver C's Incident:** Driver C was traveling on a residential street just before the collision site when he lost concentration due to fatigue. He reported that he had been working late and was tired, which may have contributed to his distraction.  
4. **Collision Occurred:** Driver C lost control of the van while trying to make a sharp left turn onto Korsnäs Road. The vehicle skidded into the back of the passenger car (Driver A's vehicle) due to the low visibility and wet conditions, causing both vehicles to come to rest in a damaged state near the stop sign.  
5. **Emergency Response:** The accident was reported immediately to the local police station, which coordinated with fire and rescue teams to assess the scene. Driver C was unhurt but reported that he had minor injuries from the collision.

**Observations:**  
The investigation into the incident revealed several factors contributing to the accident:  
- Driver A's adherence to speed limits under overcast conditions could have been improved by reflective devices or better visibility.  
- Driver B's decision to stop at the stop sign was appropriate, but she reported that she had not encountered any issues with traffic after stopping.  
- Driver C's fatigue and distraction were significant factors in the incident.  

**Conclusion:**  
The collision occurred due to a combination of low visibility caused by overcast weather and wet road conditions, as well as driver fatigue and distraction. The police investigation is ongoing to determine if any charges will be brought against the drivers involved.
