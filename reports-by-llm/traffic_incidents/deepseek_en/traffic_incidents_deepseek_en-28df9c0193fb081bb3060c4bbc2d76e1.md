At approximately 10:45 AM local time on August 5th, 2023, the Lappeenranta Police Department received a report of a multi-vehicle accident involving six vehicles at the intersection of Kruunusillat Yhteisvalokuvut and Rautakallion Kulta. The incident was exacerbated by foggy weather conditions, which significantly reduced visibility and contributed to the accident's severity.

The driver of a 2019 Toyota Saloon, identified as Mr. Pertti Kivipelto, reported that he had stopped at the scene after being struck from behind by an 18-wheel construction crane trailer. Witnesses on the scene described seeing multiple vehicles involved in the collision, with one witness noting damage to the front bumpers and a suspected injuries to a pedestrian nearby.

Upon arrival at the scene, officers found six vehicles:  
1. A 2020 Ford Crossover (Driver: Ms. Anna Lehtim√§ki) struck by an 18-wheel construction crane trailer.  
2. An 2019 Toyota Saloon (Driver: Mr. Pertti Kivipelto), struck from behind and partially engulfed in flames.  
3. A 2021 Suzuki SX4 (Driver: Mr. Ville Vuorinen) involved in a minor collision with another vehicle.  
4. An 2018 Honda Civic (Driver: Ms. Salla-Paola Kivimaa) sustaining light front bumper damage.  
5. A 2023 Toyota Van (Driver: Mr. Pertti Nieminen) with no reported injuries but showing signs of impact on the side.  
6. An 2022 Yamaha MT-125 Motorcycle (Driver: Ms. Riina-Petra Jokinen) struck by a vehicle from the opposite direction.

Weather conditions at the time included light to moderate fog, reducing visibility to approximately quarter mile. The roads were also wet due to recent rain, adding to the slippery conditions. Authorities are investigating whether the accident was an accident or an intentional act, with no immediate evidence pointing towards criminal behavior.

The investigation revealed that the 18-wheel construction crane trailer had been parked near the intersection and had not moved prior to the accident. Further details on the cause of the accident will be determined during the subsequent investigation phase.

This report concludes with the information gathered at the scene, and further updates will be provided as the investigation progresses.
