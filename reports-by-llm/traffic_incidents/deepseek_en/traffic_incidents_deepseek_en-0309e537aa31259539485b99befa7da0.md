*Date: 21.03.2023*  
*Municipality: Loimaa, Finland*  

At approximately 07:30 local time on March 21, 2023, a traffic incident occurred involving three vehicles in the municipality of Loimaa, Finland. The incident took place on the outskirts of the town, near the intersection of Kumpula Street and Syrjoki Lane, under snowy weather conditions that made visibility challenging for drivers.

Weather Conditions:  
The area experienced light snowfall at the time of the incident, with accumulations of less than 2 centimeters. Snow-covered surfaces reduced driving visibility significantly, leading to slower speeds and increased reliance on alternative routes by local residents. The presence of snow also contributed to reduced traction on the roads, increasing the risk of hydroplaning or skidding for vehicles equipped with winter tires.

Road Conditions:  
The road network surrounding the incident was in good condition overall, but the accumulation of snow on curbs, sidewalks, and minor cracks posed challenges for pedestrians and cyclists. Power lines were also downed in the area, adding to the hazardous conditions for drivers navigating the scene.

**Timeline of Events:**  

1. **Morning Traffic Conditions:**  
   The morning commute in Loimaa was already starting to experience moderate traffic congestion due to the approaching winter solstice and reduced daylight hours. Snow-covered roads discouraged driving, leading to slower-moving vehicles and an increase in pedestrian activity as residents sought shelter indoors.

2. **Driver A's Incident:**  
   At approximately 07:35 local time, Driver A (a 42-year-old male) was observed pulling out of a convenience store located on Kumpula Street when the vehicle lost control due to reduced traction caused by the snow. The impact occurred at the intersection with Syrjoki Lane, where another vehicle owned by Driver B (a 38-year-old female) had already come to a stop.

3. **Collision and Impact:**  
   The collision resulted in both vehicles sustaining moderate front-end damage. A third vehicle, operated by Driver C (a 29-year-old male), was also involved in the incident following the initial crash. Driver C's vehicle appeared to be struck from behind by one of the initially damaged vehicles before the impact with Driver B's vehicle occurred.

4. **Emergency Services Arrival:**  
   At approximately 07:45 local time, emergency services, including the local police and fire department, arrived at the scene. The area was relatively quiet post-incident, as most residents had already returned home or were on their way to work in the morning rush.

5. **Witness Statements:**  
   A witness reported that they were unable to provide a clear account of what had happened due to the snowy conditions and reduced visibility. However, they described seeing multiple vehicles involved in the collision and stated that they themselves were not injured but had been struck by debris from one of the vehicles as it moved forward after the initial crash.

6. **Aftermath:**  
   The incident resulted in minor injuries reported by Driver B, who sustained a cut on their left hand due to the impact with Driver C's vehicle. Both drivers A and C were unhurt but had minor injuries consistent with the collision forces. The third vehicle, operated by Driver C, was towed away from the scene for further inspection.
