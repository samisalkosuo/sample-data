At approximately 23:15, a silver Toyota Yaris (Vehicle A) was traveling on the outskirts of Taivalkoski towards the town center. The driver, Mr. Saku Kivinen, lost control due to the slippery wet roads, skidding onto the shoulder. This incident led to an accident involving three vehicles.

 moments later, a dark blue Volvo S90 (Vehicle B) entered the scene on a nearby street, also affected by the poor weather conditions. The driver, Mr. Pertti Lehto, attempted to navigate the slippery surface but failed to maintain control, causing a collision with Vehicle A.
