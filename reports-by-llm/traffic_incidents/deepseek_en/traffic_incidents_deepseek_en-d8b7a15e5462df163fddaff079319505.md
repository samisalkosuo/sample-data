At approximately 1:30 AM local time, a traffic incident occurred near the intersection of Kruunusillat Street and Rautakirjenvihti Avenue in Masku. The collision involved two vehicles, resulting in injuries to the occupants.

**Narrative:**  
The driver of a medium-sized passenger car, identified as Tuomas Kivimaa (age 42), was traveling northbound on Kruunusillat Street when his vehicle lost control due to overloading and hydroplaning. The impact occurred at the intersection with Rautakirjenvihti Avenue, where another vehicle, a smaller passenger car driven by Leena Soininen (age 38), failed to yield to the oncoming traffic.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**  
The incident took place under clear and sunny conditions, yet the combination of midnight sun and cooler temperatures contributed to reduced visibility. The road surface was dry, but the wet snow tires on the involved vehicles exacerbated traction issues.

**Vehicle Models and Damage:**  
- **Toyota Camry (Model: 2023 SE L2, VIN: A1B-MN9876)**: Severe damage to the front bumper, bent left-front beam, and shattered side windows. The driver sustained injuries requiring immediate medical attention.
- **Honda Civic (Model: 2022 EX-L, VIN: C3D-FG5678)**: Front-end deformation with a missing grille and bumper. The passenger, Anna Lindstr√∂m (age 29), was unhurt.

**Witness Account:**  
Eyewitnesses reported both vehicles were evident at the scene, with the Camry appearing to have driven off while the Civic remained stationary. Witnesses also noted that Leena Soininen failed to stop before the collision and did not attempt to yield to Tuomas Kivimaa's vehicle.

**Conclusion:**  
The incident was resolved without significant property damage beyond repair costs. Both drivers were interviewed by the police, and medical examinations were conducted. The investigation is ongoing to determine fault and liability.
