At approximately 18:30 local time on the evening of April 9th, 2024, a traffic collision occurred near the intersection of Kruunusillat Yhteisrue and Syvystä Rues in Kankaanpää. The incident involved two vehicles, resulting in injuries to both drivers and passengers.

The scene was located approximately 500 meters west-northwest of Kauhaluoneen Rues, a well-known residential area near the town's outskirts. Emergency services, including the Kankaanpää Police Station, arrived at the scene within minutes after receiving a report from witness(es) who had observed the collision while traveling on Syvystä Rues.

The weather conditions at the time included mixed snow and rain, which significantly impacted road visibility. Drivers reported difficulty maintaining control of their vehicles due to hydroplaning in wet patches and reduced traction caused by the icy and frosted surfaces. The accident occurred during a period of light traffic, with minimal oncoming traffic but heavy vehicle presence in the area.

The primary vehicle involved was a small private passenger car (Toyota Yaris) traveling eastbound on Syvystä Rues, driven by Mr. Saku Nieminen (42 years old). The secondary vehicle was a medium-sized truck (Mitsubishi Canter) traveling westbound on Kruunusillat Yhteisrue, operated by Ms. Liisa Kivipelto (38 years old).

The collision occurred in a head-on fashion near the intersection, with both vehicles coming to rest shortly after impact. The Toyota Yaris sustained moderate front-end damage, including a shattered windscreen and bent front bumper, while the Mitsubishi Canter experienced rear-wheel damage with hydroplaning occurring on its rear axle.

Mr. Nieminen was pronounced dead at the scene due to injuries sustained during the collision. He was transported to Kankaanpää University Hospital for treatment but later succumbed to his injuries. Ms. Kivipelto, who was driving a passenger vehicle (Volkswagen Passat), suffered minor injuries including a broken collarbone and lacerations on her forehead from the impact.

Witnesses reported that both drivers appeared intoxicated at the time of the collision. Blood tests conducted shortly after the incident confirmed that Mr. Nieminen had a blood alcohol level exceeding the legal limit, while Ms. Kivipelto was sober but chose not to seek medical treatment following the event.

The crash investigators concluded that the primary contributing factor to the accident was the intoxication of Mr. Nieminen and insufficient driver's license insurance coverage for his vehicle. The secondary vehicle operator, Ms. Kivipelto, was deemed at least partially responsible due to her decision to drive under the influence despite being sober.

The scene remained stabilized following the arrival of emergency services and paramedics. No further collisions or injuries were reported during the incident. Police officers conducted a thorough investigation into the scene, including examination of both vehicles' damage, witness statements, and evidence collected at the site.

Following the investigation, no criminal charges were expected to be filed against Ms. Kivipelto due to insufficient evidence linking her to the intoxication of Mr. Nieminen. However, the case was referred to the Road Traffic Collision Investigation Unit for further analysis into the contributing factors of the accident.

The incident is under review by the local police force to assess any potential legal implications and to ensure compliance with road safety regulations in future traffic incidents. The investigation concluded at approximately 23:15 local time on April 9th, 2024.
