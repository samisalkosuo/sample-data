### Weather and Road Conditions

The incident occurred under challenging weather conditions: a strong north wind with gusts reaching speeds of up to 50 km/h. The visibility was reduced to less than 200 meters, making night travel particularly dangerous. Additionally, the road had been left unattended for several hours due to heavy snowfall and strong winds, contributing to the accident.

### Timeline

1. **19:30 Hours:** A construction company truck (Model: "T-Drive 750") traveling from Kuhmo to Suomussalmi was involved in a collision with an oncoming private passenger vehicle (Model: "Toyota Camry"). The driver, Mr. Teuvo Lehto, sustained severe injuries and was pronounced dead at the scene.

2. **19:45 Hours:** A small car (Model: "Honda Civic") driven by Ms. Salla-Paola Vuorinen lost control on a sharp curve due to reduced visibility caused by strong winds. The vehicle collided with another private passenger vehicle (Model: "Nissan Altima") in front of her.

3. **20:15 Hours:** A medium-sized truck (Model: "Dually 9000") driven by Mr. Pertti Nieminen was struck from the rear by a heavy-duty transport truck (Model: " Freightliner 86"). The collision occurred while both vehicles were traveling in opposite directions on a narrow, winding road.

4. **20:30 Hours:** A private passenger vehicle (Model: "Hyundai i30") driven by Ms. Anna Kivim채ki lost control and collided with another small car (Model: "Skoda Fabia"). The impact was severe enough to damage both vehicles beyond repair.

### Weather Conditions

The strong north wind with gusts of up to 50 km/h caused severe reductions in visibility, making it nearly impossible for drivers to see oncoming traffic. Additionally, the accumulation of snow on the road surfaces made traction difficult to maintain, further contributing to the accident.

### Conclusion

The incident on February 1st, 2025, involved a complex series of events that led to a catastrophic collision involving seven vehicles. The strong north wind with gusts caused severe reductions in visibility and traction issues, making it nearly impossible for drivers to navigate the winding road safely. The accident resulted in significant damage to all involved vehicles and injuries to several individuals, including Mr. Teuvo Lehto, who was pronounced dead at the scene.

The investigation is ongoing, but preliminary findings suggest that driver fatigue due to long hours on the road may have contributed to some of the incidents. Authorities are working to clear the scene and assist with recovery operations while ensuring public safety remains a priority in future incidents.
