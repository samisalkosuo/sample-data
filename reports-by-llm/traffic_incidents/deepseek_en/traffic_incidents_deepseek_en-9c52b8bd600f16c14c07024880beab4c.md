### **Timeline of Events**

1. **Collision Occurred at 7:30 PM**  
   At approximately 7:25 PM, driver A (male, age 48) was traveling eastbound on Kylälahti Street when their vehicle failed to stop at a red light at the intersection with Säiläinen Street. This failure caused driver B's (female, age 34) vehicle to veer off the road and collide with driver A's vehicle.

2. **Weather Conditions**  
   The incident occurred under dry but cold weather conditions, which reduced visibility and made reaction times slower for both drivers. Driver A had been driving for approximately 10 hours before the collision and reported fatigue as a contributing factor.

   - Both vehicles were towed away from the collision site after fire department inspections confirmed no structural damage beyond minor dents and scratches.

### **Accident Analysis**

The collision appeared to be a head-on accident between two passenger vehicles. Driver A's vehicle was traveling eastbound on Kylälahti Street when it failed to stop at the red light at Säiläinen Street. Driver B had been traveling northbound on Säilänen Drive and lost control due to reduced visibility caused by the combination of cold weather and residual mist.

Both drivers were wearing seatbelts at the time of collision, and no alcohol or drugs were detected in either driver's system.
