**Narrative of the Incident:**

On the evening of December 23, 2023, at approximately 17:45 hours, a traffic collision occurred in the area of Säilinlahti on Rautakirjankatu. The incident involved four vehicles, including two passenger cars, one small passenger vehicle, and a light-duty truck. The driver of one of the passenger cars, John Doe from Helsinki, was reported to be seriously injured with injuries to his left arm and shoulder.

The collision occurred when Doe attempted to pass another vehicle traveling in the opposite direction on Rautakirjankatu. Doe lost control of his vehicle due to strong winds that were blowing from the north at speeds exceeding 40 km/h, which had caused reduced visibility and traction on the wet pavements. The impact resulted in both vehicles being damaged beyond repair.

Passengers onboard, including Emma Lindström (28), a businesswoman from Stockholm, sustained minor injuries such as bruises and cuts. Witnesses reported that the scene was initially obscured by thick fog created by the strong winds, making it difficult for drivers to see each other until the accident occurred.

The wind direction was from the north-northwest, contributing significantly to the reduced visibility on the road.
