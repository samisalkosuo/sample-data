### **Weather and Road Conditions**

The evening of the 18th of May 2024 was marked by windy conditions with gusts reaching speeds of up to 35 km/h. Visibility was severely reduced, making it difficult for drivers to maintain control of their vehicles. The combination of low visibility and high winds created hazardous road conditions, particularly on narrow lanes and steep hills.

A small tree near the collision site had been uprooted by strong winds earlier in the evening, adding to the risk of debris impacting the road. This further complicated emergency response efforts.
