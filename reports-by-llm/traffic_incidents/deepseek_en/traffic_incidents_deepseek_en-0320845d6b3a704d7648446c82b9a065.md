At approximately 18:30 hours on the evening of Monday, 10 May 2023, a traffic collision occurred near the intersection of Rautakylä Street and Yrjönhentori Lane in Savitaipale. The incident involved two passenger vehicles, resulting in injuries to both drivers and passengers.

The weather conditions at the time included heavy rain, which significantly reduced visibility and impacted road conditions. This contributed to the challenging driving environment that led to the accident.

**Event Sequence:**

1. **Approach to Collision:**  
   Driver A (John Doe) was traveling on Rautakylä Street towards Yrjönhentori Lane when his vehicle, a 2018 Toyota Camry, entered the intersection. The vehicle appeared to lose control and skidded across the wet surface.

2. **Collision at Intersection:**  
   The impact occurred shortly after the skid, with both vehicles colliding head-on. Driver B (Maria Smith) of the second vehicle, a 2019 Honda Civic, sustained injuries following the collision.

3. **Weather Impact:**  
   The heavy rain caused hydrodynamic damage to both vehicles, creating distinct hydrodynamic footprints at the scene. The reduced visibility made it difficult for drivers to perceive obstacles in time.

**Witness Statement:**

Olli Kivinen (witness) reported that he was traveling on Yrjönhentori Lane when he observed the accident approximately 50 meters from the intersection. He noted that both vehicles were hydrodynamic and had left wet skid marks leading up to the collision site. The witness also mentioned that visibility was severely reduced due to heavy rain.

**Conclusion:**

The investigation revealed that Driver A (John Doe) failed to yield right-of-way at the intersection, contributing to the accident. Both drivers exhibited disregard for traffic rules under adverse weather conditions. The injuries sustained by both parties were deemed minor and expected to recover fully with appropriate medical treatment.

The incident is under investigation by the Accident Investigation Team, which will continue to monitor the case and ensure a thorough review of all factors involved.

**Preventive Measures:**  
The police department has been advised to enhance public awareness in Savitaipale during heavy rain conditions. Additionally, the municipality is encouraged to consider additional safety measures at intersections with limited visibility.
