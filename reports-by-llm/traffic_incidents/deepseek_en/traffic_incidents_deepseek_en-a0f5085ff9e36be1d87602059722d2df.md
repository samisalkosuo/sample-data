The precipitation also contributed to hydroplaning, particularly affecting vehicles equipped with all-wheel drive systems.

### **Event Timeline**

2. **Incident Occurrence:** Mr. Kivinen lost control of his vehicle while exiting a sharp bend in Mustasillat. The Camry skidded into the parking area adjacent to a residential development, damaging its undercarriage and front bumper.

3. **Collision with Another Vehicle:** Unbeknownst to Mr. Kivinen at the time, driver Ms. Riina Jokinen (age 38) was traveling in the opposite direction on Laksonkatu when her vehicle, a 2019 Honda Civic, also experienced hydroplaning and entered the same parking area.

### **Analysis of Circumstances**

The heavy rain on February 3, 2024, played a critical role in the incident. The weather conditions reduced visibility and hindered drivers' ability to perceive their surroundings clearly, leading to hydroplaning and loss of control. Both vehicles were equipped with all-wheel drive systems, exacerbating the risk of hydroplaning under such conditions.

### **Conclusion**

The traffic incident on February 3, 2024, in Sipoo, Finland, was a result of adverse weather conditions combined with driver error during hydroplaning. Both drivers were unhurt apart from minor injuries sustained during the collision. Authorities are recommending increased vigilance during heavy rain periods to prevent such incidents.
