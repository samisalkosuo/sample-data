### **Narrative**  

On 8 December 2024, a pedestrian crossing Syrjänlahti Street was struck by the silver Toyota Camry, which had failed to yield and abruptly swerved onto the shoulder due to reduced visibility from mixed snow and rain. The collision sent the pedestrian into the street, where they were struck by oncoming traffic within seconds of impact.

The pedestrian, a 32-year-old woman from Helsinki, was transported to a local hospital for treatment of injuries sustained during the accident. Her condition has been stabilized, but she remains under investigation regarding the severity and cause of her injuries.

Following the pedestrian's collision, other vehicles in the vicinity began to lose control due to hydroplaning and skidding. A black Honda Civic, driven by a 45-year-old man from Porvoo, flipped onto its side near a downed tree on Syrjänlahti Street. The impact caused significant damage to the vehicle's left front axle and interior.

A white Ford Transit van, driven by a 28-year-old man from Helsinki, also sustained moderate damage following the collision with the pedestrian. The driver reported that they were not driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs at the time of the incident.

The accident occurred during peak hour traffic in Mynämäki's downtown area, where numerous small businesses and residential buildings are located. The combination of mixed weather conditions and high vehicle density created an environment conducive to the rapid onset of dangerous driving behaviors, such as sudden swerving and hydroplaning.

Witnesses are being asked to come forward if they have additional information regarding the accident. Police and accident investigators will continue to work closely with local authorities to ensure a thorough and transparent investigation into this traffic collision.
