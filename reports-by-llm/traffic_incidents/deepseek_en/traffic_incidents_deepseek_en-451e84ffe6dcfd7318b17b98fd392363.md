At approximately 06:35 local time, a traffic incident occurred on the roads of Kärsämäki. The scene was located at the intersection of Rautakyläntori and Säiläntori, a quiet residential area known for its peaceful streets.

The incident involved three vehicles:  
1. A small passenger car (Toyota Yaris) with a partially fractured left arm due to an accident during the morning commute.

3. A bicycle that was struck by debris from the van, sustaining minor injuries including a broken leg.

Weather conditions at the time included icy roads, which significantly reduced visibility and made it challenging for drivers to perceive obstacles in their path. Witnesses reported hearing multiple impacts along the road before noticing smoke originating from one of the vehicles near a parked car on Karkkaining Credits street.

The incident was resolved without major disruption to traffic after paramedics and police conducted thorough rescue operations on all involved parties, including securing the area and stabilizing the vehicles.

**Conclusion:**  
A traffic incident involving three vehicles occurred early morning hours in Kärsämäki due to a disturbance on icy roads. The injured parties were treated at the scene without serious harm. Further investigation is ongoing to determine the cause of the accident.
