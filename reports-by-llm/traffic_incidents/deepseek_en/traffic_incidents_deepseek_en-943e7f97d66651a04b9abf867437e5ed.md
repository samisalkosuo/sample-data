### Timeline of Events:

At approximately 18:30 hours on the evening of 08.04.2023, Driver A was traveling on Road 56 in Taipalsaari when they noticed something unusual happening to their vehicle. The car began to slow down unexpectedly while passing a narrow section of Road 56 that recently underwent roadwork due to an underground utility installation.

Driver A attempted to accelerate but failed to gain sufficient traction, causing the vehicle to lose control and roll onto its side. The impact resulted in a head-on collision with another vehicle traveling in the opposite direction on the same road.

The second vehicle, operated by Driver B, was also involved in the crash. Both drivers were uninjured at the time of the accident but reported minor injuries while securing their vehicles after the impact.

### Weather and Road Conditions:

The incident occurred under clear and sunny weather conditions with partly cloudy skies in the background. The road surface was dry due to recent rain, which had fallen earlier that day. However, the narrow section where the collision took place was slightly uneven, contributing to the accident.

### Damage Description:

- **Vehicle A (Toyota Camry):** Front-end damage consistent with a pothole impact.  
- **Vehicle B (Suzuki Cappuccino):** Rear-wheel skidmarks indicating loss of control during the collision.  

### Narrative:

At approximately 18:30 hours on 08.04.2023, Mr. Tuomas Lehto (Driver A) was traveling on Road 56 in Taipalsaari when they noticed their Toyota Camry had begun to slow down unexpectedly. The driver attempted to accelerate but failed to gain sufficient traction due to the recent roadwork and narrow road width. This resulted in the vehicle losing control and rolling onto its side.

The impact caused a head-on collision with another vehicle traveling in the opposite direction on Road 56, operated by Mr. Leena Rautio (Driver B) in his Suzuki Cappuccino. Both drivers were uninjured at the time of the accident but reported minor injuries while securing their vehicles after the impact.

### Conclusion:

The incident occurred due to a combination of road conditions and driver behavior. Driver A failed to anticipate the uneven road surface caused by recent roadwork, leading to an inability to gain sufficient traction and control during a sudden deceleration. The collision resulted in both vehicles sustaining damage consistent with the accident circumstances.
