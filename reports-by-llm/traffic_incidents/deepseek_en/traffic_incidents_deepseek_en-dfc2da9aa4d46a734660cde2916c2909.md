### **Weather and Road Conditions:**

The morning commute was already beginning to experience significant delays due to overcast weather conditions, which had turned the roads into a frosted glass-like surface. Visibility was severely reduced, making it difficult for drivers to see approaching vehicles or obstacles ahead. The mist further complicated situational awareness, as it obscured both the driver’s and oncoming passengers’ fields of vision.
