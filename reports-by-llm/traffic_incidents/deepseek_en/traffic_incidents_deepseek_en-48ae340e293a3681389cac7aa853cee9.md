At approximately 15:30 local time, an incident involving two vehicles occurred on the road network in Hailuoto. The scene was located at the intersection of Kruunusillat and Syrjälahti streets.

Weather conditions at the time included dry but cold temperatures, which significantly impacted visibility and braking performance. This contributed to the driver's sudden stop and subsequent accident.

The primary vehicle involved was a small passenger car (Model: 2019 Ford Focus) traveling northbound on Kruunusillat Street. The driver, identified as **Mr. Saku Nieminen** (age 45), reported that he had stopped abruptly due to an unexpected obstacle ahead. However, his sudden braking action caused the vehicle to lose control.

The second vehicle involved was a larger SUV (Model: 2018 Toyota Highlander) traveling eastbound on Syrjälahti Street. The driver, identified as **Ms. Liisa Kivinen** (age 38), attempted to swerve right to avoid the obstacle but lost traction due to reduced grip from the cold weather. The SUV skidded off the road and struck a tree located at the intersection.

Both drivers sustained injuries during the incident. Mr. Nieminen suffered minor injuries to his arm, while Ms. Kivinen had a contusion on her left hand. Both were treated by emergency services and released shortly after.

Witnesses reported that the scene was initially obscured by thick fog due to the cold weather, making it difficult for drivers to anticipate obstacles. Emergency services arrived within 15 minutes of the incident report and conducted preliminary assessments at the scene.

The investigation is ongoing, with further evaluation of both vehicles' damage and witness statements expected to conclude within the next 24 hours.
