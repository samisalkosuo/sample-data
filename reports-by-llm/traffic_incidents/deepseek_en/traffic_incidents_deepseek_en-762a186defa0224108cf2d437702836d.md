### **Incident Timeline**

1. **1:30 AM:** Driver John Doe (age 42) arrived at his workplace in Taivassalo and drove home via Rautakylä Icy Road, which was already beginning to freeze.
   
2. **2:00 AM:** John reported experiencing difficulty maintaining control of his 2015 Toyota Camry as he approached the city limits. The icy surface made it hard for him to slow down gradually.

3. **2:15 AM:** After stopping at a nearby gas station, John noticed his vehicle skidding uncontrollably on the ice. He attempted to regain control but failed, leading him to pull over onto the shoulder of the road.

4. **2:30 AM:** While waiting for help, John observed another vehicle, driven by Jane Smith (age 38), traveling in the opposite direction. The icy conditions made it difficult for Jane to stop, and her vehicle appeared to be losing control as well.

5. **2:45 AM:** John lost sight of Jane's vehicle and continued driving on Rautakylä Icy Road until he reached a closed gas station. He reported that his Camry had sustained front bumper dents and tire wear due to the sudden skid.

6. **3:00 AM:** John began moving towards Taivassalo when he noticed Jane's vehicle ahead, which had also lost control. The two vehicles collided head-on, with both drivers sustaining injuries.

7. **3:15 AM:** Both vehicles came to a halt in the parking lot of a nearby convenience store, where emergency services and police arrived within 10 minutes.
