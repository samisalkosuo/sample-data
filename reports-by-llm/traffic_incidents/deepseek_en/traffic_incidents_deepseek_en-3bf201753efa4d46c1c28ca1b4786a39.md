At approximately 15:30 local time, a traffic incident occurred on the intersection of Kruunusillat and Rautakallio in Miehikkälä, Finland. The collision involved two vehicles, resulting in minor injuries to the occupants.

The primary vehicle involved was a compact car, identified as *Volkswagen Microbus 12V* ( license plate: FI-987654321). The driver, Mr. Pertti Kivipelto, was traveling northbound on Rautakallio Road towards the intersection. The passenger, Ms. Anna Lehtimäki, was seated in the front seat.

The second vehicle involved was a medium-duty truck, identified as *Tavaro 750 TDW* (license plate: FI-654321987). The driver, Mr. Juhani Kivinen, was traveling eastbound on Kruunusillat Road towards the intersection. The passenger, Ms. Salla-Paola Vuorinen, was seated in the front seat.

Weather conditions at the time included overcast skies with intermittent fog, which significantly reduced visibility and contributed to the accident. The fog made it challenging for drivers to maintain proper following distances and judge their surroundings accurately.

The collision occurred when Mr. Kivipelto failed to yield right-of-way to Mr. Kivinen at the intersection. As a result of the impact, the car sustained damage to its left side mirror and front bumper. The truck suffered front-end damage from contact with the car's bumper.

Eyewitness accounts from nearby residents indicated that the accident occurred during heavy fog, which made it difficult for drivers to see each other until they were already in motion. No significant injuries were reported, but both vehicles required minor repairs.

This incident highlights the importance of adhering to traffic rules and maintaining awareness, especially in adverse weather conditions.
