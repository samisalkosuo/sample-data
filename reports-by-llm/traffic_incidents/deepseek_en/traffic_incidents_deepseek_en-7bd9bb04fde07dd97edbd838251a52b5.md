### **Weather and Road Conditions**

The incident occurred under light rain conditions, which significantly impacted visibility and road traction. The rain reduced drivers' ability to see ahead, contributing to the late collision time. The roads in the area were already wet from previous rain events, exacerbating the risk of hydroplaning or skidding.

### **Vehicle Damage**

1. **Vehicle 1:** A 2023 Toyota Camry ( license plate: TOY-LM-789) sustained moderate front-end damage consistent with a head-on collision. The vehicle was locked at impact, and the front grille was partially demolished.

2. **Vehicle 2:** A 2021 Ford Transit Van ( license plate: FOD-VN-456) suffered significant front-end deformation. The driver-side door was completely ripped off, and the bumper was severely crushed.

### **Witness Statements**

**Witness 1:**  
"I was driving on Rautakallio Yrityskaavio when I heard a sudden swerving sound to my left. I looked over and saw both cars coming towards me at a high speed. The rain made it impossible to see anything, so I lost control of the Camry almost immediately."

**Witness 2:**  
"I was traveling on Kruunusillat Yrityskaavio when I heard a loud crash behind me. I turned around and saw both vehicles collide head-on in the middle of the road. The rain had reduced visibility, so I couldn't see either driver at the time."

### **Medical Examination Notes**

1. Driver A (male):  
   - Head injuries consistent with impact to the frontal bone.
   - Possible internal bleeding due to blood loss from the crash.

2. Driver B (female):  
   - Chest injuries from impact to the abdomen and ribcage.
   - No immediate airway obstruction noted during examination.

### **Conclusion**

The collision appears to have been caused by a combination of driver error, reduced visibility due to light rain, and potentially over-speeding on Rautakallio Yrityskaavio. The investigation is ongoing to determine the exact cause of the accident and identify any contributing factors.
