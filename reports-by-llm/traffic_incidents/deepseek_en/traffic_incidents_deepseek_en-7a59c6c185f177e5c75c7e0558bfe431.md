*Location: Kokemäki, Finland*

On Monday morning, February 21, 2023, at approximately 7:45 AM, an tragic traffic incident occurred near the intersection of "Lakelinnankatu" and "Myllykyläntori." The scene involved a significant number of vehicles—eleven in total—and led to injuries and extensive property damage. The investigation revealed that the accident was likely exacerbated by the icy conditions combined with reduced visibility due to heavy snowfall.

The primary suspect, **Mr. Pertti Koski**, a 45-year-old male driver from Helsinki, was reported to have lost control of his vehicle while attempting to navigate a sharp turn on Lakelinnankatu. Witnesses described him as driving erratically before losing traction and skidding onto the shoulder. The impact caused a chain reaction, resulting in multiple vehicles being involved.

Among the victims were several children, including **Ella Kivinen**, 12 years old, who sustained injuries to her leg after being thrown from her school bus during the collision. Another child, **Mika Salo**, 8 years old, was reported to have minor injuries and was treated at Kokemäki General Hospital.

The accident investigation revealed that the icy roads played a significant role in the incident. Snow tires were installed on Mr. Koski's vehicle, but it appeared he may have driven without sufficient warming time before the collision. Authorities are reviewing the installation of snow tires as part of their ongoing assessment to prevent future incidents.

Emergency services responded promptly and provided first aid at the scene. Paramedics treated all victims, while police conducted interviews with drivers and witnesses. The investigation is ongoing, focusing on reconstructing the accident's timeline and identifying any potential contributing factors beyond weather conditions.

The aftermath revealed scattered debris from the vehicles involved, indicating a chaotic collision scenario. Authorities have cordoned off the area for further examination and will collaborate with local authorities to ensure a thorough investigation into this multi-vehicle incident.

This report highlights the importance of adhering to road safety guidelines, especially in adverse weather conditions, and underscores the need for improved infrastructure in icy areas.
