At approximately 14:30 local time, a traffic incident involving two vehicles occurred on the outskirts of Kinnula.

Below is a detailed account of the incident as reconstructed by the Traffic Accident Investigation Unit.

### **Incident Overview**  
The collision occurred at the intersection of Kinnula Road and Kivipelto Lane, a busy area near the town center. The primary factor contributing to the accident was the presence of foggy weather conditions, which reduced visibility and made it difficult for drivers to maintain control of their vehicles.

### **Driver A: Olli Lehto**  
Olli Lehto, a 38-year-old driver from Helsinki, was traveling northbound on Kinnula Road in his gray Toyota Corolla. According to witness accounts, Lehto lost control of his vehicle due to the inability to see ahead clearly under the foggy conditions. The collision occurred when Lehto attempted to make a right turn onto Kivipelto Lane and failed to negotiate the curve safely.

Lehto sustained injuries to both his left shoulder and chest, requiring immediate medical attention. He was pronounced stable at the hospital following the incident.

### **Driver B: Riina Soinen**  
Riina Soinen, a 42-year-old driver from Porvoo, was traveling westbound on Kivipelto Lane in her dark blue Ford Transit van. Soinen had been driving for approximately 15 minutes prior to the collision and reported that she had not encountered any issues with visibility during her commute.

The van collided with Lehto's car at the intersection, causing both vehicles to be damaged beyond recognition. Several passengers in Soinen's van were also injured: Emma Kivipelto (age 24) sustained minor injuries to her head and arm, while her passenger, Tuomas Lehto (age 18), was treated for a broken leg.

### **Witness Statements**  
A witness at the scene described the conditions as "foggy" and reported that visibility had dropped below one hundred meters within five minutes of the collision. Another witness noted that both drivers appeared to be driving under normal circumstances, without any signs of fatigue or distraction.

### **Road Conditions**  
The fog, which began forming early in the morning, gradually intensified throughout the day. By 14:30 local time, visibility had dropped significantly, making it unsafe for drivers to rely solely on headlights for navigation. Neither driver reported using their side mirrors or brake lights during the incident.

### **Emergency Services and Forensic Analysis**  
The scene was cordoned off immediately following the collision. Police officers conducted an investigation and recovered both vehicles at the scene. forensic examinations revealed that Lehto's Toyota Corolla had suffered moderate front-end damage, while Soinen's Ford Transit van exhibited signs of a head-on collision with significant structural deformation.

---

### **Conclusion**  
The incident was deemed to be the result of a combination of foggy weather conditions and an aggressive driving pattern by Driver A. Both drivers were treated for injuries at local hospitals and have since been released. The investigation is ongoing, and charges will be brought against Lehto in accordance with traffic laws.
