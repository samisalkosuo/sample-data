### Participants:

The incident involved two vehicles on a narrow residential road near the town center of Raasepori. The drivers were identified as **Mikko Lehto** (43 years old) and **Anna Kivinen** (28 years old). Both were residents of Raasepori, residing at different addresses within the same neighborhood.

### Weather Conditions:

The incident occurred under windy conditions with gusts reaching up to 30 km/h. The wind was blowing from the north, exacerbating visibility on the narrow road and contributing to the accident's severity.

### Timeline:

- **10:15 AM**: Mikko Lehto, driving a **Toyota Camry** (license plate FI-98765), approached the intersection where Anna Kivinen, in her **Honda Civic** (license plate FI-45678), was turning left. The wind began to pick up, reducing visibility significantly.
  
- **10:20 AM**: As Lehto tried to yield right to Kivinen's vehicle at the stop sign, he lost control of his Camry due to reduced traction from the strong winds. The impact resulted in a head-on collision with the Civic.

### Vehicle Damage:

- **Toyota Camry**: Front-end deformation and bumper damage.
- **Honda Civic**: Rear-end damage consistent with an abrupt stop before the collision.

### Conclusion:

The accident was deemed caused by a combination of reduced visibility due to strong winds, Lehto's inability to control his vehicle at the intersection, and Kivinen's failure to adjust for the wind conditions when making a sudden turn. Both vehicles sustained moderate damage, with Lehto reporting injuries requiring further medical attention.
