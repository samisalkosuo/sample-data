At approximately 15:30 local time, a traffic collision occurred on the N-75 National Road in the vicinity of the village of Kruunusillat. The incident involved two motor vehicles, which were believed to be traveling in opposite directions when they collided head-on near a construction site. 

The driver of one of the vehicles, identified as John Doe (age 42, male), was pronounced at the scene with injuries requiring immediate medical attention. He was transported to Kerava General Hospital for treatment. The other vehicle sustained minor damage and was towed away by local authorities after the collision. No further collisions were reported following the event.

Weather conditions at the time of the incident included a northwesterly wind with gusts reaching speeds of up to 35 km/h, combined with partly cloudy skies. Visibility was reduced due to the force of the wind, which made driving conditions challenging for all parties involved.

The road itself appeared to be in reasonable condition prior to the collision, though the presence of loose gravel along the embankments and recent construction activity had contributed to localized surface irregularities. This may have exacerbated the impact of the collision.

Initial investigations revealed that both drivers were traveling at speeds exceeding the posted limit on the N-75 National Road, which has a maximum speed limit of 80 km/h. The exact cause of the collision remains under investigation, but preliminary findings suggest that alcohol was not a factor in the incident.

Witnesses reported that both vehicles appeared to be well-maintained, with no apparent attempts to elude law enforcement officers. Authorities have since recovered identification badges from both vehicles and are working collaboratively with the Finnish National Police to identify the drivers involved.

The investigation is ongoing, and further updates will be provided once additional evidence becomes available. Until then, the safety of all road users in Kerava remains a priority for local authorities.
