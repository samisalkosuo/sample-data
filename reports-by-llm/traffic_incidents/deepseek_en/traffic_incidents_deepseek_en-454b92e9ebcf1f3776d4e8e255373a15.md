The accident occurred at approximately 4:30 PM in front of the Vöyri Community Center on Vöyri Street. Driver A was stopped at a red light when Driver B failed to yield and struck the Camry from behind.

The Ford Transit, which had come to a stop in front of a local store, was struck from the side by the Camry's impact. Witnesses reported debris scattered across the road and broken windows near the scene. 

Emergency services arrived within 15 minutes, assisted by local authorities. The investigation revealed that Driver B was at fault due to inadequate brake lights and failure to signal before acceleration.
