*Date: 13th September 2023*  
*Municipality: Loimaa, Finland*

At approximately 19:45 local time, an incident involving two vehicles occurred on the outskirts of Loimaa. The scene was located at the intersection of Kruunusillat and Rautakallio, a quiet residential area known for its scenic beauty but also notorious for its challenging road conditions during winter months.

The primary vehicle involved was a small passenger car, driven by 34-year-old Teuvo Lehto from Helsinki. Mr. Lehto was traveling northbound on Kruunusillat Road when he lost control of his vehicle due to unexpected snow conditions. The sudden accumulation of snow had reduced visibility significantly, making it difficult for Mr. Lehto to maintain his speed and avoid a sharp turn at the intersection.

As Mr. Lehto attempted to navigate the curve, his vehicle slid towards another stationary vehicle, a compact SUV owned by 42-year-old Anna Maria Kivipelto, who was traveling in the opposite direction on Rautakallio Road. The collision occurred under low-light conditions, exacerbating the difficulty of assessing surroundings and maintaining control.

Both vehicles sustained substantial damage following the impact. The SUV suffered front-end deformation, while the passenger car experienced structural damage to its front bumper and side impact. Emergency services responded promptly, rendering assistance to both occupants. Mr. Lehto was treated for injuries including擦伤 and minor fractures, while Mrs. Kivipelto remained conscious but showed signs of fatigue from the incident.

Weather conditions played a significant role in the incident. The snowfall had been ongoing since early evening, with accumulating layers on the roads. Snow tires were recommended but not utilized by either driver, highlighting the importance of proper vehicle preparation for winter travel.

This incident underscores the need for enhanced road safety measures, including improved signage and awareness campaigns to remind drivers of the risks associated with driving in snowy conditions. Authorities are encouraged to review current snow-clearing protocols to ensure optimal road safety during future encounters.

The investigation is ongoing, focusing on reviewing both drivers' behavior under adverse weather conditions as well as the effectiveness of their respective vehicles' winter tires. Preliminary findings suggest that Mr. Lehto's failure to maintain control was a contributing factor, while Mrs. Kivipelto appeared to be at fault for not securing her vehicle before departure.

This report serves as a reminder of the challenges posed by snowy conditions and the importance of preparedness in mitigating such risks on future journeys.
