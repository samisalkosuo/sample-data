On April 2nd, 2024, at approximately 1:30 AM local time, a traffic incident occurred on the street of Laksonkatu in Uusikaarlepyy. The collision involved three vehicles and resulted in injuries to two drivers and one passenger.

The accident began when driver Sami Salo, operating a compact car, failed to yield to pedestrian Eeva Kivinen who was crossing the road near the intersection with Rautakirjall street. Salo's vehicle attempted to make a sharp left turn onto Laksonkatu but lost control due to reduced visibility caused by heavy rain and strong winds. The impact sent Salo's car into oncoming traffic, where it struck another vehicle operated by Juhani Koski, a truck involved in construction.

The third vehicle, a utility van operated by Lauri Mäenpää, sustained damage from the collision with Salo's car. Mäenpää reported that he was driving carefully but lost focus due to poor visibility and attempted to avoid the accident by pulling into a side street, narrowly missing a bicyclist who had stopped at a red light.

Eyewitness accounts from bystander Anna Lehto confirmed that visibility was severely reduced during the night, making it difficult for drivers to perceive their surroundings. Witnesses also noted that Salo's vehicle appeared to be under significant stress before the collision, possibly due to fatigue or distraction.

The pedestrian Kivinen reported that she had been walking home and did not attempt to cross the street after noticing the oncoming traffic. She was unharmed but shaken by the incident.

Uusikaarlepyy City Council is investigating the incident along with local police to determine the exact causes, which may include alcohol consumption or fatigue contributing to Salo's impaired driving behavior.

This incident highlights the risks of driving under adverse weather conditions and the importance of maintaining vigilance in all traffic situations.
