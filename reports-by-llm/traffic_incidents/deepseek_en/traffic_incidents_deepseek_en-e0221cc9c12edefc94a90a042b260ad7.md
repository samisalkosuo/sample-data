**Incident Report: Traffic Collision in Teuva, Finland**

**Date:** 18.06.2024  
**Municipality:** Teuva, Lapland Region  

This report details a traffic collision that occurred on June 18, 2024, at approximately 21:30 local time in the municipality of Teuva, Finland. The incident involved two vehicles and resulted in injuries to both drivers and passengers.

**Weather Conditions:** Foggy  
The evening weather conditions were characterized by dense fog, which began to thicken as the report time approached. Visibility was significantly reduced, particularly during the later hours of the evening, making it challenging for drivers to maintain or regain their situational awareness.

**Road Conditions:** The road surface was in good condition, though wet patches had formed due to earlier rain showers. These conditions contributed to hydroplaning and skidding behaviors among the vehicles involved.

**Incident Overview:**
At approximately 20:45 local time, two passenger vehicles collided near the intersection of Lakelandsv√§gen and Fjordview Street in Teuva. The collision occurred when driver John Doe (age 43) failed to yield to pedestrian Sarah Johnson (age 31), who had been crossing the road at a nearby crosswalk. The impact was severe, causing both vehicles to skid into each other.

**Weather and Visibility:**
The fog began to obscure drivers' vision as early as 20:00 local time. By 20:45, visibility had diminished significantly, making it difficult for drivers to perceive potential hazards or respond appropriately. This contributed to the inability of John Doe to notice Sarah Johnson at the crosswalk until she had already entered the road.

**Vehicle Damage and Injuries:**
- **Driver's Vehicle (Model: Peugeot 208, License Plate: PEQ 12A)**
  - Driver John Doe sustained injuries to his left eye due to debris from the vehicle ahead.
  - The front bumper was severely deformed following the collision.

- **Passenger's Vehicle (Model: Volvo S90, License Plate: VTO 45B)**
  - Passenger Michael Brown (age 38) suffered burns on his right side due to contact with the windscreen.
  - The bumper of this vehicle was also damaged beyond recognition.

**Witness Statement:**
A witness, Robert Wilson (age 29), a local resident, reported that he had seen both vehicles involved in the collision. He stated, "I was approaching the crosswalk when I noticed the two cars colliding. Neither pedestrian appeared to be hit." Wilson further described that the fog had made it difficult for him to see the impact point until after it occurred.

**Conclusion:**
The incident was exacerbated by the foggy weather conditions, which reduced visibility and hindered drivers' ability to perceive their surroundings accurately. Additionally, potential factors such as driver distraction or fatigue may have contributed to the collision. Further investigation is required to determine the exact circumstances surrounding this event.
