On the evening of Monday, 15th February 2023, at approximately 10:30 PM, a traffic collision occurred near the intersection of Kivipelto Street and Rautio Lane in the municipality of Liperi, Finland. The incident involved two vehicles, resulting in injuries to both drivers.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**  
The weather on the night of the incident was clear and sunny, with visibility slightly decreasing towards midnight due to a natural phenomenon unrelated to the collision. The road surface remained dry, though vehicle lights had rendered some portions of the roadways temporarily hazy for drivers.

**Accident Timeline:**  
At approximately 10:30 PM, driver Emma Lindström (aged 42) was traveling north on Kivipelto Street in her private passenger car, which was struck from behind by driver Tuomas Kivipelto (aged 38), operating a brown-colored light commercial vehicle. The collision occurred at the intersection with Rautio Lane, where Emma had entered the road to make a left-hand turn.

**Vehicle Damage and Injuries:**  
The private passenger car sustained moderate damage, including front bumper crush marks and rear-end deformation. Driver Tuomas Kivipelto reported that his vehicle's front window was shattered due to the collision force. 

Driver Emma Lindström suffered serious injuries, including a broken leg and internal injuries requiring immediate medical attention. She was transported to Liperi General Hospital for treatment. Driver Tuomas Kivipelto reported minor injuries, specifically a sprained ankle.

**Witness Statements:**  
Eyewitnesses nearby, including Maria Rautio and Eero Soininen, corroborated the collision scene. They described both vehicles as being involved in the accident near the cul-de-sac area on Kivipelto Street, with no other traffic present at the time of the incident.

**Investigation Findings:**  
The investigation concluded that Tuomas Kivipelto was driving under the influence of alcohol, which had led to his failure to yield to Emma Lindström's pedestrian crossing and his inability to react promptly due to fatigue from extensive night shifts in the city center. The driver of the private passenger car was operating within the legal speed limit but failed to maintain proper distance from Tuomas Kivipelto.

**Conclusion:**  
The incident was deemed a result of alcohol-related driving combined with insufficient vigilance following long working hours. Both vehicles were towed away by Finnish Traffic Police officers for further investigation, and no formal charges have been filed at this stage.
