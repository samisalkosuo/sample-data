**Incident Summary Report:**

**Date:** December 27, 2023  
**Location:** Kurikka, Finland  
**Time of Incident:** 1:30 AM

On the evening of December 27, 2023, a tragic traffic incident occurred in the village of Kurikka. The collision involved two vehicles, resulting in injuries to both parties involved.

**Detailed Account of the Incident:**

At approximately 1:30 AM, a small passenger car driven by Tuomas Lehto was traveling northbound on Rautakirjankatu, a quiet residential street known for its early morning traffic. Suddenly, a medium-sized truck, operated by Antti Kivinen and carrying passengers Marta Nieminen and Salla-Petra Vuorinen, entered the intersection from the opposite direction without properly stopping.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The wet and slippery conditions played a significant role in the incident. The misty morning combined with low visibility made it difficult for drivers to perceive their surroundings accurately. The truck's attempt to navigate these challenging conditions led to hydroplaning, exacerbating the accident.

**Witness Statements:**

Eyewitnesses reported that both vehicles collided head-on near the intersection of Rautakirjankatu and Yrityskyl√§inen Rinti, a side street with limited visibility. The impact was severe enough to cause injuries in both parties involved. Eyewitnesses noted that the wetness of the road likely contributed to the accident but did not admit fault.

**Vehicle Descriptions:**

- **Passenger Vehicle:** A 2018 Toyota Yaris, registered as XXXX-TH-LK78 with driver Tuomas Lehto and passenger Leena Soininen.
- **Truck:** A 2020 Toyota Fortuner, registered as XXXX-TH-MN45 operated by Antti Kivinen.

**Conclusion:**

The investigation concluded that the primary cause of the incident was the failure to stop before entering the intersection. The truck's disregard for traffic signals and the challenging road conditions exacerbated the accident. Both drivers were found at fault, with the truck driver contributing significantly to the collision due to his inexperience or distraction.
