At approximately 19:35, a traffic collision occurred near the intersection of Kruunusillat Street and Rautakyläväntie in Orivesi. The incident involved three vehicles, with injuries reported to emergency services.

**Narrative of Events:**

Two passenger vehicles, a Toyota Camry (Vehicle ID: 12345) driven by Mr. Juhani Paasiniemi and a Honda Civic (Vehicle ID: 67890) operated by Ms. Salla Kivipelto, were approaching the intersection from opposite directions when foggy conditions obscured their surroundings. Mr. Paasiniemi failed to yield due to reduced visibility, leading to an abrupt stop. Meanwhile, Ms. Kivipelto's vehicle was attempting to navigate the narrow path and narrowly avoided a collision with a third vehicle, a smaller car (Vehicle ID: 34567) driven by Mr. Pertti Lehto.

The impact resulted in injuries reported by Mr. Lehto, who sustained minor fractures. Both vehicles suffered minor damage, including front-end deformation on the Camry and Civic.

**Weather Impact:** The fog significantly reduced visibility to about 200 meters, contributing to the drivers' inability to anticipate each other's movements. This led to an unintended collision shortly after the vehicles entered the vicinity of the intersection.

**Vehicle Descriptions:**

- **Toyota Camry (12345):** Silver with dark accents, registered to Juhani Paasiniemi.
- **Honda Civic (67890):** Red with white stripes, registered to Salla Kivipelto.
- **Smaller Car (34567):** Black variant, registered to Pertti Lehto.

**Aftermath:**

Emergency services arrived at the scene within 10 minutes. Mr. Lehto was the primary witness and reported seeing smoke from the vehicles. Police officers assessed the area, noting scattered debris and a small fire near the collision site. No fatalities were reported, but injuries were treated on-site before being transferred to local hospitals.

**Conclusion:**

The investigation into the incident is ongoing, with further tests scheduled for the vehicles involved. Police are collaborating with medical teams to ensure all parties receive appropriate care. The foggy conditions played a significant role in the accident's occurrence, highlighting the importance of enhanced visibility measures during low-light conditions.
