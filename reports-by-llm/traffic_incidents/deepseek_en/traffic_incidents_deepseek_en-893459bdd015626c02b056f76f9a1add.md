At approximately 07:30 local time on the morning of 04.08.2024, a traffic incident occurred at the intersection of Kruunusillat and Rautakylänti in Isokyrö, Finland. The collision involved two vehicles, a small passenger car (Vehicle A) and a medium-sized truck (Vehicle B), both traveling in opposite directions on a section of icy road that had recently been cleared.

The driver of Vehicle A, identified as Olli Kivinen (age 42, male), was traveling northbound on Rautakylänti towards Kruunusillat. The driver of Vehicle B, identified as Riitta Lehto (age 38, female), was traveling southbound on Kruunusillat heading towards Rautakylänti. According to witness accounts and初步 investigations, both drivers appeared to be under the influence of alcohol at the time of the incident.

The icy conditions significantly impacted road visibility, leading to reduced braking distance and increased reaction times for both drivers. Vehicle A lost control on a sharp curve near the intersection due to hydroplaning, skidding onto the sidewalk, and colliding with Vehicle B. The collision resulted in minor injuries reported by the drivers, including擦伤 and slight burns.

Both vehicles sustained damage following the impact. Vehicle A suffered front-end deformation and minor damage to its bumper, while Vehicle B experienced rear-end damage and a small crack on its side mirror. Authorities have cordially invited witnesses to provide additional details regarding the incident, which are being collected for further investigation.

The incident has been classified as a possible case of alcohol-related driving under the influence (DUI). Police officers will conduct further analysis, including breathalyzer tests on both drivers, to determine if charges will be pursued. The icy road conditions and the drivers' impaired state have contributed to the collision, which has caused minor traffic disruptions in the area.

This report is a factual summary of the incident as observed by law enforcement and available evidence. Further updates will be provided once the investigation is completed.
