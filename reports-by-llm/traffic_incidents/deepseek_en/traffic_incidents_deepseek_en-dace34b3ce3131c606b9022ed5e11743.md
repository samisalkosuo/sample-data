At approximately 23:15 local time on the night of Monday, 10 November 2022, a traffic incident occurred in the area of Kruunusillat and Rautakallio within Keminmaa. The collision involved three motor vehicles, with no injuries reported to emergency services at this time.

The scene was located near the intersection of Kruunusillat and Rautakallio, a quiet residential area known for its snow-covered roads during late autumn. Weather conditions included heavy snowfall with blowing snow, resulting in low visibility and slippery road surfaces due to residual ice from the previous night's freezing rain.

The primary driver involved was Anna Lehto, operating a 2018 Toyota Camry. Conditions on the road made it difficult for Lehto to maintain control of her vehicle as she attempted to navigate the slippery terrain. The impact occurred when Lehto lost control of her car, resulting in a head-on collision with Saku Kivinen's 2017 Honda Civic.

The third vehicle involved was a 2016 Ford Transit, operated by Teppo Mäenpää. The Transit sustained damage to its front bumper following the collision. Witnesses reported that the driver of the Camry had failed to yield right-of-way at the intersection and had driven aggressively, contributing to the accident.

Weather conditions exacerbated the situation, as heavy snowfall made it difficult for drivers to maintain traction and respond effectively to sudden stops or starts. The impact from the initial collision caused a chain reaction, leading to the collision with the Ford Transit.

Emergency services arrived within five minutes of the scene, finding all vehicles damaged beyond repair. No injuries were reported at this time, but the incident has been classified as precautionary due to the heavy snowfall and vehicle damage.

The investigation concluded that the primary driver's aggressive driving contributed significantly to the accident. Further details on speed limits and road conditions will be provided by local authorities in accordance with procedural requirements.
