**Date:** October 10, 2024  
**Municipality:** Vaasa  

At approximately 7:30 AM, a traffic collision occurred near the intersection of Kruunusillat and Säkyläinen in Vaasa. The incident involved four vehicles, including two passenger cars, one small货车, and a truck. The weather conditions at the time included heavy rain in some areas coupled with light snowfall, significantly impacting visibility and vehicle performance.

The collision was reported by traffic officers to have resulted from an emergency brake failure on one of the vehicles. Witnesses described that driver Mr. Antti Kivinen lost control while attempting to navigate a sharp turn on a slippery road. His vehicle collided with a pedestrian who had been crossing the street, sustained injuries in her car, and another vehicle was also damaged beyond recognition.

Mr. Kivinen, a construction worker from Helsinki, was uninjured but required first aid for minor injuries. Ms. Liisa Nieminen, the pedestrian, received moderate injuries requiring immediate medical attention. The truck driver, Mr. Pertti Laine, reported no physical injuries despite sustaining minor damage to his vehicle.

Witnesses on scene corroborated these accounts, with one stating that the rain and snow made it particularly challenging for drivers to maintain control. Authorities are investigating whether additional collisions occurred as a result of the initial incident.

**Conclusion:** The investigation revealed that the primary cause was Mr. Kivinen's failure to adjust his vehicle's brakes in adverse weather conditions. Authorities have advised all drivers to increase following distances and ensure their vehicles are equipped with appropriate winter tires during such conditions.

This incident underscores the importance of enhanced road safety measures, particularly in challenging weather scenarios. Further details will be shared as the investigation progresses.
