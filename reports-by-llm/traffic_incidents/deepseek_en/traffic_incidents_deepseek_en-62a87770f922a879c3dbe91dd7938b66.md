At approximately 9:30 AM on Monday, August 26, 2023, a traffic collision occurred near the intersection of Kruunusillat 12A and Rautakyläinenkatu in Somero, Finland. The incident involved two passenger vehicles, a Toyota Aygo (Model Year 2018) and a light utility vehicle (Model Year 2015). 

The collision was reported by a witness on behalf of Mrs. Anna Lehto, who resides at Kruunusillat 12A. She observed the accident occurring near the gas station on Rautakyläinenkatu, which is a busy street in the downtown area. The witness described both drivers as being visibly shaken but not injured.

Weather conditions during the incident included light rain, which reduced visibility and made driving challenging for all parties involved. The rain caused the drivers to slow down and maintain greater distances between their vehicles, though this did not prevent the collision.

The Toyota Aygo sustained minor damage to its front bumper and side impact, while the utility vehicle reported damage to its fenders and a small crack in its windshield. Both vehicles were assessed by the on-site traffic officer, who determined that the accident was an unavoidable offset collision due to the sudden swerving of one driver in poor road conditions.

Witnesses reported hearing a loud bang followed by the impact of the two vehicles. No injuries were reported from either driver or any passengers involved in the collision. The drivers were able to provide clear statements to the traffic officer, who conducted a thorough investigation into the incident.

**Conclusion:**  
The collision occurred due to an unavoidable offset collision on a narrow urban road with reduced visibility caused by light rain. Both drivers were determined to be at fault for their respective actions prior to the accident. No alcohol was detected in either driver's system.

**Recommendation:**  
All drivers are advised to exercise extreme caution when driving through urban areas, especially during periods of precipitation, as weather conditions can significantly impact road safety.
