*Date: 05.03.2024*  
*Municipality: Forssa, Finland*  

At approximately 1:45 AM local time on March 5th, 2024, a traffic collision occurred near the intersection of Kruunusillat and Rautakalliostraat in Forssa. The incident involved two motor vehicles, resulting in injuries to both drivers and passengers.  

The weather conditions at the time were wet and slippery, contributing significantly to the accident. Nighttime visibility was severely reduced due to poor lighting conditions, making it difficult for drivers to perceive their surroundings accurately.  

**Incident Narrative:**  
Driver A, identified as Olli Kivinen (age 42), was traveling northbound on Rautakalliostraat towards Kruunusillat when his Toyota Camry failed to decelerate in time due to reduced traction caused by the slippery wet路面. In response, Driver B, identified as Riina Lehto (age 38), operating a Ford Transit westbound on Kruunusillat, attempted to avoid collision by swerving sharply. This sudden maneuver resulted in an unintended collision at the intersection.  

The impact occurred approximately 50 meters from the point where Rautakalliostraat turns into Kruunusillat. Both vehicles sustained front-end damage following the collision. Driver A was pronounced dead at the scene due to injuries including head injuries and internal bleeding. Driver B, however, survived with minor injuries such as a broken leg and superficial cuts.  

**Witness Statements:**  
- Witness Emma Nieminen (age 28) stated that she observed both vehicles approaching the intersection from opposite directions when the sudden swerve by the Ford Transit caused her to glance in the opposite direction just in time to avoid collision.  
- Witness Tommi Vuorinen (age 35) corroborated the account, adding that he was traveling eastbound on Kruunusillat and did not perceive any obstacle at the time of impact.  

**Conclusion:**  
The accident investigators have concluded that the primary contributing factor to the incident was the combination of wet and slippery road conditions and Driver B's sudden swerve in an attempt to avoid collision. The investigation is ongoing, with a focus on assessing the extent of injuries sustained by both parties involved.  

This incident highlights the importance of adhering to traffic regulations, especially under adverse weather conditions, to prevent such tragedies. Authorities are reminding drivers to increase their following distance, reduce speed, and remain vigilant in all weather conditions.
