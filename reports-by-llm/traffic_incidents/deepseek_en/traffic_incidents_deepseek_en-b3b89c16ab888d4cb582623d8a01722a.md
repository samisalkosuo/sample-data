**Narrative:**

On the evening of Monday, November 25, 2023, at approximately 7:15 PM, a traffic incident occurred near the intersection of Rautakirjikatu and Syrjoki Street in Virolahti. The incident involved two vehicles, each with occupants.

The driver of the first vehicle, identified as John Doe (age 42), was traveling on Syrjoki Street towards Rautakirjikatu when he lost control of his vehicle due to heavy rain and alcohol consumption. His vehicle, a 2018 Toyota Yaris, entered the opposing lane where Ms. Jane Smith (age 38) was driving her 2019 Ford Explorer with her 2-year-old daughter, Emily.

Ms. Smith had stopped at a red light on Syrjoki Street when John Doe's vehicle swerved into her lane in an attempt to avoid hydroplaning and regain control. The collision occurred near the intersection, resulting in injuries to both vehicles' occupants. Mr. Doe sustained injuries to his head and neck, while Ms. Smith reported moderate injuries to her left shoulder.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

The heavy rain significantly impacted visibility and grip on the wet roads. This contributed to John Doe's inability to control his vehicle, leading to hydroplaning and the collision with Jane Smith's vehicle.

**Vehicle Details:**

   - **Year:** 2018
   - **Make/Model:** Toyota Yaris
   - **License Plate:** FI-1234567

   - **Make/Model:** Ford Explorer
   - **License Plate:** FI-7890123

**Timeline:**

1. John Doe was returning from work when he entered the intersection on Rautakirjikatu.
2. Heavy rain caused hydroplaning and reduced his vehicle's control.
3. He swerved into Syrjoki Street, where Jane Smith had stopped at a red light.
4. Collision occurred near the intersection, sustaining injuries to both vehicles' occupants.

**Witness Statements:**

- Mr. Kivinen from the local police station reported seeing the collision and estimated the impact speed to be moderate.
- Annahti Koski, a resident on Syrjoki Street, corroborated the report, noting that John Doe had been driving erratically before the incident.

**Conclusion:**

The incident was caused by John Doe's intoxication, which impaired his ability to drive safely. The heavy rain exacerbating the conditions led to hydroplaning and an inability to avoid the collision. Both vehicles sustained damage consistent with moderate injuries reported by the occupants.
