The collision occurred at approximately 7:15 AM near the intersection of Kruunusillat and Rautakylä. The primary vehicle involved was a large articulated truck, driven by Mr. Eero Kivinen, operating for the Ilmarin Logistics company.

Witnesses reported that the scene was dominated by smoke and debris, with several vehicles severely damaged. Emergency services, including the Ilmajoki Fire Department and ambulance service, arrived promptly but found multiple casualties.

**Weather Conditions:**

The morning commute in Ilmajoki was already challenging due to heavy fog caused by the approaching storm. Visibility dropped to a mere 200 meters, making it nearly impossible for drivers to see more than a few feet ahead.
