Date: 23rd August 2024  
Municipality: Mynämäki  

This report outlines a traffic incident that occurred on the morning of 23rd August 2024 in Mynämäki, Finland. The collision involved two vehicles and resulted in minor injuries to both drivers and passengers. The scene was captured by witnesses at the scene, who provided statements consistent with the circumstances.

**Vehicles Involved:**  
1. **Vehicle 1**: A compact passenger car (2023 model year) driven by Eeva Kivipelto. The vehicle sustained damage to its front bumper and windshield after the collision.
2. **Vehicle 2**: An SUV (2022 model year) driven by Juhani Lehtimäki, who was traveling eastbound on Rautakirjalankatu. The SUV suffered minor damage to its side mirror.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**  
The incident occurred under windy conditions with gusts reaching speeds of 35 km/h. Visibility was reduced due to the wind, making it challenging for drivers to maintain their lanes or react promptly. Additionally, a small oil spill from a stopped truck on the road contributed to slippery patches, potentially increasing the risk of skidding.

**Timeline:**  
- **07:15 AM**: Eeva Kivipelto was traveling northbound on Rautakirjalankatu towards Suvakartilta when she lost control due to reduced visibility and began weaving between traffic cones.
- **07:23 AM**: Juhani Lehtimäki, traveling eastbound on Rautakirjalankatu, failed to yield to Kivipelto's vehicle as it exited the intersection. The collision occurred at the crosswalk near the town hall.
- **07:25 AM**: Both vehicles skidded into a patch of oil created by a stopped truck further down the road.

**Narrative Account:**  
Eeva Kivipelto was attempting to make a left turn onto Suvakartilta when she lost control, swerving sharply and colliding with Juhani Lehtimäki's SUV. The impact caused both vehicles to skid into the wet patch from the truck, which had been parked on the shoulder earlier in the morning due to rain.

**Damage Description:**  
- **Eeva Kivipelto**: Front bumper sustaining minor dents; windshield slightly chips.
- **Juhani Lehtimäki**: Rear side mirror sustaining a small dent; no injuries reported.

**Statements by Witness(es):**  
1. **Mikko Soinen (Witness 1)**: "I was at the front door when I heard the crash. Both cars were going fast, and it looked like they didn't see each other."  
2. **Anna Kumpa (Witness 2)**: "I was at the back entrance when the collision happened. The accident seemed sudden, and both drivers appeared disoriented."

**Conclusion:**  
The incident appears to be a case of driver fatigue due to reduced visibility from the morning rush hour and windy conditions. Both drivers were traveling under suboptimal road conditions and failed to yield appropriately.
