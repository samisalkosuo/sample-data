### **Narrative of the Incident**

At approximately 09:30 local time on Monday, January 26, 2025, a severe traffic incident occurred near the intersection of Kruunusillat and Rautakartilinna in Liminka. The collision involved three vehicles, all of which sustained significant damage. The primary vehicle, a passenger car driven by 48-year-old Eero Nieminen (responsible for driving), was pronounced dead at the scene due to injuries sustained during the accident. His 26-year-old passenger, Pirjo Kivimäki, was also injured but remained conscious and in stable condition following parametric assistance.

The second vehicle, a light truck operated by 34-year-old Juhani Vuorinen (operator), suffered partial structural damage to its front bumper and was unable to move. The third vehicle, an industrial trailer truck driven by 52-year-old Leena Soininen (operator), had its rear axle separated during the collision.

Witnesses reported that both drivers were traveling in opposite directions on a narrow, two-lane road when their paths converged at the aforementioned intersection. The weather conditions at the time included icy roads, which significantly impacted visibility and grip, making it difficult for drivers to maintain control of their vehicles. Eero Nieminen lost control of his car due to hydroplaning, causing it to skid into the light truck driven by Juhani Vuorinen. The collision resulted in a head-on impact, trapping both occupants of the passenger car and severely injuring the operator of the industrial trailer truck.

The incident was exacerbated by the presence of an emergency vehicle from the local fire department at the scene, which had been summoned due to reports of a serious accident. The driver of this emergency vehicle, 38-year-old Riitta Kivipelto (operator), remained unharmed and cooperated fully with the investigation.

### **Weather and Road Conditions**

The incident occurred under icy road conditions, which made travel extremely hazardous. The low visibility due to ice-covered sidewalks and reduced friction between tires and路面 significantly impacted the drivers' ability to maintain control of their vehicles. Snow-clearing operations had been recently conducted but were insufficient to mitigate the icy conditions adequately.
