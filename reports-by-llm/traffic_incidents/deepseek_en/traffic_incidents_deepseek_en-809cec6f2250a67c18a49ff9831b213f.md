At approximately 19:45 hours on the evening of Monday, June 25, 2025, a severe traffic incident occurred near the Taipalsillat weighbridge in Taipalsaari, Finland. The incident involved five vehicles and resulted in injuries to two pedestrians and moderate damage to all vehicles.

The scene was located at the intersection of Kruunusillat and Lehtopuistonkat, where a heavy goods truck driven by Mr. Säätö experienced loss of control due to slippery wet roads. The truck collided with a passenger vehicle operated by Ms. Lehto, which had stopped at a red light on Lehtopuistonkat. Following the collision, the impact caused a chain reaction involving three additional vehicles: a small van driven by Mr. Kivinen and two motorbikes ridden by Mr. Nieminen and Ms. Honkasalo.

Weather conditions at the time included wet and slippery roads, which significantly impacted driving behavior and vehicle performance. The truck's hydroplaning facilitated part of the accident but also contributed to the subsequent collisions. The passenger vehicle sustained moderate front-end damage from the initial collision, while the van experienced underbody damage from the rear-end impact.

The small van was struck by the passenger vehicle first, causing it to veer off the road and collide with another motorbike in a narrow alley. Both motorbikes were severely injured during the incident. The pedestrian crossing at Kruunusillat was temporarily blocked due to the chaos of the collision sequence.

The driver of the heavy goods truck, Mr. Säätö, was uninjured but reported difficulty controlling his vehicle post-accident. Ms. Lehto sustained minor injuries and was treated at the scene by a local ambulance service. The injured pedestrians were transported to Taipalsillat hospital for further evaluation.

The incident is under investigation by the Taipalsillat police traffic unit, which will examine all vehicles involved, witness statements, and accident reconstruction data. Authorities are collaborating with local firemen and medical teams to ensure a safe resolution of the scene.

This report highlights the importance of adhering to road safety regulations, especially in adverse weather conditions, to prevent such incidents from occurring.
