### Narrative Description:

On the evening of Monday, January 19th, 2023, at approximately 1:30 AM, two motor vehicles were reported to have collided near the intersection of Kruunusillat and Syrj채nt채ri in Iitti. The scene was illuminated by emergency lights from passing vehicles due to the low visibility caused by wet and slippery road conditions.

The primary vehicle involved was a compact sedan, identified as A1B 9876, traveling northbound on Kruunusillat. The driver, John Doe (42 years old), reported that he had been driving under the influence of alcohol, which significantly impacted his ability to control the vehicle. The passenger, Sarah Johnson (35 years old), sustained injuries including a broken leg due to impact during the collision.

The second vehicle was an SUV, identified as C3D 12345, traveling southbound on Syrj채nt채ri. The driver, Michael Smith (38 years old), stated that he had been driving at a high speed and lost control of his vehicle due to hydroplaning caused by the slippery terrain. His passenger, Emily Davis (30 years old), was seriously injured with internal bleeding.

Witnesses on scene reported that both drivers appeared intoxicated and exhibited signs of fatigue, which contributed to their inability to maintain control of their vehicles. The crash occurred shortly after midnight when Doe attempted to pass Smith on a narrow road before the intersection, leading to an unavoidable collision.

Emergency Services immediately responded to the scene, treating the injured parties at the local hospital. Police arrived within 15 minutes and conducted a thorough investigation, interviewing both drivers and passengers. They also inspected the vehicles for damage, which included hydroplaning marks, front wheelspin on Doe's sedan, and scattered debris from the crash.

The investigation revealed that alcohol was a contributing factor in the incident. Both drivers were subsequently arrested under the Influence Alcohol Act, with charges pending for serious injuries sustained by their passengers.
