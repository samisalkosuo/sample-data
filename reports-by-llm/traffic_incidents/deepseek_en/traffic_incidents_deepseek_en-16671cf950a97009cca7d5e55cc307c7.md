At approximately 19:30 hours on the evening of Monday, June 23, 2024, a traffic collision occurred near the intersection of Kruunusillat and Rautaharjo in Toivakka. The incident involved two motor vehicles, specifically a 2018 Toyota Camry (Driver: Alex Johnson) and a 2019 Honda Civic (Passenger: Sarah Lee). 

The weather conditions at the time included mixed snow and rain, resulting in icy road surfaces that reduced visibility to below one hundred meters. Witnesses reported that both vehicles appeared to be traveling at speeds exceeding the posted speed limit of 60 km/h when they collided head-on. The impact occurred while the driver of the Honda Civic (Mr. Thompson) attempted an unexpected lane change, leading to a sudden swerve that caused the collision.

Emergency services arrived on scene within five minutes and immediately began assessing injuries. Both occupants were uninjured but required first aid due to minor injuries sustained during the incident. The vehicles were towed away for further inspection, with the Camry sustaining front-end damage and the Civic experiencing rear-end damage.

Weather conditions exacerbated the severity of the accident by reducing visibility and making it difficult for drivers to perceive their surroundings accurately. The investigation revealed that Mr. Thompson was driving under the influence of alcohol, which contributed significantly to the collision. A subsequent breathalyzer test confirmed his blood alcohol level exceeded the legal limit.

The Toivakka Traffic Accident Investigation Unit conducted a thorough examination of the scene, including an analysis of vehicle damage and witness statements. The investigation concluded that Mr. Thompson was at fault due to his impaired driving behavior. Further legal action is recommended to address this matter.
