*Date: 17 January 2024*  
*Municipality: Huittinen, Finland*

At approximately 1:30 AM, an tragic traffic incident occurred on the outskirts of Huittinen, involving eight vehicles. The collision took place on a quiet residential area near the town's outskirts, where visibility was reduced due to poor weather conditions—a mix of dry snow and biting cold temperatures.

The primary impact zones were located at the intersection of two well-known streets in the municipality: *Linnanranta Street* and *Kruunusillat Ylittäjat Kruunusillat*. The collision was head-on, involving multiple passenger vehicles. Emergency services responded promptly, deploying lights and sirens to reach the scene.

The investigation revealed that the drivers involved were traveling under the influence of alcohol, a substance that significantly contributed to their inability to maintain control of their vehicles. The cold weather exacerbated the effects of alcohol, impairing reaction times and judgment.

Weather conditions played a crucial role in the incident. The dry snow reduced visibility to less than 200 meters, making it nearly impossible for drivers to see each other until it was too late. The impact of this condition is evident in the fact that several vehicles were struck from behind or at an angle, leading to catastrophic damage.

The eight vehicles involved included a variety of models:  
1. A 2019 Toyota Camry, sustaining front-end damage and moderately injuries to the occupants.  
2. A 2018 Honda Civic with a sunroof, showing moderate structural damage and injuries.  
3. A 2020 Ford Transit van, with severe deformation on its left side and significant internal injuries.  
4. A 2017 Suzuki SX4, sustaining minor damage to the front bumper and injuries to passengers.  
5. A 2016 Toyota Matrix, showing moderate structural damage and injuries.  
6. A 2019 Mazda CX-5, with slight deformation on its right side and injuries noted.  
7. A 2018 Hyundai Palisade, sustaining minor damage to the front grille and injuries.  
8. A 2017 Subaru Outback, showing moderate structural damage and injuries.

Witnesses reported that the incident appeared sudden, with no apparent cause other than alcohol consumption and disregard for safety norms. The investigation further concluded that the cold weather had contributed to the drivers' negligence by impairing their ability to perceive and respond to the situation effectively.

The scene was left in a state of disarray, with all vehicles recovered and towed away for evaluation. Authorities are now assessing the extent of injuries sustained by the passengers and will pursue legal actions against those responsible.

This incident underscores the dangers of driving under the influence and highlights the importance of adhering to traffic regulations, especially in adverse weather conditions. Further investigations into the drivers' backgrounds and previous incidents are recommended to ensure public safety.
