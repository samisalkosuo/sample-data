The scene was located near the intersection of Kruunusillat Yhteisrue and Marttilan Kylpyjärvi, a quiet residential area known for its scenic views of Lake Jyväskylä.

### **Weather Conditions**

The incident took place under icy road conditions, which significantly impacted visibility. Snowflakes were falling at a moderate rate, creating slippery patches on the roads. The temperature was estimated to be around -2°C, contributing to the hazardous driving conditions.

### **Timeline of Events**

   Driver A, traveling eastbound on Kruunusillat Yhteisrue, failed to yield right-of-way at a stop sign located at the intersection with Marttilan Kylpyjärvi. This act of negligence led to a chain reaction involving multiple vehicles.

2. **Collision Sequence**  
   The initial collision occurred between Driver A’s vehicle and a stationary light truck parked on the shoulder. The impact caused both vehicles to skid, creating a barrier of debris along the road. Subsequent collisions involved additional passenger cars, all traveling in the same direction due to the lack of traffic control measures.

3. **Injury Incurred**  
   Several occupants sustained injuries as a result of the collision. Witnesses reported that the impact was so forceful that even children playing nearby were injured by flying debris.

### **Weather and Road Conditions**

The icy roads exacerbated the severity of the accident, making it difficult for drivers to maintain control of their vehicles. Snow tires were in use on several vehicles, but many drivers failed to adjust their driving behavior accordingly, leading to a dangerous situation.

### **Vehicle Damage**

- **Driver A’s Vehicle**: Severe front-end damage with multiple crushed metal components.

### **Witness Statements**

### **Conclusion**

The incident resulted in minor injuries to several individuals and significant damage to the affected vehicles. Authorities are investigating the cause, focusing on the initial failure to yield by Driver A and potential alcohol consumption among some drivers. The icy conditions played a critical role in exacerbating the accident’s severity.
