### **Weather and Road Conditions**  

The nighttime incident occurred under light rain, which significantly impacted visibility and road conditions. Rain reduced the coefficient of friction on the roads, leading to hydroplaning tendencies in both vehicles. Additionally, the wet surface made it difficult for drivers to maintain control of their vehicles, exacerbating the risk of accidents.
