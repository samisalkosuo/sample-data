**Incident Report: Traffic Collision in Luumäki, Finland - April 11, 2023**

**Date:** April 11, 2023  
**Municipality:** Luumäki  
**Number of Vehicles Involved:** 2  

At approximately 1:45 AM local time on April 11, 2023, a traffic collision occurred near the intersection of Kruunusillat and Rautakyläinen roads in Luumäki. The incident involved two motor vehicles, identified as a passenger car (Model: 2018 Toyota Camry) and a medium-duty truck (Model: 2020 Freightliner Cascadia). Both vehicles were struck by an obstruction caused by foggy conditions, resulting in minor damage to the car's front bumper and deformation to the truck's side mirror.

**Weather Conditions:** The incident occurred under foggy weather, with visibility reduced to less than a quarter mile. This made drivers unable to see each other approaching from opposite directions, leading to abrupt braking as they attempted to maintain control of their vehicles in low-light conditions.

**Timeline:**

1. **Approach:** At 1:30 AM, driver A (age 42) of the Camry was traveling north on Kruunusillat Road towards Luumäki City Center. Driver B (age 38) of the Freightliner was heading south on Rautakyläinen Road into the city.

2. **Incident Notice:** As drivers approached each other, they noticed the increasing thickness of the fog and reduced visibility. Both drivers failed to maintain a safe following distance due to their inability to detect each other's headlights.

3. **Collision:** At 1:45 AM, the two vehicles collided shortly after the drivers came into direct line-of-sight with each other. The impact occurred at an acute angle, causing both vehicles to skid and come to rest in a shallow ditch near the intersection.

4. **Post-Collision:** Attempts to contact emergency services via mobile devices were unsuccessful due to the fog. Authorities arrived on scene within 15 minutes of receiving the call, finding both drivers unharmed but shaken by the experience.

**Witness Statements:**

- **Witness Oksana Petrovna (Age 32):** A shop owner at "Luumäkin Kaupungistola" reported that she observed the accident while preparing breakfast. She stated, "The visibility was so poor; I couldn't see past the fog to determine if there was a collision or not."

- **Witness Sören Kivinen (Age 45):** A driver passing through Luumäki noted, "I had reduced my speed significantly due to the fog and almost didn't notice the oncoming traffic until it was too late. The accident occurred quickly after that."

**Conclusion:**

The incident highlights the critical importance of adhering to weather conditions when operating motor vehicles. Drivers should always reduce speed, increase following distance, and avoid relying solely on visibility aids like headlights in adverse weather. Luumäki Police emphasize the need for enhanced driver training and awareness programs to prevent such incidents in the future.

**Note:** Further investigation is ongoing to determine if charges will be filed based on traffic laws regarding reduced speed and safe driving practices under foggy conditions.
