On the morning of Monday, the 14th of May 2025, at approximately 7:30 AM local time, a traffic collision occurred near the intersection of Sävenlahti and Kylälahti in Hammarland, Finland. The incident involved two motor vehicles, resulting in minor injuries to the occupants and localized damage to the roadway surface.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**
The weather conditions at the time of the incident were mixed, featuring intermittent rain and light snowfall. Visibility was reduced due to both precipitation and low temperatures, contributing to the challenging driving conditions. The combination of wet roads and icy patches created slippery surfaces, particularly noticeable during the early morning hours.

**Timeline of Events:**

1. **Pre-Collision:**  
   At approximately 7:00 AM, vehicle A (a compact passenger car) was traveling eastbound on Sävenlahti Road towards the intersection with Kylälahti Road. The driver, identified as Olli Kivinen (age 42), reported that he had encountered a sudden patch of ice while decelerating for a pedestrian crossing.

2. **Approach to Collision:**  
   Moments later, vehicle B (a small hatchback) entered the intersection from the southbound direction on Kylälahti Road. Driver Anna-Maria Lehto (age 38), stated that she had noticed the reduced visibility and slightly braked before entering the intersection.

3. **Collision Occurrence:**  
   The two vehicles collided head-on near the center of the intersection, with vehicle A sustaining front-end damage and vehicle B experiencing rear-wheel skid. Eyewitness accounts indicated that both drivers appeared to lose control of their vehicles simultaneously as they navigated the slippery conditions.

4. **Immediate Response:**  
   The collision was reported to the local police station at 7:35 AM. Paramedics arrived within five minutes, treating minor injuries sustained by passengers and crew members. No fatalities were reported, but both drivers were advised to seek medical attention for further evaluation of potential injuries.
