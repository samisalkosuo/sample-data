The incident involved eight vehicles, including two sedans, three SUVs, one truck, a bicycle, and a utility van. The collision led to significant injuries among passengers and crew.

### Event Timeline:

1. **Morning Commute:**  
   The accident occurred approximately 45 minutes after the start of the morning rush hour in Kitee. Drivers were commuting to various locations within Helsinki, including areas near the Helsinki University dissident zone.

2. **Driver Distraction:**  
   Driver A, operating a compact sedan, was distracted by a passenger's mobile phone during a sharp left turn onto Pinegrove Lane. This action led to an unintended swerve, increasing the risk of collision.

3. **Collision Sequence:**

4. **Aftermath:**  
   Firefighters responded promptly, extinguishing the small fire caused by the utility van. Paramedics arrived within five minutes and began stabilizing victims at the scene.

### Weather and Road Conditions:

The incident was exacerbated by windy conditions with gusts reaching 25 km/h. Visibility dropped to a mere 100 meters due to heavy fog, compounded by low temperatures. This made drivers unable to maintain control of their vehicles, contributing significantly to the accident.

### Vehicle Damage Descriptions:

- **SUV 1:** Rear-end collision with a utility van; moderate injuries reported.

"I was trying to take a left turn when my phone rang. I didn't realize what I was doing."

**Driver B (SUV 1):**  
"I was following too closely and didn't notice the oncoming vehicle's sudden movement."

### Witness Statements:

- **Witness C:** "I saw the swerve in front of me, but couldn't tell which side it was. The fog made everything smoky."
- **Witness D:** "The accident looked like a chain reaction; I thought someone hit another car first."

### Aftermath:

At 08:30 local time, Kitee Police arrived at the scene and interviewed all parties. Statements were exchanged with insurance companies. A preliminary investigation revealed no immediate charges but highlighted potential fatigue driving as a contributing factor.

**Investigation:**  
The case is under investigation by the Road Traffic Crash Investigation Unit. Further evidence collection is ongoing to determine liability and reconstruct the accident sequence.

### Conclusion:

This incident underscores the dangers of distracted driving in adverse weather conditions. The multi-vehicle collision highlights the need for enhanced driver awareness systems and improved road safety measures, particularly in urban environments with frequent fog.
