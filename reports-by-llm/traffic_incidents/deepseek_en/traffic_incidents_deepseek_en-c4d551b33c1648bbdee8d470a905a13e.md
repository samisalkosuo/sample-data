### **Narrative Description**

On the evening of Monday, December 15, 2023, at approximately 19:45 local time, a traffic collision occurred in Posio, Finland. The incident involved two vehicles and resulted in minor injuries to all parties involved.

The scene was located near the intersection of Kruunusillat and Syrjäntie on Lehtijalka Street. The primary road, Syrjäntie, was partially blocked due to the aftermath of the accident.

### **Weather and Road Conditions**

The weather conditions at the time of the incident were wet and slippery. Snow had been falling earlier in the day but stopped shortly before the collision. The accumulation on the roads made driving challenging, particularly for drivers relying on visual cues for navigation.

### **Timeline of Events**

1. **Normal Evening Commute:**  
   At approximately 17:00, Maria, a 45-year-old woman from Gothenburg, Sweden, was driving her Saloon (2018 Toyota Camry) along Lehtijalka Street towards the intersection with Kruunusillat. She was traveling at an estimated speed of 65 km/h.

   Laura, a 32-year-old woman from Helsinki, Finland, was driving her货车 (2020 Toyota Crown) on Syrjäntie heading eastbound. She was traveling at approximately 80 km/h.

2. **Approach to the Intersection:**  
   Maria entered the intersection and began to turn left onto Lehtijalka Street. Laura, approaching from the opposite direction, failed to notice Maria's vehicle due to reduced visibility caused by the wet and slippery conditions.

3. **Collision Occurred:**  
   Laura lost control of her货车 as she attempted a sharp left turn on an icy section of Lehtijalka Street. The collision occurred at the center of the intersection, causing both vehicles to spin out of control.

4. **Immediate Stop Due to Hydroplaning:**  
   Maria was unable to stop in time and skid into a large puddle created by the hydroplaning of her Saloon. Laura's货车 also skidded but remained mostly intact due to its four-wheel drive system.

5. **Emergency Services Arrival:**  
   The scene was stabilized after approximately 10 minutes, during which time emergency services assessed both vehicles and the surrounding area for further damage or injuries.

### **Damage Descriptions**

- **Saloon (Maria's Vehicle):**  
  The front-left wheel of Maria's Saloon hydroplaned, creating a large puddle in the center of the road. The vehicle sustained minor front-end damage with visible hydroxylated marks on the front bumper and side mirror.

- **Truck (Laura's Vehicle):**  
  Laura's货车 skidded to a stop at the intersection but retained most of its structural integrity. The truck suffered minimal front-end damage, with the left wheel slightly dented due to the hydroplaning effect.

### **Witness Statements**

1. **Witness 1:**  
   "I was driving on Lehtijalka Street heading east when I heard a sudden swerve from the left. I looked over and saw both vehicles involved in an accident at the center of the intersection."

2. **Witness 2:**  
   "Laura's货车 came to a stop just before the collision, but Maria's Saloon had already hydroplaned into the puddle when she attempted her turn."

### **Conclusion**

The incident was concluded as a result of unavoidable conditions under the wet and slippery road surface. Both drivers were uninjured at the time of reporting, though Laura's货车 sustained minor damage to its left front wheel.

**Next Steps:**  
1. A full investigation into the cause of the collision will be conducted by the Road Traffic Safety Unit.
2. The municipality will collaborate with local authorities to assess the impact of the incident on road maintenance and future traffic safety measures.
