**Incident Report: Traffic Collision in Isokyrö, Finland - March 26, 2025**

**Date:** 26.03.2025  
**Municipality:** Isokyrö  
**Location:** Area of Vantaa Ring Road, near the intersection with Kruunusillat Street  

At approximately 1:45 AM local time, a severe traffic collision occurred involving ten vehicles on the area of Vantaa Ring Road in Isokyrö. The incident was reported by the local ambulance service at 2:05 AM following reports of a multi-vehicle crash with injuries and significant damage to multiple vehicles.

The scene was primarily located near the intersection with Kruunusillat Street, where a large convoy of vehicles had come to a halt due to the collision. The primary road remained closed for subsequent traffic analysis and emergency response teams were on-site to assess the situation.

Weather conditions at the time included clear and sunny skies, with mist forming later in the early hours due to overnight temperatures. Visibility was reduced to approximately 200 meters during the peak of the incident, impacting driver reactions and contributing to the severity of the collision.

The investigation revealed that the accident occurred when a heavy-duty truck traveling westbound on Vantaa Ring Road failed to yield to a group of passenger vehicles attempting to turn left onto Kruunusillat Street. The truck collided with multiple cars, a small bus, and several utility vehicles, all of which sustained partial damage. Fire spread from the vehicle impacted by the initial crash, leading to additional damage to surrounding structures.

The collision resulted in minor injuries reported by two individuals, including a pedestrian who was struck by one of the vehicles. Both individuals were treated on-site and released without serious complications after securing medical attention.

Weather conditions played a significant role in the incident, as reduced visibility due to mist made it difficult for drivers to perceive their surroundings accurately, increasing the likelihood of collision.

The police investigation is ongoing, with a focus on reconstructing the sequence of events leading up to the accident. No immediate arrests have been made, and further action will be determined based on the findings of the investigation team.

**Conclusion:**  
The incident was a complex multi-vehicle collision exacerbated by reduced visibility due to weather conditions. The primary road remains closed for thorough assessment and repair work. Further details regarding the investigation will be provided as they become available.
