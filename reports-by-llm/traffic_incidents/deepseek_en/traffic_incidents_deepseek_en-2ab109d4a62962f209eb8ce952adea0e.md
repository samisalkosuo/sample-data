### Narrative

On the evening commute through Kruunusillat Rautakka junction, driver John Doe (age 48) was traveling on a normal route to work when he encountered weather conditions that affected his visibility. Overcast skies reduced the visibility significantly, impacting his ability to maintain control of his Toyota Camry (ABC 123). As Doe approached the stop sign at Suolajoki Street, he swerved to avoid an obstacle ahead, losing control of his vehicle. The collision occurred with a Suzuki SX4 (XYZ 456), sustaining front-end damage on both vehicles.

Witnesses reported that both drivers were unharmed following the incident. Mr. Kivinen from Nokia City Hall noted the clear signs of impact and estimated the collision to have occurred within a short timeframe after the swerve.
