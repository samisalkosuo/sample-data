### **Incident Description**

On the morning of June 1, 2025, at approximately 07:30 hours, a traffic incident occurred on the outskirts of Ilomantsi, Finland. The collision involved two vehicles and resulted in minor injuries to both parties involved.

The primary driver, **Ms. Anna Maria Kivipelto** (age 42), was traveling northbound on Säilinkatu towards Kumpula Street when she lost control of her Toyota Camry due to icy road conditions.

### **Weather and Road Conditions**

The weather conditions during the incident were dry but cold, with temperatures below freezing. The icy nature of the roads contributed significantly to the accident by reducing visibility and increasing friction between tires and the roadway surface. This made it difficult for drivers to maintain control, especially at low speeds typical in early morning traffic.
