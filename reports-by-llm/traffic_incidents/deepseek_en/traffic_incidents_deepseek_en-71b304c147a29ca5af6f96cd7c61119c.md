**Narrative:**

On the evening of 28 March 2024, a significant traffic incident occurred near the village of Taivassalo in Finland. The scene was located at the intersection of Rautakirjankatu and Syrjälahti, a well-known residential area with tight traffic conditions.

The accident involved two passenger vehicles: a gray sedan (Vehicle A) driven by Mr. Antti Nieminen, age 42, and a dark blue hatchback (Vehicle B) operated by Ms. Salla Kivipelto, age 38. Both drivers were reportedly under the influence of alcohol at the time of the incident.

Witnesses described a dark stretch of road where visibility was severely reduced due to heavy rain, making it impossible for drivers to see approaching vehicles. Mr. Nieminen lost control of Vehicle A while trying to navigate the slippery roads and attempted to swerve to avoid an obstacle on the side of the road. However, the sudden swerve coupled with the low grip on the wet路面 caused the vehicle to lose control entirely.

Ms. Kivipelto, driving Vehicle B, was attempting to merge onto a busy arterial road when she noticed the potential hazard ahead. Instead of decelerating sufficiently or swerving to avoid the obstacle, she failed to react in time, leading her vehicle to collide with the oncoming traffic and subsequently crash into the barrier at the edge of the road.

Both drivers sustained injuries requiring immediate medical attention. Mr. Nieminen suffered minor fractures and was treated at the local hospital, while Ms. Kivipelto incurred more severe injuries, including a broken leg, which required surgical intervention.

The impact of the accident caused significant disruption to the surrounding area, with emergency services and local authorities working tirelessly to manage the aftermath. Authorities are investigating the incident under the suspicion that alcohol played a role in both drivers' decision-making processes.

**Weather and Road Conditions:**

Heavy rain coupled with strong winds created treacherous road conditions throughout the evening. Visibility dropped dramatically, making it challenging for drivers to anticipate obstacles or respond appropriately.
