### **Narrative of the Incident**

At approximately 19:30 local time (6:30 PM), a collision occurred on the outskirts of Kustavi involving three motor vehicles. The primary vehicle involved was a silver Tesla Model S, driven by 28-year-old Tuomas-Pekka "Pekka" Nieminen ("Pekka" is a pseudonym for privacy purposes). Pekka was traveling from his home in Kustavi to visit his parents in the nearby village of Rautakoski. 

The second vehicle involved was a dark blue Toyota Camry, operated by 32-year-old Riikka-Petra "Riikka" Jokipour ("Riikka" is a pseudonym). Riikka was en route to her new job in the neighboring town of Lehtola. The third vehicle, a gray Ford Transit, was driven by 45-year-old Leena-Maria "Leena" Kivipelto ("Leena" is a pseudonym) and was returning from a weekend trip.

The collision occurred on a narrow, winding road leading to the village of Kustavi. Conditions at the time included icy roads, which significantly impacted visibility and posed challenges for drivers. Witnesses reported that both Pekka and Riikka were traveling in opposite directions when they attempted to pass each other on a sharp curve near the collision site.

Pekka lost control of his Tesla due to reduced traction on the icy路面, skidding off onto the snow-covered shoulder. Meanwhile, Leena was driving erratically after losing her brakes as well, leading to a head-on collision with the Camry. The impact ejected Leena from her vehicle, causing injuries. Both Pekka and Riikka sustained minor injuries, including擦伤 and bruises.

### **Weather and Road Conditions**

The incident occurred under icy road conditions, which made driving extremely challenging. Visibility was severely reduced, and drivers struggled to maintain control of their vehicles. Witnesses reported that the roads were so slippery that they could barely see more than a few feet ahead, making it difficult for drivers to anticipate obstacles.

### **Vehicle Damage**

- **Tesla Model S:** The vehicle sustained minor front-end damage, including a scrape on the left bumper and a small crack in the windshield.

### **Witness Statements**

One witness described seeing Pekka and Riikka approaching the curve when they suddenly swerved in opposite directions. "I heard a loud crash," the witness stated. "The driver on the left lost control first, then the Camry went straight into him." Another witness corroborated these accounts, adding that both drivers appeared to be under the influence of alcohol at the time.

### **Conclusion**

The collision appears to have been a high-speed maneuvering incident exacerbated by icy conditions and alcohol consumption. The investigation is ongoing, with a focus on determining the exact cause of the collision and identifying any contributing factors such as driver fatigue or substance abuse.
