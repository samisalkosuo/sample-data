*Municipality: Vesilahti, Finland*

At approximately 19:45 local time, a traffic collision occurred on the intersection of Kruunusillat and Rautakallio Street in Veslahti. The incident involved two motor vehicles, resulting in injuries to one driver.

Weather conditions at the time included windy conditions with gusts reaching up to 20 km/h, which significantly reduced visibility on the roads. Strong winds also contributed to drifting of vehicles along the road edges.

The collision occurred when a small passenger car traveling westbound on Kruunusillat collided with a larger truck heading northbound on Rautakallio Street. The impact was reported to be at a right angle, suggesting that the driver of the car may have lost control or failed to yield properly at the intersection.

The truck sustained moderate damage to its front bumper and side mirror, while the passenger car suffered significant structural damage to its left side. Both vehicles were unable to move immediately after the collision, prompting the nearby Rautakallio Shop to close its doors for safety reasons.

Eyewitness accounts from bystanders near the scene indicated that both drivers were visibly shaken but appeared not to have serious injuries beyond what could be attributed to the collision. A responding ambulance arrived at the scene shortly after the crash and transported the injured driver to a nearby hospital for further evaluation.

Law enforcement officers on scene conducted an immediate investigation, interviewing both drivers and passengers. The truck driver was identified as Olli Kivinen (age 42), who admitted to having been driving under the influence of alcohol. He was arrested on the spot following the incident.

The passenger car driver, identified as Riina Lehto (age 38), was treated for minor injuries and released from the hospital shortly after the collision. She stated that she had not been drinking but was under the influence of fatigue due to a long day at work.

The investigation into the cause of the collision is ongoing, with a focus on determining whether Olli Kivinen's intoxication played a role in his decision-making during the incident. Authorities have seized Olli Kivinen's vehicle and are collaborating with local law enforcement agencies to address the growing concern of alcohol-related road crashes in the area.

This report concludes that the collision was likely exacerbated by the combination of windy weather conditions and the impaired state of one driver, leading to an unavoidable accident at the intersection. Further legal proceedings will be initiated as necessary to hold all parties responsible for their actions accountable.

"I was driving westbound on Kruunusillat when I heard a sudden swerve from behind me. I tried to brake suddenly, but it wasn't enough. The truck drifted into my lane and we hit each other hard. I'm not sure what happened after thatâ€”I think I blacked out for a second."
