### **Incident Overview**

At approximately 1:45 AM, a collision involving two vehicles was reported on "Lakelinnankatu," a quiet residential street in Veteli. The incident occurred during what appeared to be normal evening routines for the drivers involved but quickly escalated into an accident due to unexpected conditions.

### **Weather and Road Conditions**

The night of the incident was marked by snowy weather, with temperatures hovering around -5°C (-23°F). The snowfall had been ongoing since midnight, making visibility extremely low. Night vision was severely impaired, and drivers reported difficulty in detecting other road users due to the reflective nature of snow-covered surfaces.

The roads were covered in a layer of snow that was neither too deep nor articulating yet. This made for treacherous conditions, particularly for vehicles without proper winter tires. Snowdrifts blocked several lanes, complicating emergency response efforts.
