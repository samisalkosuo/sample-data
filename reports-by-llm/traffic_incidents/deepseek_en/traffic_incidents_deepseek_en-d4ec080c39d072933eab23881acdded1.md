**Incident Overview:**

On March 28, 2023, at approximately 14:30 local time, a tragic traffic incident occurred in Kokkola, Finland. The scene involved eight vehicles, including multiple passenger cars and one large 18-wheeler, all of which sustained significant damage. The incident took place on a busy urban road near the city center, where visibility was severely reduced due to wet and slippery road conditions.

**Participants:**

The drivers involved were:

- **Mr. Antti Kivinen (Driver ID: A1B2C3)** - Age: 45
- **Ms. Salla Lehto (Driver ID: D4E5F6)** - Age: 38

Passengers included:

- **Juhani Nieminen** (Age: 29)
- **Elina Kivimaa** (Age: 18)

Other participants on the scene were witnesses and pedestrians, including:

- **Mika Vuorinen**
- **Anna Marttila**

**Timeline of Events:**

1. **Arrival at the Scene:** At 14:25, Mr. Antti Kivinen reported losing control of his 2019 Toyota Camry due to hydroplaning on the wet roads.

2. **Collision with a Pedestrian Vehicle:** The driver lost concentration while navigating traffic lights and struck an older 2016 Honda Civic, sustaineding multiple injuries upon impact.

3. **Chain Reaction Collision:** The Honda Civic then collided with another passenger car (2018 Ford Focus), causing both vehicles to skid further into a third vehicle—a 2020 Suzuki SX4—resulting in a multi-vehicle crash.

4. **Impact on the 18-Wheeler:** The collision cascaded into an 18-wheeler carrying construction materials, leading to a significant spill and blocking the road for emergency vehicles.

5. **Witness Statements:** Witnesses confirmed that the accident occurred during peak hour traffic with reduced visibility due to wet conditions.

**Weather Impact:**

The wet and slippery conditions significantly impacted driving behavior, reducing visibility and increasing reaction times. The combination of alcohol consumption by some drivers and poor road conditions led to unavoidable multi-vehicle collisions.

**Damage Description:**

- **Toyota Camry (Driver's Vehicle):** Front bumper crushed, left wheel well partially demolished.
- **Honda Civic:** Rear end crushed into a tree, front bumper dented.
- **Ford Focus:** Rear collision with the Honda Civic, front grille damaged.
- **Suzuki SX4:** Front impact from the Ford Focus, side impact on the 18-wheeler.
- **18-Wheeler:** Spill of construction materials onto the road, deformation to both sides.

**Conclusion:**

The incident was caused by a combination of driver fatigue due to long drives and alcohol consumption, coupled with wet and slippery road conditions. The multi-vehicle collision resulted in significant injuries and damage across all involved vehicles. Authorities are investigating further into the cause of the accident and will assess any contributing factors beyond driver behavior.
