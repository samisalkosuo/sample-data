*Date: 17 September 2023*  
*Municipality: Pyhäntä, Finland*

At approximately 22:45 local time on the evening of Saturday, 17th September 2023, a traffic incident occurred involving two vehicles in the area of Kruunusillat Yhteisä and Rautakallio. The scene was observed under clear and sunny weather conditions with low light levels due to the setting sun.

The primary vehicle involved was a small passenger car, identified as *A4M-XXL*, registered to driver **Alex Johnson** (32 years old), traveling from Helsinki to Porvoo on route 17. The second vehicle was a medium-sized truck, designated as *B9R-ZXY*, belonging to passenger **Emma Thompson** (28 years old), returning to Helsinki from Oulu via route 45.

Alex Johnson reported that he had just arrived home after completing work duties at the local government office on Kruunusillat Yhteisä. He stated, "I drove carefully through the evening traffic, but something caught my attention near Rautakallio." Emma Thompson mentioned she was leaving her workplace in Oulu and had entered Pyhäntä for a short break before heading home.

As the two drivers approached the intersection on Syrjälahti road, Emma noticed a vehicle ahead of her moving erratically. She attempted to pass, but due to reduced visibility from the setting sun and potential fatigue, she lost control of her vehicle. The truck struck the back bumper of Alex Johnson's car during the collision.

Eyewitness accounts from a nearby resident indicated that both drivers were visibly shaken after the incident. Alex reported hearing a loud crash and damage to his vehicle's bumper, while Emma described seeing the front of the truck damaged beyond recognition.

The scene was captured by local surveillance cameras, which showed the moment of impact with precise timing. Police officers at the scene documented the accident using their handheld flashlights, noting the clear road conditions but challenging visibility due to low light levels.

Both drivers were transported to the nearest hospital for evaluation and treatment under police supervision. The incident is under investigation to determine the exact cause of the collision, which is believed to involve fatigue or distraction on Emma Thompson's part.

This report concludes with the cooperation of all parties involved in the investigation and the provision of assistance to both injured parties during their recovery. Further updates will be provided as necessary.
