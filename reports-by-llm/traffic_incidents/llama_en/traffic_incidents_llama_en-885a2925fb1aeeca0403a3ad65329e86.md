Incident Summary:

On the night of November 14th, 2023, at approximately 23:45 hours, a multi-vehicle collision occurred on Kivikatu in Vaala. The incident involved four vehicles, resulting in damage to all parties and injuries sustained by two individuals.

Narrative:

The scene was illuminated only by flashes of lightning illuminating the dark sky as the storm raged on. Witness, Juhani Lehtonen, a local resident who lives at Kivikatu 10, reported hearing loud crashes and screeching tires around 23:45 hours. He immediately called the emergency services.

Upon arrival, officers found three vehicles involved in the collision: a blue Audi A4 (FH-12321) driven by 32-year-old driver, Antti Salmi, who was traveling from Vaalankoski towards Kivikatu; a silver Toyota Corolla (FK-45678) driven by 28-year-old passenger, Sofia Lindström, and her 7-month-old infant son, Elias. The third vehicle involved was a black Volkswagen Golf (EH-90123), driven by 41-year-old driver, Mika Rissanen.

According to witness statements, Antti Salmi lost control of his Audi A4 while driving on Kivikatu due to the poor visibility caused by heavy rain and strong winds. The vehicle veered off the road and collided with Sofia Lindström's Toyota Corolla, which was traveling in the opposite direction. The impact sent both vehicles spinning out of control.

Mika Rissanen's Volkswagen Golf, which was following behind Antti Salmi's Audi A4, struck the rear end of Sofia Lindström's vehicle after it had already collided with the Audi A4. The force of the collision caused significant damage to all three vehicles.
