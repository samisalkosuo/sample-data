On January 12th, 2024, at approximately 08:45 hours, I responded to a multi-vehicle accident on Mannerheimintie 123 in Savukoski. The incident involved ten vehicles and multiple injuries.

According to witness statements, the accident occurred when driver, Juhani Laaksonen (born 1985), failed to yield to an oncoming vehicle while driving his 2018 Volkswagen Golf (FH4 12345) eastbound on Mannerheimintie. The Golf collided with a 2020 Toyota Corolla (ASL 45678) driven by driver, Sofia Lehtonen (born 1992), who was traveling northbound.

The impact caused both vehicles to swerve into the adjacent lane, where they struck two more vehicles: a 2015 Ford Focus (FH4 90123) driven by driver, Antti Kallio (born 1980), and a 2022 Skoda Octavia (ASL 78901) driven by passenger, Maria Salmi (born 1998). The third vehicle, a 2019 Kia Ceed (FH4 34567), driven by driver, Olli Virtanen (born 1995), was also involved in the accident.

Witnesses reported that the foggy conditions made it difficult to see the road ahead, and several drivers were seen slowing down or stopping suddenly before the collision. The scene was chaotic, with multiple vehicles blocking the road and debris scattered throughout the area.

The injured parties were transported to Savukoski Hospital for treatment. Driver Juhani Laaksonen sustained minor injuries, while passenger Maria Salmi suffered more severe injuries, including a broken arm and concussion. Drivers Sofia Lehtonen, Antti Kallio, and Olli Virtanen were also treated for various injuries.

The accident investigation revealed that driver Juhani Laaksonen had failed to yield to the oncoming vehicle due to distraction caused by his passenger, who was using their phone at the time of the incident. The passenger, identified as driver Sofia Lehtonen's friend, was issued a warning for reckless use of a mobile device.

The road conditions were hazardous due to the foggy weather, with visibility reduced to less than 50 meters in some areas. The accident highlighted the importance of safe driving practices during inclement weather conditions.
