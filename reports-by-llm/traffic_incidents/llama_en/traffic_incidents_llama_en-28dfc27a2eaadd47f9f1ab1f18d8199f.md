"I was driving to work when I saw the accident happen," stated witness, Maria Johansson (35), who lives at nearby address, Kruununhaka 456. "There were four cars involved, and it looked like one of them had run a red light."

According to eyewitness accounts, the incident began when driver, Juhani Lehtonen (42), operating a blue Volkswagen Golf with license plate number FI-12345, failed to stop at the red light at Mannerheimintie 123.
