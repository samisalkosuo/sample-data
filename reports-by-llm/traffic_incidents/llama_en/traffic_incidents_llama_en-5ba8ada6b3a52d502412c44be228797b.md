Date: 11.07.2023
Time of Day: Evening (Night)
Weather Conditions: Foggy

On the evening of July 11th, 2023, at approximately 21:45 hours, officers from the Parkano Police Department responded to a report of a multi-vehicle collision on Mannerheimintie 123 in Parkano. The incident involved five vehicles and resulted in significant damage and injuries.

The scene was found to be hazardous due to the dense fog, which reduced visibility to less than 50 meters. Witnesses reported that the fog made it difficult to see more than a few feet ahead of the vehicles.

According to eyewitness accounts, the collision occurred when driver, Juhani Laaksonen (born 1985), was traveling northbound on Mannerheimintie 123 in his 2018 Volkswagen Golf with license plate number FI-123456. Laaksonen was driving at a speed of approximately 80 km/h when he failed to notice the vehicle ahead, driven by passenger, Sofia Lehtonen (born 1992), who was traveling southbound on Mannerheimintie 123 in her 2015 Toyota Corolla with license plate number FI-987654.

As Laaksonen's Golf approached the intersection with Kivimäentie, he failed to yield to Lehtonen's Corolla and collided with it. The impact caused both vehicles to swerve into oncoming traffic, where they were struck by a third vehicle, driven by driver, Antti Virtanen (born 1980), who was traveling northbound on Mannerheimintie 123 in his 2012 Ford Focus with license plate number FI-111111.

The collision also involved two additional vehicles: a 2020 Skoda Octavia driven by passenger, Emma Lindström (born 1995), which was traveling southbound on Mannerheimintie 123 and had stopped at the intersection due to the accident; and a 2019 Kia Ceed driven by driver, Markus Salmi (born 1988), who was traveling northbound on Kivimäentie and rear-ended Lehtonen's Corolla.

The vehicles involved in the collision were:

* Juhani Laaksonen's 2018 Volkswagen Golf (FI-123456)
* Sofia Lehtonen's 2015 Toyota Corolla (FI-987654)
* Antti Virtanen's 2012 Ford Focus (FI-111111)
* Emma Lindström's 2020 Skoda Octavia (FI-765432)
* Markus Salmi's 2019 Kia Ceed (FI-543210)

The damage to the vehicles was extensive, with multiple crumpled front ends and significant scratches on all sides. The Golf and Corolla sustained the most damage, while the Ford Focus had a broken headlight and rear bumper.

Injuries were reported by Sofia Lehtonen, who suffered minor cuts and bruises. Juhani Laaksonen and Antti Virtanen declined medical attention. Emma Lindström was treated for shock but did not require hospitalization. Markus Salmi also declined medical attention.

The investigation is ongoing, and charges are pending against Juhani Laaksonen for reckless driving and failure to yield. The incident serves as a reminder of the importance of safe driving practices, especially in hazardous weather conditions.
