Incident Report: Vehicle Collision on Highway 16

Date: 15.05.2024
Time of Day: Morning
Location: Ruovesi, Finland (Address: Kivikatu 123, 39600 Ruovesi)

On the morning of May 15th, 2024, at approximately 08:45 hours, I responded to a report of a two-vehicle collision on Highway 16 in Ruovesi. The incident occurred during the early morning rush hour, when the roads were icy due to recent snowmelt.

The vehicles involved were a white Toyota Corolla (License Plate: FNI-123) driven by 32-year-old driver, Antti Lehtonen, and a black Volkswagen Golf (License Plate: KAA-456) driven by 41-year-old driver, Sofia Jensen. Both drivers were traveling in the same direction on Highway 16 when they collided.

According to witness statements, Antti Lehtonen was driving cautiously, slowing down for an approaching school bus that had stopped at a designated stop line. Meanwhile, Sofia Jensen failed to notice the school bus and continued driving at a moderate speed. The Volkswagen Golf struck the Toyota Corolla from behind, causing significant damage to both vehicles.

The scene was chaotic, with both drivers shaken but uninjured. Antti Lehtonen reported feeling a sudden impact and losing control of his vehicle before regaining traction on the icy road. Sofia Jensen claimed she didn't see the school bus until it was too late and slammed on her brakes, causing her vehicle to skid on the ice.

Witnesses described the road conditions as hazardous, with black ice covering large sections of Highway 16. The temperature at the time of the incident was around -2°C, making the roads extremely slippery.

The Toyota Corolla sustained significant damage to its rear bumper and trunk lid, while the Volkswagen Golf suffered damage to its front bumper and hood. Both vehicles were towed from the scene by local towing services.

I conducted a thorough investigation of the scene, speaking with both drivers, witnesses, and reviewing video footage from nearby traffic cameras. The evidence suggests that Sofia Jensen was at fault for failing to notice the school bus, but Antti Lehtonen's cautious driving may have contributed to the severity of the collision.

The incident is currently under review by the Ruovesi Police Department, with further investigation pending.
