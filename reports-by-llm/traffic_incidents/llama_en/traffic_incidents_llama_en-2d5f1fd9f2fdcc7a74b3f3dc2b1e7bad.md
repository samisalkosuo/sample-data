Incident Summary:

On 16th August 2023, at approximately 08:45 hours, a multi-vehicle collision occurred on Kustavi Street in Sottunga Municipality. The incident involved nine vehicles and resulted in significant damage to property and potential injuries.

Narrative of the Incident:

According to witness statements, driver Juhani Lehtonen (born 1985) was driving his 2018 Volkswagen Golf (license plate: FNT-123) northbound on Kustavi Street when he failed to stop at a red light. As he approached the intersection with Pudasjärvi Road, he collided with a vehicle traveling in the opposite direction.

The impact caused Lehtonen's Golf to lose control and collide with three additional vehicles stopped at the red light: a 2015 Toyota Corolla (license plate: FNT-456) driven by passenger Maria Lindström (born 1992), a 2020 Ford Focus (license plate: FNT-789) driven by driver Antti Salmi (born 1988), and a 2012 Skoda Octavia (license plate: FNT-012) driven by passenger Hanna Kallio (born 1995).

The subsequent collision involved Lehtonen's Golf with the rear of the Toyota Corolla, causing significant damage to both vehicles. The Ford Focus was pushed forward, colliding with the front of the Skoda Octavia. The Skoda Octavia then collided with a 2016 Kia Ceed (license plate: FNT-321) driven by driver Petri Mäkelä (born 1982), which had stopped at the red light behind the Toyota Corolla.
