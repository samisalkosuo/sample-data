Summary of Incident:

At approximately 23:45 hours on 26 January 2025, two vehicles collided on Kivimäki Street in Alajärvi. Juhani Lehtonen's Toyota Corolla was traveling northbound on the street when he failed to stop at a red traffic light at the intersection with Linnunmäentie. As he approached the intersection, Sofia Lindström's Volkswagen Golf was already stopped at the red light, waiting to turn right onto Kivimäki Street.

Lehtonen's vehicle struck Lindström's vehicle from behind, causing significant damage to both vehicles. The impact sent Lehtonen's Corolla into a nearby snowbank, while Lindstrom's Golf came to rest against a utility pole on the opposite side of the street.

Marko Miettinen, who was walking home from work at the time of the incident, witnessed the accident and immediately called the emergency services. Anna-Maria Salmi, who was driving by in her own vehicle, stopped to assist and provide information to the responding officers.

Weather Conditions:

The weather on 26 January 2025 was wet and slippery, with a light drizzle falling from the sky. The road surface was covered in a layer of ice, making it difficult for vehicles to maintain traction. Visibility was reduced due to the rain, which made it challenging for drivers to see pedestrians and other vehicles.

Road Conditions:

The road conditions on Kivimäki Street were hazardous due to the wet and slippery surface. The snowbank created by Lehtonen's vehicle added to the challenge, as it blocked a significant portion of the street.

Damage Assessment:

Both vehicles sustained significant damage in the collision. Lehtonen's Toyota Corolla suffered damage to its rear bumper, side panels, and windshield. Lindström's Volkswagen Golf had damage to its front bumper, hood, and passenger-side door.

Injuries:

Neither driver was injured in the accident, but both vehicles were rendered inoperable due to the extent of the damage.

Investigation:

The investigation is ongoing, and further details will be provided once all evidence has been collected and analyzed.
