Time of Day: Morning
Location: Kruununhaka, 00100 Porvoo, Finland

On the morning of June 22nd, 2023, at approximately 08:45 hours, I responded to a report of a traffic collision on Kruununhaka Street in Porvoo. Upon arrival, I observed two vehicles involved in the incident.

The first vehicle, a white Volkswagen Golf ( registration number FI-123456) driven by Mr. Antti Lehtonen, was traveling northbound on Kruunanrinne Street when it failed to yield to traffic on Kruununhaka Street. The second vehicle, a silver Skoda Octavia (registration number FI-987654) driven by Ms. Sofia Jensen, was traveling eastbound on Kruununhaka Street and was attempting to turn left onto Kruunanrinne Street.

According to witness statements, Mr. Lehtonen's Volkswagen Golf struck the rear bumper of Ms. Jensen's Skoda Octavia as she attempted to make the turn. The impact caused significant damage to both vehicles.

Witnesses reported that the weather conditions at the time were light rain, with visibility reduced to approximately 50 meters. The road surface was wet and slippery due to the rain, which contributed to the severity of the collision.

The timeline of events is as follows:

* 08:40 hours: Ms. Sofia Jensen's Skoda Octavia arrives on Kruunanrinne Street.
* 08:42 hours: Mr. Antti Lehtonen's Volkswagen Golf approaches the intersection from Kruunanrinne Street.
* 08:43 hours: Ms. Jensen attempts to turn left onto Kruunanrinne Street, while Mr. Lehtonen fails to yield to traffic on Kruununhaka Street.
* 08:45 hours: The collision occurs between the two vehicles.

Damage assessment:

* Mr. Lehtonen's Volkswagen Golf sustained significant damage to its rear bumper and wheel wells.
* Ms. Jensen's Skoda Octavia suffered damage to its rear bumper, wheel wells, and a small dent on the driver's side door.

Injuries were reported none. Both drivers and passengers were shaken but uninjured.

I conducted interviews with both drivers and witnesses, as well as inspected the vehicles involved in the incident. The investigation is ongoing, and further details will be provided once all evidence has been collected and analyzed.
