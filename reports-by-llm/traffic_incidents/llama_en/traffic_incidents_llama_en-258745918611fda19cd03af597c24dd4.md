Incident Report: Rautalampi Municipality, Finland - January 30, 2023

Date: January 30, 2023
Time of Day: Morning
Weather Conditions: Snowy

Location: Kivikatu 12, Rautalampi

On January 30, 2023, at approximately 08:45 hours, I, Officer Juhani Laaksonen (Badge Number: 1234), responded to a report of a two-vehicle collision on Kivikatu in Rautalampi. Upon arrival, I observed that the incident had occurred on a snowy road surface.

The vehicles involved were a white Toyota Corolla (License Plate: FNT-456) driven by Ms. Sofia Lehtonen, and a black Volkswagen Golf (License Plate: HSL-789) driven by Mr. Antti Kallio. Both drivers were wearing seatbelts at the time of the incident.

According to witness statements from Mr. Pekka Rissanen, who was walking his dog on the sidewalk nearby, Ms. Lehtonen's Toyota Corolla was traveling northbound on Kivikatu when it failed to stop at a red traffic light. The vehicle then collided with the Volkswagen Golf, which was stopped at the intersection waiting for the light to change.

The impact caused significant damage to both vehicles. The front bumper of the Toyota Corolla was severely damaged, while the front fender and hood of the Volkswagen Golf were also damaged. There were no reports of injuries or fatalities.

Witnesses reported that the road surface was slippery due to the snowfall, which may have contributed to Ms. Lehtonen's failure to stop at the red light. The speed limit on Kivikatu is 50 km/h, and both drivers were traveling within the posted limits at the time of the incident.

The investigation is ongoing, but preliminary findings suggest that driver error was the primary cause of the collision. Further analysis will be conducted to determine the exact circumstances surrounding the incident.

Signed,
