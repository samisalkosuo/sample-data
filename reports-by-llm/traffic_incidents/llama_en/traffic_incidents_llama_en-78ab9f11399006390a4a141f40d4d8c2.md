Summary of Incident:

At approximately 08:45, a multi-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kivikatu and Euranpolku in Eura Municipality. The incident involved four vehicles, resulting in damage to all parties involved.

According to eyewitness accounts, Vehicle 1 (Volkswagen Golf) driven by Juhani Laaksonen was traveling northbound on Kivikatu when it failed to yield to traffic approaching from the east on Euranpolku. Vehicle 2 (Ford Focus) driven by Leena Kärkkäinen attempted to merge onto Kivikatu, but was unable to clear the intersection in time.

As a result, Vehicle 1 collided with Vehicle 3 (Toyota Corolla) driven by Antti Siltanen, which was traveling eastbound on Euranpolku. The impact caused both vehicles to swerve into the adjacent lane, where they collided with Vehicle 4 (Skoda Octavia) driven by Maria Lindström.

Witnesses reported that the rain-soaked road surface contributed to the accident, as reduced visibility and slippery conditions made it difficult for drivers to maintain control of their vehicles. The light rain also caused the roads to become increasingly wet, leading to a higher risk of hydroplaning.
