Date: 03.01.2023
Time of Day: Evening (18:00-20:00)
Weather Conditions: Wet and Slippery

On January 3rd, 2023, at approximately 19:45 hours, I responded to a report of an accident on Riihimäenkatu 12 in Riihimäki. Upon arrival, I observed two vehicles involved in the incident.

The first vehicle, a white Volkswagen Golf ( registration number FI-123456) driven by 32-year-old driver, Antti Lehtonen, was traveling northbound on Riihimäenkatu when it lost control due to excessive speed and slippery road conditions. The vehicle crossed over into the southbound lane and collided with a blue Skoda Octavia (registration number FI-987654) driven by 41-year-old driver, Sari Puhakka.

The impact occurred at approximately 19:47 hours, causing significant damage to both vehicles. Antti Lehtonen's Volkswagen Golf sustained front-end damage, including a crushed bumper and damaged headlights. The Skoda Octavia suffered rear-end damage, with a broken tailgate and dented trunk lid.

Passengers in the Skoda Octavia, 25-year-old driver, Juhani Rissanen, and his 30-year-old passenger, Maria Lindström, were shaken but uninjured. Antti Lehtonen's passenger, 28-year-old driver, Emma Salmi, was also uninjured.

Witnesses reported that the accident occurred when Antti Lehtonen failed to slow down for a red traffic light at the intersection of Riihimäenkatu and Kivikatu. The Skoda Octavia was traveling in the opposite direction and had the right-of-way.

The road conditions were hazardous due to heavy rain and oil slicks on the pavement, which contributed to Antti Lehtonen's loss of control. The accident scene was secured, and both drivers were issued a warning for reckless driving.

The investigation is ongoing, but it appears that excessive speed and failure to slow down at a red traffic light were contributing factors to the accident.
