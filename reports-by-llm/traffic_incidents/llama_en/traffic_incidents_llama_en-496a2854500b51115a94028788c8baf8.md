Summary of Incident:

At approximately 10:45 AM on January 9th, 2025, a multi-vehicle collision occurred on Mannerheimintie in Loimaa. The incident involved six vehicles, resulting in significant damage and injuries.

According to witness statements, Vehicle 1 (Volkswagen Golf) driven by Juhani Laaksonen was traveling northbound on Mannerheimintie when it failed to yield to traffic from the east. Vehicle 2 (Ford Focus) driven by Leena Kallio was approaching the intersection from the east and attempted to merge onto Mannerheimintie. The collision occurred when Vehicle 1 struck Vehicle 2, causing both vehicles to swerve into oncoming traffic.

Vehicle 3 (Toyota Corolla) driven by Antti Siltanen, who was traveling behind Vehicle 1, slammed on his brakes to avoid the collision but lost control of his vehicle. Vehicle 4 (Honda Civic) driven by Sofia Lindström, who was following Vehicle 3, also skidded on the wet pavement and crashed into Vehicle 5 (Skoda Octavia) driven by Markus Rissanen.

Vehicle 6 (Subaru Impreza) driven by Emma Järvinen, who was traveling behind Vehicle 4, failed to stop in time and rear-ended Vehicle 1. The impact caused both vehicles to spin out of control, resulting in a chain reaction of collisions.

Weather Conditions:

The weather on the day of the incident was clear and sunny with a temperature of approximately 5°C. The road surface was dry, but the pavement had been recently resurfaced, making it slippery in some areas.

Road Conditions:

Mannerheimintie was closed to traffic for approximately two hours while the scene was processed and vehicles were towed away. The road conditions were hazardous due to the wet pavement and debris from the collisions.

Injuries and Damage:

All six drivers reported minor injuries, including bruises and scratches. No serious injuries or fatalities were reported. Vehicle damage ranged from minor scratches to significant dents and crumpled metal.

Investigation:

The investigation is ongoing, but preliminary findings suggest that driver error was a contributing factor to the incident. The police are reviewing dashcam footage and conducting interviews with witnesses and drivers involved in the incident.
