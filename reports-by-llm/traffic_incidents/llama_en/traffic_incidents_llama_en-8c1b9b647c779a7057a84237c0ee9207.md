Date: 04.11.2024
Time of Day: Morning
Location: Tuusniemi, Finland (Tuusniemenkatu 12)

On November 4th, 2024, at approximately 08:45 hours, I responded to a report of a two-vehicle collision on Tuusniemenkatu in Tuusniemi. Upon arrival, I observed both vehicles involved, with damage consistent with a rear-end collision.

The drivers involved were identified as:

* Driver A: Juhani Laaksonen (male, 35 years old), registered owner of the vehicle
* Driver B: Sofia Lehtonen (female, 28 years old)

Both drivers were wearing seatbelts at the time of the incident. There were no reported injuries to either driver.

Witnesses present included:

* Witness 1: Marko Salmi (male, 42 years old), who stated he was walking his dog on Tuusniemenkatu when he observed the collision.
* Witness 2: Anna-Maria Kallio (female, 25 years old), who was driving behind Driver A's vehicle and reported seeing the incident.

The vehicles involved were:

* Vehicle A: A Toyota Corolla (2018 model) with license plate number AKL-123, driven by Juhani Laaksonen.
* Vehicle B: A Volkswagen Golf (2020 model) with license plate number EHK-456, driven by Sofia Lehtonen.

The collision occurred when Driver A's vehicle was traveling northbound on Tuusniemenkatu and failed to stop at the intersection with Tuusniemenranta. As a result, Vehicle B, which was traveling eastbound from the opposite direction, struck Vehicle A's rear bumper.

Weather conditions at the time of the incident were overcast, with light drizzle and visibility of approximately 100 meters. The road surface was wet, but not slippery.

The scene was processed, and photographs were taken of both vehicles and the surrounding area. Damage to Vehicle A included a crushed rear bumper and minor scratches on the rear quarter panel. Vehicle B sustained damage to its front bumper and a small dent on the driver's side door.

Both drivers cooperated fully with the investigation and provided statements regarding the incident. The cause of the collision is currently under investigation, but preliminary findings suggest that Driver A failed to stop at the intersection due to distraction or inattention.
