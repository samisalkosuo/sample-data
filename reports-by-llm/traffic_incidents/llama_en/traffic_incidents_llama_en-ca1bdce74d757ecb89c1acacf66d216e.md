Summary of Incident:

At approximately 21:45 on 21.05.2023, a multi-vehicle collision occurred on Kivijärven katu in Kivijärvi, Finland. The incident involved nine vehicles, including the above-mentioned vehicles.

According to witness statements and vehicle inspection reports, the sequence of events was as follows:

At approximately 21:40, Vehicle 1 (Volkswagen Golf) driven by Juhani Lehtonen was traveling northbound on Kivijärven katu. As he approached the intersection with Kivijärven tie 12, he failed to yield to traffic from the east and collided with Vehicle 2 (Toyota Corolla) driven by Maria Lindström.
