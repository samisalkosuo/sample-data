Incident Details:

On the morning of June 3rd, 2023, at approximately 08:45 hours, I responded to a report of a two-vehicle collision on Väyläntie 12 in Kaskinen. Upon arrival, I met with the involved parties and witnesses.

The vehicles involved were a blue Toyota Corolla (license plate: AKS-123) driven by 32-year-old driver, Antti Lehtonen, and a white Volkswagen Golf (license plate: KAS-456) driven by 28-year-old driver, Sofia Jensen. Both drivers were traveling in the same direction on Väyläntie 12 when the collision occurred.

According to witness statements, Antti Lehtonen was driving cautiously, but failed to notice the Volkswagen Golf, which had slowed down due to light rain conditions. The impact occurred at approximately 08:47 hours, causing significant damage to both vehicles.

Witnesses reported that Sofia Jensen's vehicle skidded on the wet road before colliding with Antti Lehtonen's Toyota Corolla. The force of the impact caused both vehicles to stop on the side of the road.

Weather Conditions:

The weather on the morning of June 3rd, 2023, was characterized by light rain with visibility reduced to approximately 100 meters. The road surface was wet and slippery, contributing to the skidding incident.

Road Conditions:

Väyläntie 12 was reported to be in good condition, but the presence of water on the road made it hazardous for drivers. The side street where Sofia Jensen attempted to turn left was poorly lit and had a history of accidents due to inadequate signage.
