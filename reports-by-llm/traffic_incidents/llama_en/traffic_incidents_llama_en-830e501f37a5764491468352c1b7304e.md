Incident Report: 25.11.2024, Karijoki Municipality

Date: 25 November 2024
Time of Day: Morning
Location: Street Kivimäki 12, Karijoki

On the morning of 25 November 2024, at approximately 08:45 hours, I responded to a report of a two-vehicle collision on Street Kivimäki 12 in Karijoki. Upon arrival, I observed that both vehicles had sustained significant damage and were parked on the side of the road.

The drivers involved were identified as:

* Driver A: Juhani Lehtonen, age 32, from Karijoki
* Driver B: Sofia Lindström, age 28, from Espoo

Both drivers were wearing seatbelts at the time of the incident. There were no reported injuries to either driver.

Witnesses present at the scene included:

* Witness 1: Marko Mäkelä, age 45, who lives nearby and witnessed the collision
* Witness 2: Anna-Maria Salmi, age 38, who was driving by and stopped to assist

According to witness accounts, Driver A's vehicle, a 2018 Toyota Corolla with license plate number AKL-123, was traveling northbound on Street Kivimäki 12 when it failed to stop at the intersection with Street Rantamäki. Driver B's vehicle, a 2020 Volkswagen Golf with license plate number ESD-456, was traveling southbound and attempted to yield to Driver A's vehicle.

As Driver A's vehicle approached the intersection, it lost traction on the wet and slippery road surface, causing it to skid and collide with Driver B's vehicle. The impact occurred at approximately 08:46 hours.

The collision caused significant damage to both vehicles. Driver A's Toyota Corolla sustained a crushed front bumper and a damaged side mirror, while Driver B's Volkswagen Golf had a dented rear bumper and a cracked windshield.

Road conditions at the time of the incident were wet and slippery, with a layer of ice forming on the road surface. The temperature was around 2°C, and there was light drizzle falling from the sky.

The investigation is ongoing, but preliminary findings suggest that Driver A's vehicle may have been traveling at an excessive speed for the conditions, contributing to the loss of traction and subsequent collision.
