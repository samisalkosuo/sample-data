Summary:

On the night of April 3rd, 2023, at approximately 23:45 hours, a three-vehicle collision occurred on Mannerheimintie in Keminmaa, Finland. The incident involved vehicles with license plates FI-123456 and FI-987654, as well as a pedestrian.

Narrative:

The driver of the vehicle with license plate FI-123456, 32-year-old Marko Laaksonen from Rovaniemi, was traveling northbound on Mannerheimintie when he failed to notice the pedestrian, 28-year-old Sofia Lehtonen, who was walking in the opposite direction. The pedestrian was wearing a reflective vest and had been warned by local authorities about the hazardous road conditions due to fog.

Laaksonen's vehicle collided with Sofia's bicycle, causing significant damage to both vehicles. The impact sent Sofia's bicycle flying into the path of the second vehicle, a 45-year-old driver named Juhani Kärkkäinen from Oulu, who was traveling southbound on Mannerheimintie.

Kärkkäinen's vehicle, a 2018 Toyota Camry with license plate FI-987654, suffered significant front-end damage. The impact also caused Sofia to fall and hit her head on the pavement. She was transported to the local hospital for treatment.

Witnesses reported that the third vehicle, a 38-year-old driver named Antti Virtanen from Helsinki, who was traveling southbound on Mannerheimintie in the opposite direction, swerved to avoid the collision but lost control of his 2015 Volkswagen Golf. The vehicle skidded on the wet pavement and came to a stop near the scene.
