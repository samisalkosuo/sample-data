Summary of Incident:

Narrative of Incident:

The scene was illuminated by the headlights of the vehicles involved, which were traveling northbound on Kivikatu 12 towards the town center. Witness Juhani Lehtonen, a local resident who lives at 10 Kivikatu 12, reported hearing a loud crash and seeing several vehicles stop on the road.

According to witness testimony, driver Antti Luukkainen (born 1985) was driving his 2018 Volkswagen Golf (license plate: FJK-123) northbound when he failed to yield to an approaching vehicle. The Golf collided with a 2020 Toyota Corolla (license plate: EHK-456) driven by driver Sofia Jensen (born 1992). The impact sent both vehicles into the snow-covered median, where they came to rest.

As the drivers attempted to assess the damage and exchange information, another vehicle, a 2015 Ford Focus (license plate: KKL-789) driven by driver Markus Rissanen (born 1988), lost control on the snowy road and crashed into the rear of the Corolla. The Focus then collided with a 2022 Skoda Octavia (license plate: TKA-321) driven by driver Leena Salmi (born 1995).

Meanwhile, a fourth vehicle, a 2019 Honda Civic (license plate: HJK-654), driven by driver Elias Kallio (born 1991), failed to stop in time and rear-ended the Octavia. The Civic then collided with a fifth vehicle, a 2020 Hyundai Elantra (license plate: EHK-901), driven by driver Emma Lindström (born 1994).

The final two vehicles involved were a 2017 Kia Ceed (license plate: KKL-234) driven by driver Oskari Laaksonen (born 1985) and a 2020 Nissan Sentra (license plate: NKA-567) driven by driver Anna-Maria Söderström (born 1993). Both vehicles stopped on the road, but not before colliding with each other.
