Incident Report: Traffic Collision

Date: 03.09.2024
Time of Day: Evening
Location: Ylivieska, Finland (Kirkkotie 12)

On the evening of September 3rd, 2024, at approximately 20:45 hours, I responded to a report of a traffic collision on Kirkkotie in Ylivieska. Upon arrival, I observed two vehicles involved in the incident.

The first vehicle, a white Volkswagen Golf ( registration number FI-123456) driven by 32-year-old driver, Antti Lehtonen, was traveling northbound on Kirkkotie when it lost control due to reduced visibility caused by heavy rain and strong winds. The vehicle crossed over into the southbound lane and collided with a blue Skoda Octavia (registration number FI-987654) driven by 41-year-old driver, Sofia Jensen.

The Skoda Octavia was traveling in the same direction as Antti Lehtonen's Volkswagen Golf when it struck the rear of the Volkswagen. The impact caused significant damage to both vehicles, including crushed front bumper and hood on the Volkswagen Golf, and a damaged rear bumper on the Skoda Octavia.

Passengers in both vehicles were shaken but uninjured. Antti Lehtonen reported that he had been driving for approximately 30 minutes before losing control of his vehicle. Sofia Jensen stated that she was not aware of the approaching vehicle until it was too late.

Witnesses, including a pedestrian, Juhani Rissanen (age 55), who was walking home from work at the time of the incident, reported that the weather conditions were hazardous, with heavy rain and strong winds making it difficult to see or hear anything. The road surface was wet and slippery, contributing to the loss of control by both drivers.

The investigation revealed that Antti Lehtonen had been driving recklessly in the preceding hours, speeding on rural roads before entering the urban area. Sofia Jensen, on the other hand, reported that she had been following safe driving practices throughout her journey.

Both vehicles were towed from the scene and transported to a nearby repair shop for assessment. The incident is currently under investigation, with further details pending review of evidence and witness statements.
