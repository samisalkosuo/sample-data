Injuries:

Neither driver reported any injuries. However, both drivers were shaken by the incident and required medical attention.

Conclusion:

The investigation concluded that Mr. Antti Lehtonen was at fault for failing to stop at the intersection. The collision occurred due to a combination of factors, including reduced visibility caused by light rain and inadequate following distances.

Recommendations:

* Both drivers should attend traffic safety courses to improve their defensive driving skills.
