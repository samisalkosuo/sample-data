Summary of Incident:

At approximately 08:45 hours on February 4th, 2025, a multi-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kivikatu and Väyläntie in Kurikka. The incident involved seven vehicles, including two passenger cars, three commercial vehicles, and two motorcycles.

According to witness statements, Vehicle 1 (Volkswagen Golf) driven by Juhani Laaksonen was traveling northbound on Kivikatu when it failed to stop at the intersection due to a momentary lapse in attention. As a result, Vehicle 2 (Ford Focus) driven by Leena Rissanen collided with Vehicle 3 (Toyota Corolla) driven by Mikael Lindström.

The impact caused both vehicles to swerve into oncoming traffic, where they collided with Vehicles 4 (Honda Civic), 5 (BMW 3 Series), and 6 (Subaru Impreza). The resulting chain reaction also involved Vehicle 7 (Citroen C4) driven by Markus Ranta, which was traveling in the opposite direction.

Emergency services were dispatched to the scene at approximately 08:50 hours. Firefighters and paramedics arrived on the scene within five minutes, where they found all seven vehicles involved in the collision. No fatalities or serious injuries were reported.
