On the evening of November 24th, 2024, at approximately 20:45 hours, a multi-vehicle traffic accident occurred on Korvenkylänkatu in Raahe. The incident involved nine vehicles and resulted in significant damage to property.

The driver of the first vehicle, a white Volkswagen Passat with license plate number AKL 123, was identified as 32-year-old Juhani Laaksonen from Oulu. Laaksonen was traveling northbound on Korvenkylänkatu when he failed to stop at a red traffic light at the intersection of Korvenkylänkatu and Rantamiehkuja.

As Laaksonen's vehicle approached the intersection, it collided with a black Ford Focus driven by 28-year-old Sofia Lindström from Espoo. The impact caused both vehicles to swerve into oncoming traffic lanes. A white Toyota Corolla with license plate number HSL 456, driven by 41-year-old Marko Salmi from Helsinki, was unable to avoid the collision and struck the Ford Focus.

The subsequent chain reaction involved a silver BMW 3 Series (license plate number KTL 789) driven by 35-year-old Emma Järvinen from Turku, which collided with a blue Honda Civic (license plate number EKA 321) driven by 29-year-old Antti Virtanen from Kuopio. The Honda Civic then struck a red Nissan Sentra (license plate number NKL 654) driven by 38-year-old Leena Kallio from Jyväskylä.

As the vehicles continued to collide, a white Skoda Octavia (license plate number OHL 901) driven by 42-year-old Petri Mikkonen from Tampere became involved in the accident. The Skoda Octavia struck a black Volkswagen Golf (license plate number GKL 234) driven by 25-year-old Elias Lehtinen from Seinäjoki.

The final vehicle to become involved was a silver Audi A4 (license plate number AUD 567) driven by 39-year-old Sari Puhakka from Savo. The Audi A4 collided with the Skoda Octavia, causing significant damage to both vehicles.

Witnesses reported that the foggy weather conditions significantly reduced visibility on Korvenkylänkatu at the time of the accident. The road surface was wet and slippery due to the fog, which contributed to the severity of the incident.

The timeline of events is as follows:

* 20:45 hours: Juhani Laaksonen fails to stop at a red traffic light on Korvenkylänkatu.
* 20:45 hours (approx.): Laaksonen's Volkswagen Passat collides with Sofia Lindström's Ford Focus.
* 20:46 hours (approx.): The white Toyota Corolla strikes the Ford Focus, causing further damage.

* 20:49 hours (approx.): Petri Mikkonen's Skoda Octavia collides with Sari Puhakka's Audi A4.
