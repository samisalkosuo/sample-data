Time of Day: Night
Location: Kivimäki Street, 48300 Alavus

On the night of April 12th, 2024, at approximately 23:45 hours, officers responded to a report of a three-vehicle collision on Kivimäki Street in Alavus. The incident occurred during a period of dense fog, which significantly reduced visibility.

The vehicles involved were:

1. A white Volkswagen Golf ( registration number: ALAVUS-1234) driven by 32-year-old driver, Antti Lehtonen.
2. A silver Ford Focus (registration number: ALAVUS-5678) driven by 41-year-old driver, Sofia Jensen.
3. A black Toyota Corolla (registration number: ALAVUS-9012) driven by 29-year-old driver, Juhani Rautio.

According to witness statements and vehicle inspection, the incident occurred when Antti Lehtonen's Volkswagen Golf failed to yield to Sofia Jensen's Ford Focus as it approached a pedestrian crossing on Kivimäki Street. The impact caused both vehicles to veer off the road, striking a parked car (a blue Honda Civic, registration number: ALAVUS-3456) located adjacent to the crossing.

The Toyota Corolla, driven by Juhani Rautio, was traveling in the opposite direction on Kivimäki Street and collided with the Volkswagen Golf as it swerved into the road. The impact caused significant damage to both vehicles, including crushed front ends and shattered windshields.

Witnesses reported that the foggy conditions made it difficult for drivers to see each other's vehicles, leading to a chain reaction of collisions. One witness, 35-year-old local resident, Maria Lindström, stated: "I was walking home from work when I saw the cars swerve into each other. It was like they were invisible."

The scene was secured by officers at approximately 00:15 hours, and all parties involved were treated for minor injuries. Antti Lehtonen was issued a warning for failing to yield to oncoming traffic.

Vehicle damage assessments revealed:

* Volkswagen Golf (ALAVUS-1234): Front end crushed, windshield shattered
* Ford Focus (ALAVUS-5678): Front bumper damaged, side mirror cracked
* Toyota Corolla (ALAVUS-9012): Front end crushed, hood dented
* Honda Civic (ALAVUS-3456): Minor scratches and dents

Weather conditions at the time of the incident were characterized by dense fog with visibility of less than 100 meters. Road surface was wet due to previous precipitation.

This report concludes that the three-vehicle collision on Kivimäki Street in Alavus was caused by a combination of factors, including inadequate visibility due to fog and Antti Lehtonen's failure to yield to oncoming traffic.
