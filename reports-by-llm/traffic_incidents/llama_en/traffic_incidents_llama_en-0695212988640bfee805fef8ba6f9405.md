On the morning of May 23, 2023, at approximately 08:45 hours, officers from Lieto Police Department responded to a multi-vehicle collision on Mannerheimintie 123 in Lieto. The incident involved six vehicles and resulted in minor injuries.

According to witness statements, the accident occurred when driver Juhani Laaksonen (born February 12, 1985) of Espoo failed to yield to an oncoming vehicle while driving northbound on Mannerheimintie 123. Laaksonen's vehicle, a white Toyota Corolla with license plate number AKL-456, collided head-on with the vehicle driven by driver Leena Kärkkäinen (born October 25, 1992) of Turku.

Kärkkäinen's vehicle, a silver Volkswagen Golf with license plate number TUR-789, sustained significant damage to its front bumper and hood. Laaksonen's Corolla suffered minor scratches on the passenger side door.

Witnesses reported that Kärkkäinen's vehicle was traveling at a moderate speed when it collided with Laaksonen's Corolla. The impact caused both vehicles to swerve onto the shoulder, where they came to rest.

Passengers in both vehicles were shaken but uninjured. Kärkkäinen's passenger, driver Antti Salmi (born August 15, 1990), was treated for minor whiplash at the scene. Laaksonen's passenger, driver Sofia Lindström (born January 10, 1988), declined medical attention.

Other vehicles involved in the incident included a blue Ford Focus driven by driver Markus Mäkelä (born June 20, 1995) of Lieto, which sustained minor scratches on its rear bumper. A green Honda Civic driven by driver Erika Lehtinen (born March 25, 1982) of Helsinki was stopped at the scene with its hazard lights activated due to a flat tire.

A black BMW 3 Series driven by driver Olli Virtanen (born November 12, 1998) of Espoo was traveling behind Kärkkäinen's vehicle and slowed down to avoid the collision. A white Audi A4 driven by driver Hanna Lappalainen (born April 15, 1985) of Turku was stopped at a nearby intersection due to poor visibility.

The road conditions were dry but cold, with a layer of frost covering the asphalt. The surface was smooth, and there were no signs of inclement weather or debris on the scene.

Investigation is ongoing, and charges are pending against Laaksonen for reckless driving. All parties involved have been notified, and they will be required to attend a traffic safety seminar as part of their penalty.
