Incident Report: Traffic Accident on Viitasaari Street

Date: 02.11.2023
Time of Day: Morning
Location: Viitasaari, Finland (Address: Kruununhaka 12, 60100 Jyväskylä)

On the morning of November 2nd, 2023, at approximately 08:45 hours, I responded to a report of a traffic accident involving five vehicles on Viitasaari Street in Jyväskylä. Upon arrival, I observed that the accident had occurred near the intersection with Kruununhaka Street.

The vehicles involved were:

1. A blue Volkswagen Golf (License Plate: FJK-123) driven by 32-year-old driver, Antti Lehtonen.
2. A silver Toyota Corolla (License Plate: EHK-456) driven by 28-year-old driver, Sofia Lindström.
3. A black Ford Focus (License Plate: TKA-789) driven by 41-year-old driver, Juhani Kärkkäinen.
4. A white Honda Civic (License Plate: HSL-012) driven by 25-year-old driver, Elias Tuomisto.
5. A red Kia Sportage (License Plate: KIA-345) driven by 35-year-old driver, Maria Salmi.

The accident occurred when Antti Lehtonen's Volkswagen Golf collided with Sofia Lindström's Toyota Corolla while both vehicles were traveling northbound on Viitasaari Street. The impact caused both vehicles to swerve into the adjacent lane, where they struck Juhani Kärkkäinen's Ford Focus and Elias Tuomisto's Honda Civic.

Maria Salmi's Kia Sportage, which was following behind Lehtonen's Volkswagen Golf, rear-ended the red sedan that had been involved in the initial collision. The Kia Sportage sustained significant damage to its rear bumper and trunk lid.

Witnesses reported that the weather conditions at the time of the accident were heavy rain with visibility reduced to approximately 50 meters. The road surface was wet and slippery, contributing to the loss of traction by all vehicles involved.

The timeline of events is as follows:

* 08:45 hours: Antti Lehtonen's Volkswagen Golf collides with Sofia Lindström's Toyota Corolla.
* 08:46 hours: Both vehicles swerve into the adjacent lane and strike Juhani Kärkkäinen's Ford Focus and Elias Tuomisto's Honda Civic.
* 08:47 hours: Maria Salmi's Kia Sportage rear-ends the red sedan that had been involved in the initial collision.

All drivers were shaken but uninjured. The accident was caused by Lehtonen's failure to maintain a safe following distance, exacerbated by the hazardous road conditions.

The scene was processed and evidence collected. All vehicles were towed from the scene for further inspection and repair.
