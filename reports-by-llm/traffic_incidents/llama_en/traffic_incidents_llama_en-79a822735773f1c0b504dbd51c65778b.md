On the morning of August 21st, 2024, at approximately 06:45, a traffic collision occurred on Kivimäki Street in Ikaalinen Municipality. The incident involved seven vehicles and resulted in significant damage and injuries.

Narrative:

The incident began when driver, Juhani Laaksonen (D-12345), was traveling northbound on Kivimäki Street in his 2018 Volkswagen Golf, license plate number FI-123456. Laaksonen was driving at a speed of approximately 60 km/h when he failed to notice the vehicle ahead, driven by passenger, Maria Lehtinen (P-98765), who was traveling southbound on Kivimäki Street in her 2015 Toyota Corolla.

As Laaksonen's Golf approached the intersection with Mannerheim Street, he lost control of his vehicle and collided with a third vehicle, driven by driver, Antti Salmi (D-54321), who was traveling eastbound on Mannerheim Street in his 2020 Ford Focus. The impact caused both vehicles to swerve into the adjacent lane, where they collided with two more vehicles: a 2012 Skoda Octavia driven by driver, Hanna Virtanen (D-11111), and a 2019 Honda Civic driven by passenger, Tommi Kivimäki (P-22222).

The fourth vehicle involved in the incident was a 2016 Kia Ceed driven by driver, Pekka Rissanen (D-44444), who was traveling northbound on Kivimäki Street. The Kia collided with the rear of the Volkswagen Golf.

Witnesses reported that the foggy conditions and reduced visibility contributed to the severity of the incident. "It was like driving through a cloud," said witness, Eeva-Liisa Mäkelä (P-98765), who was traveling southbound on Kivimäki Street at the time of the incident.
