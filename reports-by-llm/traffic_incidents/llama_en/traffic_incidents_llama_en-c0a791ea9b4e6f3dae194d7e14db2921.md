Date: 03.12.2024
Time of Day: Morning
Location: Kivikatu, 40100 Nokia, Finland

On December 3rd, 2024, at approximately 08:45 hours, I responded to a report of a two-vehicle collision on Kivikatu Street in the municipality of Nokia, Finland. The incident occurred during the morning rush hour.

The vehicles involved were a white Volkswagen Golf (license plate number AKL 123) driven by Mr. Antti Lehtonen, and a black Toyota Corolla (license plate number EHU 456) driven by Ms. Sofia Jensen. Both drivers were traveling in the same direction on Kivikatu Street when the collision occurred.

According to witness statements, the Volkswagen Golf was traveling at a moderate speed when it failed to stop at the intersection of Kivikatu and Kaarina Streets. The Toyota Corolla, which was turning left onto Kivikatu from Kaarina, collided with the Volkswagen Golf. The impact caused significant damage to both vehicles.

The driver of the Volkswagen Golf, Mr. Lehtonen, reported that he had not seen the approaching vehicle due to the heavy rain and snow on the road. He stated that he was trying to navigate through a flooded area when the collision occurred.

Ms. Jensen, the driver of the Toyota Corolla, reported that she had slowed down to turn left onto Kivikatu but did not have time to stop before colliding with the Volkswagen Golf.

Witnesses present at the scene included Mr. Juhani Rissanen, who was walking his dog on Kaarina Street when he saw the collision occur. He stated that it looked like both drivers were trying to avoid the other vehicle.

The weather conditions at the time of the incident were mixed snow and rain, with visibility reduced due to heavy precipitation. The road surface was slippery, and both vehicles skidded on the wet pavement before coming to a stop.

Upon arrival, I observed significant damage to both vehicles. The Volkswagen Golf had a crushed front bumper and a cracked windshield, while the Toyota Corolla had a dented hood and a broken headlight. Both drivers were shaken but uninjured.

I conducted interviews with both drivers and witnesses, and collected evidence from the scene, including photographs of the damaged vehicles and witness statements. I also reviewed traffic camera footage from nearby intersections to determine the sequence of events leading up to the collision.

The investigation is ongoing, and further analysis will be conducted to determine the cause of the incident.
