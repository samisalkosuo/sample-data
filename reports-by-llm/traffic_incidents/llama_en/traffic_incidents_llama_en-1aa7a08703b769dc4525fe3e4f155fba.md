Incident Summary:

On the evening of December 3rd, 2024, at approximately 20:15, a multi-vehicle collision occurred on Kylmäntie in Pihtipudas. The incident involved five vehicles and resulted in significant damage to property.

Narrative:

According to eyewitness accounts, driver Juhani Lehtonen (born 1985) was traveling northbound on Kylmäntie when his vehicle, a white Toyota Corolla with license plate number FI-123456, lost control due to the slippery road conditions. The car skidded off the road and collided with a parked vehicle, a silver Ford Focus owned by passenger Maria Lindström (born 1992).

Witnesss Marianna Rissanen (born 1988) reported that she was walking home from work when she saw Lehtonen's car lose control. "I heard a loud screeching sound and saw the car spin out of control," she stated.

The impact caused Lehtonen's vehicle to collide with another car, a black Volkswagen Golf driven by driver Antti Salmi (born 1979). The Golf was traveling southbound on Kylmäntie. Salmi's passenger, driver Sofia Jensen (born 1995), suffered minor injuries.

As the scene unfolded, two more vehicles became involved in the incident. A blue Honda Civic driven by driver Eero Mikkonen (born 1980) collided with Lehtonen's vehicle while attempting to pass. The Civic was traveling northbound on Kylmäntie. Mikkonen reported that he had not seen Lehtonen's car and did not intend to collide.

The final vehicle involved in the incident was a red Skoda Octavia driven by driver Olli Lappi (born 1991). Lappi was traveling southbound on Kylmäntie when his vehicle collided with Salmi's Volkswagen Golf. The impact caused significant damage to both vehicles.
