Summary:

On December 7th, 2023, at approximately 08:45 AM, a multi-vehicle collision occurred on Kemiöntie in Inari Municipality, resulting in damage to several vehicles and minor injuries to two passengers. The incident involved 11 vehicles, including a school bus, a taxi, and nine private cars.

Narrative:

The accident began when driver, Juhani Lehtonen (born 1985), was driving his 2018 Volkswagen Golf (license plate: FNI-123) northbound on Kemiöntie. As he approached the intersection with Rovaniemenkatu, he failed to yield to an oncoming school bus driven by driver, Maria Salmi (born 1972). The bus, a Volvo B7R (license plate: INI-456), was traveling eastbound and had its hazard lights activated.

As the Golf collided with the front of the bus, it veered off the road and struck a parked taxi, driven by driver, Antti Kallio (born 1988). The taxi, a Toyota Prius (license plate: INI-789), was parked on the side of the road. The impact caused significant damage to both vehicles.

Passengers in the Golf, including Lehtonen's wife, Sofia Lehtonen (born 1990), and their two children, Elias Lehtonen (born 2015) and Aino Lehtonen (born 2018), were shaken but uninjured. The bus passengers, including driver Salmi and her assistant, driver Jari Välimaa (born 1969), were also uninjured.

Witnesses reported that the rain was light, with visibility of approximately 100 meters. Road conditions were wet, with a layer of water covering the surface of Kemiöntie.
