Incident Report: Accident on Rusko Road 12, February 19, 2024

Date: February 19, 2024
Time of Day: Morning
Location: Rusko Municipality, Finland (Address: 1234 Rusko Road 12)

On the morning of February 19, 2024, at approximately 08:45 hours, I responded to a report of a multi-vehicle accident on Rusko Road 12. Upon arrival, I observed five vehicles involved in the incident.

The vehicles involved were:

1. A blue Volkswagen Golf (License Plate: FNI-123) driven by Juhani Laaksonen, a 35-year-old resident of Rusko.
2. A white Toyota Corolla (License Plate: KAI-456) driven by Maria Lehtonen, a 28-year-old student from the local university.
3. A black Ford Focus (License Plate: TAP-789) driven by Antti Salmi, a 42-year-old businessman.
4. A silver Honda Civic (License Plate: LOP-012) driven by Sofia Jensen, a 25-year-old tourist from Denmark.
5. A red Skoda Octavia (License Plate: FIN-901) driven by Jari V채limaa, a 50-year-old retired teacher.

The accident occurred when the Volkswagen Golf driven by Juhani Laaksonen lost control on the wet and icy road surface due to the mixed snow and rain conditions. The vehicle crossed over into the opposite lane, colliding with the Toyota Corolla driven by Maria Lehtonen. The impact caused both vehicles to swerve off the road, striking a parked car (a gray Nissan Qashqai, License Plate: NIS-234) and a utility pole.

Witnesses reported that Juhani Laaksonen's vehicle was traveling at a high speed before losing control. Maria Lehtonen's vehicle sustained significant damage to its front bumper and hood. Antti Salmi's vehicle suffered minor scratches on the rear bumper, while Sofia Jensen's vehicle had no visible damage. Jari V채limaa's vehicle was not involved in the accident.

The weather conditions at the time of the incident were mixed snow and rain, with visibility reduced to approximately 100 meters due to heavy snowfall. The road surface was slippery, making it difficult for drivers to maintain control of their vehicles.

* 08:45 hours: Juhani Laaksonen's Volkswagen Golf loses control on Rusko Road 12.
