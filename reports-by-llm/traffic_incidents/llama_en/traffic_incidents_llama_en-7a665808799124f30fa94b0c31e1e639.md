Summary of Incident:

At approximately 20:15 on 12.04.2025, a traffic collision occurred on Kivikatu in Uurainen. The incident involved three vehicles: Vehicle 1 (Volkswagen Golf), Vehicle 2 (Ford Focus), and Vehicle 3 (Skoda Octavia).

According to witness statements, the sequence of events was as follows:

* At around 20:15, Vehicle 1 was traveling northbound on Kivikatu towards the intersection with Rantakatu.
* As Vehicle 1 approached the intersection, it failed to yield to traffic from the right and collided with Vehicle 2, which was turning left onto Kivikatu.
* The impact caused Vehicle 2 to lose control and collide with Vehicle 3, which was parked on the side of the road.

The drivers and passengers of all three vehicles were shaken but uninjured. The Volkswagen Golf sustained significant damage to its front bumper and hood, while the Ford Focus had minor scratches on its rear bumper. The Skoda Octavia had no visible damage.

Witness Petri Miettinen reported that he was walking home from work when he saw the collision occur. "I heard a loud bang and saw all three vehicles involved," he stated. "It looked like Vehicle 1 didn't see Vehicle 2 turning onto the road."

Witness Anna-Maria Lindström, who lives nearby, also witnessed the incident. "I was getting out of my car when I saw the collision happen," she said. "The drivers were all shaken but seemed okay. The police arrived quickly and took statements from everyone involved."

Investigation:

The investigation is ongoing, but preliminary findings suggest that Vehicle 1 driver Juhani Laaksonen may have been distracted or not paying attention to the road conditions due to the foggy weather.

Road Conditions:

Kivikatu was reported to be slippery and poorly lit due to the foggy weather. The intersection with Rantakatu had a history of accidents, but this incident appears to be an isolated event.

Recommendations:

* Vehicle 1 driver Juhani Laaksonen is advised to attend a defensive driving course to improve his awareness of road conditions.
* All drivers involved are reminded to exercise caution when driving in foggy weather and to use their headlights to increase visibility.
* The municipality is advised to consider improving the lighting at the intersection with Rantakatu.
