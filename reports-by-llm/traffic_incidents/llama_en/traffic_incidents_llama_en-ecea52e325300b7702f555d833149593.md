Incident Report: Vehicle Collision on Raisio Street

Date: 01.03.2024
Time of Day: Morning
Location: Raisio, Finland (Address: Kivikatu 12, 21500 Raisio)

On the morning of March 1st, 2024, at approximately 08:45 hours, I responded to a report of a vehicle collision on Kivikatu in Raisio. Upon arrival, I observed two vehicles involved in the incident.

The first vehicle, a white Volkswagen Golf (License Plate: FNI-123), was traveling northbound on Kivikatu when it failed to yield to the second vehicle. The second vehicle, a blue Opel Astra (License Plate: OPE-456), was proceeding eastbound on Kivikatu.

According to witness statements, the Volkswagen Golf driver, 32-year-old Antti Lehtonen from Raisio, lost control of his vehicle due to reduced visibility caused by foggy weather conditions. The Opel Astra driver, 28-year-old Sofia Lindström from Espoo, attempted to avoid the collision but was unable to do so in time.

The Volkswagen Golf collided with a parked car (a silver Ford Focus, License Plate: FOR-789) on the north side of Kivikatu at approximately 08:46 hours. The impact caused significant damage to both vehicles, including crushed front bumper and hood of the Volkswagen Golf, and a dented rear bumper of the Opel Astra.

Witnesses reported that Antti Lehtonen was shaken but uninjured in the incident. Sofia Lindström also appeared unharmed. Both drivers were cooperative with the investigation and provided statements to the police.

The foggy weather conditions on Kivikatu made it difficult for drivers to see pedestrians, other vehicles, or road signs. The reduced visibility caused by the fog contributed to the severity of the collision.

This incident highlights the importance of driving safely in adverse weather conditions. The foggy weather on Kivikatu reduced visibility, making it difficult for drivers to react in time. Both drivers demonstrated good judgment and cooperation during the investigation.
