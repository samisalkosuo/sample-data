Date: 05.04.2025
Time of Day: Evening (Night)
Location: Mannerheimintie, Helsinki, Finland
Weather Conditions: Overcast with Light Rain

On the evening of April 5th, 2025, at approximately 21:45 hours, officers from the Helsinki Police Department responded to a report of a multi-vehicle collision on Mannerheimintie. The incident involved six vehicles and resulted in significant damage and injuries.

The scene was located near the intersection with Esplanadinkatu, where the vehicles had collided while traveling northbound on Mannerheimintie. Witnesses reported that the vehicles were traveling at a moderate speed when they suddenly stopped due to reduced visibility caused by the overcast weather conditions and light rain.

According to eyewitness accounts, driver Juhani Laaksonen (born 1985) of Helsinki was driving his 2018 Volkswagen Golf (license plate: FJK-123) northbound on Mannerheimintie when he failed to stop at a red traffic light. The vehicle struck the rear end of a 2020 Toyota Corolla (license plate: KKL-456) driven by passenger, Maria Lehtonen (born 1992).

The impact caused both vehicles to swerve into the adjacent lane, where they collided with two more vehicles: a 2015 Ford Focus (license plate: TTT-789) driven by driver, Antti Salmi (born 1980), and a 2022 Skoda Octavia (license plate: OOO-111) driven by passenger, Sofia Jensen (born 1998). The third vehicle involved was a 2019 Kia Ceed (license plate: KKK-222) driven by driver, Leena Rissanen (born 1985).

The collision resulted in significant damage to all six vehicles. Driver Juhani Laaksonen and passenger Maria Lehtonen were transported to the Helsinki University Hospital for treatment of non-life-threatening injuries.

Witnesses reported that the vehicles involved were traveling at a moderate speed, approximately 50 km/h, when they collided. The road surface was wet due to the light rain, which contributed to the reduced visibility.

The investigation is ongoing, and officers are reviewing dashcam footage from nearby vehicles to determine the cause of the collision. Further analysis will be conducted to determine fault and assign liability.
