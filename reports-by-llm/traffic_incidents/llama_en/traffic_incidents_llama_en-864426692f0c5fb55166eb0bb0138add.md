At approximately 08:45 hours, I, Officer Juhani Rantanen (Badge Number: 1234), responded to a report of a multi-vehicle collision on Kymenkatu 12 in Parikkala. Upon arrival, I observed that the incident involved eleven vehicles, with multiple injuries reported.

According to witness statements, the accident occurred when driver, Jari Välimaa (age 42, from Kuopio), failed to yield to an approaching vehicle while traveling northbound on Kymenkatu 12. Välimaa's vehicle, a white Toyota Corolla (license plate: FJK-123), collided with a blue Volkswagen Golf (license plate: HSL-456) driven by driver, Sofia Lehtonen (age 28, from Helsinki). The impact caused both vehicles to veer off the road and collide with several other vehicles parked along the side of Kymenkatu 12.
