Investigator's Notes:

On the morning of May 9th, 2023, at approximately 10:45 AM, I responded to a report of a vehicle collision on Yliopistokatu 12 in Rovaniemi, Keminmaa. Upon arrival, I observed two vehicles involved in the incident.

Narrative:

The driver of a white Toyota Corolla (license plate: FI-123456) was traveling northbound on Yliopistokatu 12 when he failed to yield to an oncoming vehicle. The driver of a black Volkswagen Golf (license plate: FI-789012) was traveling southbound in the same direction.

According to witness statements, the Toyota Corolla driver, Mr. Antti Lehtonen (age 32), lost control of his vehicle and crossed into the opposite lane, colliding with the Volkswagen Golf driven by Ms. Sofia Jensen (age 28). The impact occurred on the eastern side of Yliopistokatu 12, approximately 50 meters from the intersection with Merikatu.

The Toyota Corolla sustained significant damage to its front bumper and hood, while the Volkswagen Golf suffered minor scratches on its rear bumper. Both drivers and passengers were shaken but uninjured.

Witnesses reported that the weather conditions at the time of the incident were overcast with light drizzle, reducing visibility to approximately 100 meters. The road surface was wet, making it slippery for both vehicles.
