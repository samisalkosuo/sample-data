Incident Summary:

On the evening of February 7th, 2023, at approximately 21:15 hours, a multi-vehicle collision occurred on Kivikatu in Hyvinkää. The incident involved four vehicles and resulted in damage to all parties.

Narrative:

The scene was investigated by Officer Juhani Rantanen (Badge Number: 1234). Upon arrival, it was observed that the vehicles were parked along both sides of Kivikatu, approximately 50 meters apart from each other. The drivers involved were identified as:

1. Driver A: Petri Laaksonen, age 32, from Espoo
2. Driver B: Sofia Lindström, age 29, from Helsinki
3. Driver C: Juhani Virtanen, age 41, from Vantaa
4. Passenger D: Emma Kivimäki, age 17, from Hyvinkää

Witnesses reported that the vehicles were stationary when Officer Rantanen arrived on the scene. However, upon closer inspection, it was determined that Driver A's vehicle (a silver 2018 Toyota Corolla with license plate number AKL-123) had been involved in a minor fender bender earlier in the evening.

Timeline of Events:

* 20:45 hours: Driver A's vehicle collided with an unattended bicycle parked along Kivikatu.
* 21:00 hours: Driver B's vehicle (a black 2020 Volkswagen Golf with license plate number HSL-456) arrived on the scene, and Driver A attempted to park in a vacant parking space adjacent to Driver B's vehicle.
* 21:05 hours: Driver C's vehicle (a blue 2015 Ford Focus with license plate number TYO-789) pulled into the parking lot, and Driver A accidentally backed into Driver C's vehicle while attempting to maneuver.
* 21:10 hours: Passenger D was in Driver B's vehicle when it collided with Driver A's vehicle.

Weather Conditions:

The wind gusts caused minor damage to all vehicles involved. The strong winds also made it difficult for Officer Rantanen to secure the scene, and debris from the incident scattered across the parking lot.

Damage Description:

* Driver A's Toyota Corolla sustained minor scratches on the driver's side door and bumper.
* Driver B's Volkswagen Golf had a small dent on the rear passenger-side door.
* Driver C's Ford Focus had a scratch on the front bumper and a cracked windshield.
* Passenger D's seat was damaged, with a torn fabric covering.

Officer Rantanen concluded that the incident was caused by a combination of factors, including driver error, inadequate parking space management, and adverse weather conditions. All parties involved were issued warnings for reckless driving and failure to exercise caution in inclement weather.
