Weather Conditions: Foggy

On the morning of May 10th, 2025, at approximately 08:45 hours, I responded to a multi-vehicle collision on Mannerheimintie 123 in Rovaniemi. The incident involved eight vehicles and resulted in significant damage and injuries.

The scene was found to be chaotic, with debris scattered across the road and surrounding sidewalks. Witnesses reported that the accident occurred when driver, Juhani Lehtonen (born 1985), lost control of his vehicle, a white Toyota Corolla (license plate: FNI-123), while traveling northbound on Mannerheimintie.

According to eyewitness accounts, Lehtonen's vehicle crossed over into the southbound lane and collided with a black Volkswagen Passat (license plate: KOR-456) driven by passenger, Sofia Jensen (born 1992). The impact sent both vehicles careening into nearby parked cars, including a silver Honda Civic (license plate: HON-789) owned by witness, Antti Luukkainen (born 1980).

As the scene unfolded, it became apparent that Lehtonen's vehicle had also struck a red Ford Focus (license plate: FOR-901), driven by passenger, Maria Rodriguez (born 1995). The collision sent both vehicles into a nearby snowbank, where they came to rest.

Witnesses reported hearing a loud screeching sound and seeing the vehicles collide. "It was like a domino effect," said Luukkainen. "One minute everything was fine, and the next, cars were crashing everywhere."

Emergency services arrived on scene shortly after 09:00 hours, where they found Lehtonen and Jensen shaken but uninjured. Rodriguez and her passenger, driver, Tommi Kallio (born 1988), were also uninjured.

The vehicles involved in the incident are as follows:

* Toyota Corolla (white) - FNI-123
* Volkswagen Passat (black) - KOR-456
* Honda Civic (silver) - HON-789
* Ford Focus (red) - FOR-901

Damage to the vehicles is extensive, with multiple dents and scratches reported. The Toyota Corolla suffered significant damage to its front bumper and hood.

The road conditions at the time of the incident were hazardous due to heavy fog, which reduced visibility to less than 100 meters. The fog was so thick that it made it difficult for witnesses to see more than a few feet in front of them.

The investigation is ongoing, but preliminary findings suggest that Lehtonen's loss of control was likely caused by his failure to adjust to the hazardous road conditions. Charges are pending and will be determined at a later date.
