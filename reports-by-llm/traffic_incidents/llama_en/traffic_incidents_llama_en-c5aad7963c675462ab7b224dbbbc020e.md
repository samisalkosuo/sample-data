Summary of Incident:

On July 8th, 2024, at approximately 10:45 AM, a multi-vehicle collision occurred on Kustviksgatan in Föglö Municipality. The incident involved ten vehicles, resulting in significant damage and injuries.

Narrative of Incident:

The incident began when driver, Juhani Lehtonen, was traveling northbound on Kustviksgatan in his 2018 Volkswagen Golf (license plate: FI-123456). As he approached the intersection with Linnunranta, he failed to yield to an oncoming vehicle.

Sofia's vehicle collided with Juhani's Golf, causing significant damage to both vehicles. The impact sent Juhani's Golf careening into a nearby parked car, driven by witness, Markus Lindström, which was located at Kustviksgatan 12.

As the vehicles continued to move, they struck several other cars parked along the street, including a 2015 Ford Focus (license plate: FI-111111) driven by passenger, Emma Svensson, and a 2012 Skoda Octavia (license plate: FI-222222) driven by driver, Henriksson.

The vehicles then continued to move down the street, striking several more cars, including a 2020 Kia Sportage (license plate: FI-333333) driven by passenger, Alexander Pettersson, and a 2018 Honda Civic (license plate: FI-444444) driven by driver, Lena Andersson.

The vehicles eventually came to a stop at the intersection with Linnunranta, where they blocked traffic in both directions. Emergency services were quickly dispatched to the scene.
