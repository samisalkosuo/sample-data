Incident Report: Traffic Collision

Date: 29.09.2023
Time of Day: Evening
Location: Käkkönenkatu 12, Utsjoki

On the evening of September 29th, 2023, at approximately 21:45 hours, I responded to a report of a traffic collision on Käkkönenkatu in Utsjoki. Upon arrival, I observed two vehicles involved in the incident.

The first vehicle, a white Toyota Corolla with Finnish registration plate "KJF-123", was traveling northbound on Käkkönenkatu when it failed to stop at the intersection with Vuovankatu. The driver, 32-year-old Juhani Lehtonen from Rovaniemi, lost control of the vehicle and collided with a second vehicle, a silver Volkswagen Golf with Finnish registration plate "KJF-456".

The second vehicle was traveling eastbound on Käkkönenkatu when it was struck by the Toyota Corolla. The driver, 28-year-old Sofia Lindström from Helsinki, sustained minor injuries.

Witnesses reported that the weather conditions at the time of the incident were light rain, with visibility reduced to approximately 50 meters. The road surface was wet and slippery due to the rain, which contributed to the loss of control by the Toyota Corolla's driver.

The Volkswagen Golf suffered significant damage to its front bumper and hood, while the Toyota Corolla sustained damage to its front fender and side mirror. Both vehicles were towed from the scene by local towing services.

Juhani Lehtonen was administered a breathalyzer test at the scene, which revealed a blood alcohol concentration of 0.05%. He was subsequently issued a warning for reckless driving and released on the spot.

Sofia Lindström was transported to a nearby medical facility for treatment of her minor injuries. She was later discharged after receiving basic care and advice.

The investigation is ongoing, but preliminary findings suggest that the incident was caused by Juhani Lehtonen's failure to stop at the intersection and his subsequent loss of control due to excessive speed and impaired vision.
