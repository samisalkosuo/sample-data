Summary of Incident:

On the evening of February 6th, 2025, at approximately 21:45 hours, two vehicles collided on Kivikatu in Lieto. The incident involved a blue Volkswagen Golf (license plate: FNT-123) driven by 32-year-old driver, Antti Laaksonen, and a silver Ford Focus (license plate: EAS-456) driven by 28-year-old driver, Sofia Lehtinen.

According to witness statements, both vehicles were traveling in the same direction on Kivikatu when the Volkswagen Golf failed to yield to the Ford Focus. The Ford Focus was attempting to merge onto the main road from a side street when it was struck by the Volkswagen Golf. The impact caused significant damage to both vehicles.
