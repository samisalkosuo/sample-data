Date: 24 August 2023
Time: Night (23:00 - 01:00)
Location: Kivikatu, Toivakka, Finland

Summary:

On the night of 24 August 2023, at approximately 23:45 hours, two vehicles collided on Kivikatu in Toivakka. The incident resulted in damage to both vehicles and minor injuries to one passenger.

Narrative:

The driver of a white Volkswagen Golf (FK 123 AB) was traveling northbound on Kivikatu when he failed to yield to an approaching vehicle. The Golf collided with a silver Skoda Octavia (DK 456 EF), which was traveling eastbound on the same street.

Passenger, 35-year-old Juhani Lehtonen, was injured in the collision and received minor injuries at the scene. He was transported to Toivakka Hospital for further treatment.

The driver of the Volkswagen Golf, 28-year-old Antti Salmi, reported that he had not seen the approaching vehicle due to a combination of factors, including darkness and a faulty headlight. The driver of the Skoda Octavia, 42-year-old Marja-Liisa Kallio, stated that she had been traveling cautiously and had slowed down before entering the intersection.

Witnesses reported that both vehicles were traveling at moderate speeds when the collision occurred. The road surface was dry but cold, with a temperature of approximately -5°C at the time of the incident.

Timeline:

* 23:45 hours: Antti Salmi's Volkswagen Golf approaches the intersection of Kivikatu and Toivakka Street.
* 23:46 hours: Marja-Liisa Kallio's Skoda Octavia enters the intersection from the eastbound direction.
* 23:47 hours: The two vehicles collide, resulting in damage to both vehicles.
* 23:48 hours: Juhani Lehtonen is injured and transported to Toivakka Hospital.

Weather Conditions:

The weather conditions at the time of the incident were dry but cold. A temperature of approximately -5°C was recorded, with a wind speed of 10 km/h from the north.

Road Conditions:

The road surface was dry, but the cold temperatures had caused the asphalt to become brittle and prone to cracking. The intersection where the collision occurred had been recently resurfaced, but the new material had not yet fully set, resulting in some minor unevenness.

Vehicle Damage:

* Antti Salmi's Volkswagen Golf sustained significant damage to its front bumper and headlight.
* Marja-Liisa Kallio's Skoda Octavia suffered damage to its front fender and wheel well.

Investigation:

The investigation is ongoing. Further analysis of the vehicles' black boxes and witness statements will be conducted in the coming days.
