1. Vehicle 1: A white Volkswagen Golf ( registration number: FJK-123) driven by Juhani Lehtonen, a 35-year-old resident of Kurikka.
2. Vehicle 2: A silver Skoda Octavia (registration number: EHK-456) driven by Maria Lindström, a 28-year-old student from Turku.

Witnesses:

2. Sanna Rissanen, a 29-year-old nurse at Kurikka Hospital, who was driving by and stopped to assist.

Summary of Incident:

At approximately 08:45 hours, Petri Mäkelä reported a traffic collision on Kivikatu between two vehicles. Upon arrival, officers found that Vehicle 1 had collided with Vehicle 2 while traveling in the opposite direction. The impact occurred near the intersection of Kivikatu and Pajamiehenkuja.

Timeline of Events:

08:40 hours: Juhani Lehtonen was driving his Volkswagen Golf northbound on Kivikatu, approaching the intersection with Pajamiehenkuja.
08:42 hours: Maria Lindström was driving her Skoda Octavia southbound on Kivikatu, also approaching the intersection with Pajamiehenkuja.
08:43 hours: Lehtonen failed to yield to traffic in the opposite direction and collided with Lindström's vehicle.
08:44 hours: The impact caused both vehicles to stop. Lehtonen exited his vehicle to assess the damage, while Lindström remained inside her vehicle.

Weather Conditions:

At the time of the incident, a thunderstorm was ongoing in Kurikka, with heavy rain and strong winds. Visibility was reduced due to the storm, making it difficult for drivers to see pedestrians or other vehicles.

Road Conditions:

The road surface was wet and slippery due to the rain, which contributed to the loss of traction by both vehicles. The intersection of Kivikatu and Pajamiehenkuja had a history of congestion during morning rush hour, adding to the complexity of the incident.

Damage Assessment:

Vehicle 1 (Volkswagen Golf): Lehtonen reported minor damage to his vehicle's front bumper and hood. The impact was relatively low-speed, with estimated speeds at the time of collision ranging from 30-40 km/h.
Vehicle 2 (Skoda Octavia): Lindström reported significant damage to her vehicle's front bumper, side panel, and windshield. The impact was also relatively low-speed, but the stormy weather may have contributed to increased stress on the vehicle's structure.

Injuries:

Neither driver sustained any serious injuries during the incident. However, Maria Lindström reported minor scratches and bruises from being thrown forward in her seatbelt.

Investigation:

The investigation is ongoing, with officers reviewing dashcam footage and conducting interviews with witnesses and drivers involved. The cause of the collision remains under investigation, but preliminary findings suggest that Lehtonen's failure to yield to traffic in the opposite direction was a contributing factor.
