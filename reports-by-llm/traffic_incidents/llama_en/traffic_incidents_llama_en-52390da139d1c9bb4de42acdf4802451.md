Incident Summary:

On September 9th, 2023, at approximately 08:45 AM, a multi-vehicle collision occurred on Kruunan puistokatu in Nurmes. The incident involved seven vehicles and resulted in significant damage to property and potential injuries.

Narrative of the Incident:

The accident began when driver, Juhani Laaksonen (born 1985), was traveling northbound on Kruunan puistokatu in his 2018 Volkswagen Golf with license plate number FI-123456. Laaksonen was driving at a speed of approximately 60 km/h when he failed to notice the icy road conditions and lost control of his vehicle, drifting into the center lane.

As Laaksonen struggled to regain control, he collided with a 2015 Toyota Corolla driven by passenger, Maria Lehtonen (born 1992), who was traveling southbound on Kruunan puistokatu. The impact caused Lehtonen's vehicle to spin out of control and collide with a parked car, a 2012 Ford Focus owned by witness, Antti Salmi (born 1975).

Meanwhile, Laaksonen's Volkswagen Golf continued to slide across the road, striking a 2020 Skoda Octavia driven by driver, Sofia Jensen (born 1998), who was traveling northbound on Kruunan puistokatu. The impact caused Jensen's vehicle to swerve into the opposite lane, where it collided with a 2016 Kia Ceed driven by passenger, Elias Lindström (born 2001).

As the vehicles continued to collide and spin out of control, they struck a 2014 Honda Civic driven by driver, Emma Eriksson (born 1995), who was traveling southbound on Kruunan puistokatu. The impact caused Eriksson's vehicle to lose traction and slide into a snowbank.

The final collision occurred when Laaksonen's Volkswagen Golf struck a 2019 Hyundai Elantra driven by driver, Oskari Rantanen (born 1990), who was traveling northbound on Kruunan puistokatu. The impact caused Rantanen's vehicle to spin out of control and collide with the parked Ford Focus.

Witness Statement:

Antti Salmi, who witnessed the incident, stated: "I was walking my dog when I saw Laaksonen's vehicle drift into the center lane. I immediately ran to the scene to warn others, but it was too late. The vehicles were moving so fast that they couldn't stop in time."
