Investigator's Notes:

On the morning of March 13th, 2025, at approximately 08:45 hours, I responded to a report of a multi-vehicle collision on Kyrkogatan 12 in Sottunga. Upon arrival, I observed four vehicles involved in the incident.

Narrative:

The driver of a silver 2018 Volkswagen Golf (license plate: FI-123456) was traveling northbound on Kyrkogatan when he failed to yield to traffic from the east. A white 2020 Toyota Corolla (license plate: FI-789012), driven by passenger, Ms. Sofia Lindström, was turning left onto Kyrkogatan from a side street. The Golf collided with the Corolla, causing significant damage to both vehicles.

The driver of the Golf, Mr. Juhani Lehtonen, reported that he had not seen the Corolla due to his own distraction while using his phone. Ms. Lindström and her passenger, Mr. Antti Salmi, were shaken but uninjured.

A black 2015 Ford Focus (license plate: FI-345678) was stopped at a red light nearby when it was rear-ended by a blue 2022 Skoda Octavia (license plate: FI-901234). The driver of the Octavia, Ms. Maria Rissanen, reported that she had not seen the Focus due to her own inattention.

Witnesses reported that the road conditions were dry but slippery due to the cold weather, and that visibility was good despite the early morning hour.
