Summary:

On the evening of October 7th, 2024, at approximately 20:45, a traffic incident occurred on Kivikatu in Toholampi, Finland. The incident involved three vehicles, resulting in damage to two of them.

Narrative:

The incident began when driver, Juhani Laaksonen (born 1985), was driving his 2018 Volkswagen Golf, license plate FI-12345, northbound on Kivikatu towards the city center. Laaksonen was traveling at a moderate speed when he failed to notice the vehicle in front of him, driven by passenger, Sofia Lehtonen (born 1992). Lehtonen's 2015 Toyota Corolla, license plate FI-67890, was traveling southbound on Kivikatu.

As Laaksonen approached the intersection with Kaarina Street, he failed to yield to Lehtonen's vehicle and collided with it. The impact caused both vehicles to swerve off the road, coming to a stop near the sidewalk.

Witnesses reported that the stormy weather conditions made it difficult for drivers to see each other, and the heavy rain reduced visibility to almost zero. The strong winds also caused trees to sway violently in the area, making it even more challenging for drivers to maintain control of their vehicles.

Passenger, Antti Virtanen (born 1988), who was riding shotgun with Lehtonen, sustained minor injuries from the collision and was treated at the scene by emergency responders. Laaksonen's passenger, Emma Lindström (born 1995), was not injured in the incident.

Damage Assessment:

Laaksonen's Volkswagen Golf suffered significant damage to its front bumper and hood, with a total estimated cost of €2,500. Lehtonen's Toyota Corolla sustained minor scratches on its rear bumper, with an estimated repair cost of €1,000.

The third vehicle involved in the incident was a 2020 Ford Focus, driven by witness, Markus Rissanen (born 1983). The Ford Focus suffered no significant damage and was able to continue driving without issue.
