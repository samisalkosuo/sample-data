On the night of July 22nd, 2023, at approximately 23:45 hours, a traffic collision occurred on Kivimäenkatu in Laihia.

According to eyewitnesses, the incident began when Juhani Laaksonen's Volkswagen Golf was traveling northbound on Kivimäenkatu.

The impact caused both vehicles to veer off the road, where they collided with Antti Kärkkäinen's Ford Focus, which was parked on the side of the road. The occupants of all three vehicles were shaken but uninjured.

Witnesses reported that the storm intensified during the incident, causing visibility to be severely reduced. The strong winds also caused debris to scatter across the road, making it difficult for emergency responders to access the scene.
