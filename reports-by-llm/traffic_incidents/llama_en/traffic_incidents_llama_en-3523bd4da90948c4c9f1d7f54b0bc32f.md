Incident Report: Vehicle Collision on Kärkölä Street 12

Date: January 10, 2024

Location: Kärkölä, Finland (Kärkölä Street 12)

Time of Incident: Nighttime (23:45 hours)

Weather Conditions: Overcast with light drizzle

Investigator's Notes:

On January 10, 2024, at approximately 23:45 hours, I responded to a report of a vehicle collision on Kärkölä Street 12 in Kärkölä, Finland. Upon arrival, I observed two vehicles involved in the incident.

Narrative of Events:

The driver of the first vehicle, 35-year-old Marko Salmi (license plate: FJK-123), was traveling northbound on Kärkölä Street 12 when he failed to yield to the second vehicle, a 28-year-old passenger car driven by Sofia Lindström (license plate: GHI-456). The passenger car was traveling eastbound on Kärkölä Street 12.

According to witnesses, including 25-year-old witness Juhani Lehtinen, who was walking home from work at the time of the incident, Marko Salmi's vehicle crossed over into the opposite lane and collided with Sofia Lindström's vehicle. The impact occurred on a slight incline near the intersection with Kärkölä Street 11.

Timeline of Events:

* 23:40 hours: Marko Salmi's vehicle is seen traveling northbound on Kärkölä Street 12.
* 23:42 hours: Sofia Lindström's vehicle is seen traveling eastbound on Kärkölä Street 12.
* 23:45 hours: The two vehicles collide near the intersection with Kärkölä Street 11.
* 23:46 hours: Marko Salmi and Sofia Lindström exit their vehicles, exchange information, and provide statements to witnesses.

Vehicle Information:

Marko Salmi's vehicle is a 2018 Volkswagen Golf (license plate FJK-123) with front-end damage, including a crushed bumper and a cracked windshield. The vehicle sustained significant damage from the collision.

Sofia Lindström's vehicle is a 2020 Skoda Octavia (license plate GHI-456) with minor damage to its rear bumper and a small scratch on the driver's side door.

Weather Conditions:

The overcast weather conditions, combined with light drizzle, reduced visibility and made road surfaces slippery. The wet pavement contributed to the loss of traction by both vehicles, leading to the collision.

Road Conditions:

Kärkölä Street 12 was wet and slippery at the time of the incident, with a layer of water covering the surface. The incline near the intersection with Kärkölä Street 11 added to the challenge for both drivers.

Witness Statements:

Juhani Lehtinen, who witnessed the incident from a distance, reported that Marko Salmi's vehicle was traveling at an excessive speed before the collision. He also stated that Sofia Lindström's vehicle was traveling at a reasonable speed and had sufficient time to react to the situation.

Conclusion:

The investigation is ongoing, but it appears that both drivers were at fault for the incident. Marko Salmi failed to yield to Sofia Lindström's vehicle, while Sofia Lindström may have been traveling too slowly to avoid the collision. Further analysis of the evidence and witness statements will be necessary to determine the exact cause of the incident.
