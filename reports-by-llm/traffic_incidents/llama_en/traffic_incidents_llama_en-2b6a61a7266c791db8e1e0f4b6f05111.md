Incident Report: Accident on Kemi Street 12, Kemi, Finland

Date: 13.04.2024
Time of Day: Night
Weather Conditions: Wet and Slippery

On the night of April 13th, 2024, at approximately 23:45 hours, I responded to a report of a three-vehicle accident on Kemi Street 12 in Kemi, Finland. The incident involved vehicles registered as follows:

* Vehicle 1: A white Volkswagen Golf (Model Year 2018) with license plate number AKL-123, driven by Mr. Juhani Lehtonen.
* Vehicle 2: A black Ford Focus (Model Year 2020) with license plate number KEM-456, driven by Ms. Sofia Lindström.
* Vehicle 3: A silver Skoda Octavia (Model Year 2015) with license plate number OUL-789, driven by Mr. Antti Salmi.

The accident occurred when the Volkswagen Golf, driven by Mr. Lehtonen, failed to stop at a red traffic light on Kemi Street 12. The vehicle collided with the Ford Focus, which was traveling in the same direction as the Volkswagen Golf. The impact caused both vehicles to lose control and collide with each other.

The Skoda Octavia, which was traveling behind the Ford Focus, attempted to brake but lost traction due to the wet and slippery road conditions. The vehicle skidded on the pavement and collided with the rear of the Ford Focus.

Witnesses reported that the accident occurred suddenly and without warning. One witness, Mr. Pekka Rantanen, who was walking home from work at the time of the incident, stated: "I heard a loud screeching sound and saw all three vehicles collide. It was like a domino effect."

The following timeline of events is based on witness statements and vehicle inspection:

* 23:45 hours: Mr. Lehtonen's Volkswagen Golf approaches the red traffic light on Kemi Street 12.
* 23:45 hours (approximate): The Volkswagen Golf fails to stop at the red traffic light and collides with the Ford Focus.
* 23:45 hours (approximate): The Skoda Octavia, driven by Mr. Salmi, attempts to brake but loses traction due to the wet road conditions and skids into the rear of the Ford Focus.
* 23:46 hours: All three vehicles come to a stop.

Upon arrival at the scene, I observed that:

* The Volkswagen Golf sustained significant damage to its front bumper and hood.
* The Ford Focus had damage to its rear bumper and side panel.
* The Skoda Octavia had damage to its rear bumper and wheel well.

All occupants of the vehicles were shaken but uninjured. Mr. Lehtonen, Ms. Lindström, and Mr. Salmi reported that they were all wearing seatbelts at the time of the accident.

The road conditions on Kemi Street 12 were wet and slippery due to recent rainfall. The pavement was covered in a layer of oil and water, which contributed to the loss of traction by the Skoda Octavia.

This incident report is based on my investigation and witness statements. I have attached photographs of the vehicles involved and the scene as evidence.
