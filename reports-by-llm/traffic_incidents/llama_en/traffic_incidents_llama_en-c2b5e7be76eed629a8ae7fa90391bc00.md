Incident Report: 08.02.2023, Föglö Municipality, Finland

Date: 08.02.2023
Time of Day: Morning
Location: Kustavi Street, 48100 Föglö

On the morning of February 8th, 2023, at approximately 09:45 AM, I responded to a reported traffic incident on Kustavi Street in Föglö Municipality. Upon arrival, I met with the involved parties and gathered information regarding the incident.

The two vehicles involved were a blue Volkswagen Golf (license plate: AKL-123) driven by 32-year-old driver, Antti Lehtonen, and a white Skoda Octavia (license plate: EHK-456) driven by 28-year-old driver, Sofia Lindström. Both drivers were traveling in the same direction on Kustavi Street when the incident occurred.

According to witness statements, including that of 45-year-old passenger, Juhani Rissanen, who was a rear-seat passenger in Lehtonen's vehicle, the incident began when Lindström failed to yield to Lehtonen at the intersection of Kustavi Street and Salmijärvi Road. Lehtonen attempted to merge onto Salmijärvi Road, but Lindström did not slow down or stop, resulting in a head-on collision between the two vehicles.

The impact was significant, causing both vehicles to veer off the road and into nearby ditches. The Volkswagen Golf sustained damage to its front bumper and hood, while the Skoda Octavia suffered damage to its front fender and grille.

Weather conditions at the time of the incident were wet and slippery, with a light drizzle falling from the sky. Road surface conditions were hazardous due to the wet pavement, which reduced visibility and traction for both drivers.

Timeline of Events:

* 09:40 AM: Antti Lehtonen begins driving on Kustavi Street.
* 09:42 AM: Sofia Lindström approaches the intersection with Salmijärvi Road from the opposite direction.
* 09:43 AM: Lehtonen attempts to merge onto Salmijärvi Road, but Lindström fails to yield or slow down.
* 09:44 AM: The two vehicles collide head-on at the intersection of Kustavi Street and Salmijärvi Road.
* 09:45 AM: Witnesses report the incident and call the police.

Injuries were reported on both drivers. Antti Lehtonen sustained minor injuries, including a bruised shoulder and a cut on his forehead. Sofia Lindström suffered more severe injuries, including a broken collarbone and a concussion.

Both vehicles were towed from the scene by local towing services. The incident is currently under investigation, with further details pending review of evidence and witness statements.
