Incident Summary:

On 17 August 2023 at approximately 09:45, two vehicles were involved in a collision on Kivikatu 12 in Luum채ki. The incident occurred during the morning rush hour.

Narrative of Events:

The first vehicle, a white Volkswagen Golf (License Plate: FNI-123), was traveling northbound on Kivikatu 12 when it failed to yield to the second vehicle, a blue Opel Astra (License Plate: OPE-456). The driver of the Opel Astra, Mr. Antti Lehtonen, was attempting to merge onto Kivikatu 12 from the side street, Rantakatu.

As the Volkswagen Golf approached the intersection, it slowed down due to strong gusts caused by the wind. Meanwhile, the Opel Astra continued straight ahead, failing to notice the Volkswagen Golf's slowing speed. The two vehicles collided at approximately 09:45, causing significant damage to both vehicles.

Witnesses reported that the collision was sudden and unexpected, with the Volkswagen Golf's front bumper striking the Opel Astra's side mirror. Mr. Lehtonen, who was driving alone, sustained minor injuries but refused medical attention on the scene.
