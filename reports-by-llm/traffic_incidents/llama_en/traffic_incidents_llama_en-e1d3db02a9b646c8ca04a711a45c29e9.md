On November 25, 2024, at 06:45 hours, a multi-vehicle accident occurred on Kaskinen Road 1234 in Kaskinen Municipality, Finland. The incident involved seven vehicles, resulting in significant damage and injuries.

Narrative:

The accident began when driver, Juhani Lehtonen (born 1985), lost control of his vehicle, a Toyota Corolla (2018) with license plate number FI-123456, while driving on Kaskinen Road 1234. The Corolla collided with the rear bumper of a Volkswagen Golf (2020) driven by passenger, Maria Lindström (born 1992). The impact caused both vehicles to swerve into the adjacent lane, where they struck a Ford Focus (2019) driven by driver, Antti Kärkkäinen (born 1988).

As a result of the collision, the Volkswagen Golf and Ford Focus were pushed onto the shoulder of the road. The Corolla then collided with a Skoda Octavia (2017) driven by passenger, Sofia Jensen (born 1995), who was traveling in the opposite direction on Kaskinen Road 1234.

Witnesses reported that the accident occurred suddenly, without warning, and that all parties involved were shaken but uninjured. The scene was chaotic, with debris scattered across the road and surrounding areas.
