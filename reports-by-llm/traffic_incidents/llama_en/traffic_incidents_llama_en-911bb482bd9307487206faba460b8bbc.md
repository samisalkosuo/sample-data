Date: 29.09.2024
Time of Day: Morning
Location: Tuusula, Finland (Tuulensilta Street, 10)

At approximately 08:45 hours, I responded to a report of a two-vehicle collision on Tuulensilta Street in Tuusula. Upon arrival, I observed that the incident involved a blue Volkswagen Golf with license plate number FI-123456 and a silver Toyota Corolla with license plate number FI-987654.

The drivers involved were identified as 32-year-old Marko Laaksonen from Espoo and 28-year-old Sofia Jensen from Helsinki. Both vehicles were traveling in opposite directions when they collided at the intersection of Tuulensilta Street and Kivikatu Street.

According to witness statements, including those from pedestrians who were walking in the area, the Volkswagen Golf was traveling northbound on Tuulensilta Street at a speed of approximately 40 km/h. The Toyota Corolla was traveling southbound on Tuulensilta Street at a speed of approximately 30 km/h.

As the two vehicles approached each other, the driver of the Volkswagen Golf failed to yield to the traffic from the opposite direction, resulting in a head-on collision. The impact caused significant damage to both vehicles, with the Volkswagen Golf sustaining front-end damage and the Toyota Corolla suffering rear-end damage.

Witnesses reported that the weather conditions at the time of the incident were severe, with heavy rain and strong winds associated with a thunderstorm. Visibility was reduced due to the rain, and the road surface was slippery.

The drivers and passengers of both vehicles were shaken but uninjured in the collision. Marko Laaksonen, who was driving the Volkswagen Golf, reported that he had not seen the approaching vehicle due to the poor visibility caused by the storm.

Sofia Jensen, who was driving the Toyota Corolla, stated that she had slowed down to reduce her speed, but it was too late to avoid the collision. Both drivers were cooperative and provided statements to me during the investigation.

The road conditions at the time of the incident were hazardous due to the heavy rain and strong winds. The storm had caused significant flooding in the area, with water covering parts of Tuulensilta Street. The surface was slippery, and the reduced visibility made it difficult for drivers to navigate the road safely.

I conducted a thorough investigation of the scene, including reviewing dashcam footage from both vehicles and inspecting the damage to both vehicles. Based on my findings, I have concluded that the driver of the Volkswagen Golf failed to yield to traffic from the opposite direction, resulting in a preventable collision.
