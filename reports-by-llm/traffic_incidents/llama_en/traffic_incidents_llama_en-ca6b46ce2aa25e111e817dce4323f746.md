On the morning of August 22nd, 2023, at approximately 07:45 hours, I responded to a report of a traffic collision on Kivikatu in Suonenjoki. Upon arrival, I observed two vehicles involved in the incident.

Narrative:

The driver of a white Volkswagen Golf (license plate: FNI-123) was traveling northbound on Kivikatu when he failed to yield to an approaching vehicle. The Golf collided with a silver Skoda Octavia (license plate: OSA-456), which was traveling eastbound on the same street.

The driver of the Skoda Octavia, 41-year-old Marko Salmi from Kuopio, stated that he had been traveling cautiously and had not seen the Volkswagen Golf until it was too late. He reported that his vehicle sustained significant damage to its front bumper and hood.

Witnesses reported that the road conditions were dry but slippery due to the cold weather. The incident occurred on a slight incline, which may have contributed to the severity of the collision.
