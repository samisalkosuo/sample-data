Narrative:

The scene was investigated by Officer Juhani Laaksonen (Badge Number: 1234) of the Isojoki Police Department. Upon arrival, it was observed that all four vehicles had come to a stop on Kivikatu, approximately 50 meters from the intersection with Pajamiehenkuja.

Witness statements indicated that driver, 35-year-old Marko Salmi (license plate: FJK-123), was traveling northbound on Kivikatu in his 2018 Volkswagen Golf (FHK-456) when he failed to stop at a red light. As a result, he collided with the rear of a vehicle being driven by 28-year-old Sofia Lehtonen (license plate: EKL-789) in her 2020 Toyota Corolla (EKL-123).

The impact caused both vehicles to lose control and collide with two other vehicles that were stopped at the intersection. The first collision involved driver, 42-year-old Jari Välimaa (license plate: JVV-901), who was driving his 2015 Ford Focus (JVV-456) in a southerly direction on Kivikatu. The second collision involved passenger, 25-year-old Emma Lindström (license plate: ELL-789), who was riding as a passenger in the rear seat of Sofia Lehtonen's vehicle.

All four vehicles sustained significant damage, with Marko Salmi's Volkswagen Golf suffering extensive front-end damage and Sofia Lehtonen's Toyota Corolla experiencing significant rear-end damage. Jari Välimaa's Ford Focus had its front bumper and grille severely damaged, while Emma Lindström was treated for minor injuries.
