Date: 27 November 2023

Location: Kruununpuistonkatu 12, Maarianhamina

Time of Day: Evening (approx. 20:45)

Weather Conditions: Overcast with light drizzle

Investigator's Notes:

On the evening of 27 November 2023, at approximately 20:45, I responded to a report of a traffic collision on Kruununpuistonkatu in Maarianhamina. Upon arrival, I observed three vehicles involved in the incident.

Narrative:

The driver of a silver 2018 Volkswagen Golf (license plate: FNI-123) was traveling northbound on Kruunanpuistokatu when he failed to stop at the intersection with Merisilta. The vehicle struck a white 2020 Toyota Corolla (license plate: OSA-456) that was stopped at the red light, causing significant damage to both vehicles.

The driver of the Volkswagen Golf, Mr. Antti Lehtonen, reported that he had not seen the Toyota Corolla due to his own distraction while using his phone. The passenger in the Volkswagen Golf, Ms. Sofia Lindstr√∂m, sustained minor injuries from the impact.

The driver of the Toyota Corolla, Mrs. Maria Rodriguez, was shaken but uninjured. She stated that she had been waiting for a friend at the intersection and had not seen the approaching vehicle.

Witnesses reported that the road conditions were slippery due to the light drizzle, which may have contributed to the accident.

Timeline:

* 20:40: The Volkswagen Golf approaches the intersection of Kruunanpuistokatu and Merisilta.
* 20:41: The Toyota Corolla stops at the red light.
* 20:42: The Volkswagen Golf fails to stop and strikes the Toyota Corolla.
* 20:43: The driver of the Volkswagen Golf reports the incident to passersby.

Vehicle Damage:

The Volkswagen Golf sustained significant damage to its front bumper, hood, and passenger side door. The Toyota Corolla suffered damage to its front bumper, hood, and passenger side mirror.

Witness Statements:

Ms. Anna-Maria Kallio, a pedestrian who witnessed the accident from across the street, reported that she saw the Volkswagen Golf fail to stop at the intersection. She stated that the driver seemed distracted and was not paying attention to the road.

Mr. Juhani Virtanen, a cyclist who was traveling in the opposite direction on Merisilta, reported that he saw the Toyota Corolla stopped at the red light and did not see the approaching Volkswagen Golf.

Conclusion:

The investigation is ongoing, but it appears that the driver of the Volkswagen Golf was distracted by his phone and failed to stop at the intersection. The road conditions were slippery due to the light drizzle, which may have contributed to the accident. Further investigation will be conducted to determine fault and any potential charges.
