At approximately 20:45 hours on 27 December 2023, a multi-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kivikatu and Salminkatu in Jämijärvi. The incident involved ten vehicles, resulting in significant damage and injuries.

The scene was described by witnesses as chaotic, with multiple vehicles overturned or stranded on the side of the road. Emergency services were quickly dispatched to the scene, where they found several injured individuals.

According to eyewitness accounts, the collision began when a white Volkswagen Golf (license plate: FJK-123) driven by 32-year-old driver, Antti Lehtonen, failed to stop at the intersection and collided with a blue Toyota Corolla (license plate: EHU-456) driven by 41-year-old passenger, Sofia Jensen. The impact caused both vehicles to lose control, striking several other cars parked along Salminkatu.

The Volkswagen Golf then careened into a red Ford Focus (license plate: KRA-789), which was occupied by four passengers, including two children. The Ford Focus suffered significant damage to its front end and rear bumper.

As the Volkswagen Golf continued to roll, it struck a silver Honda Civic (license plate: TOL-321) parked along Salminkatu, causing further damage to both vehicles. The Honda Civic's passenger side mirror was severely damaged, while the Volkswagen Golf's front bumper was crushed.

The collision also involved a black BMW 3 Series (license plate: LSV-901), which was driven by 29-year-old driver, Elias Lindström. The BMW 3 Series suffered minor damage to its rear bumper and wheel well.

A white Skoda Octavia (license plate: OHT-456) driven by 35-year-old driver, Maria Rodriguez, attempted to pass the Volkswagen Golf but lost control, striking a blue Nissan Sentra (license plate: NIS-789). The Nissan Sentra's front end was damaged, while the Skoda Octavia suffered minor scratches on its rear bumper.

The incident also involved a yellow Citroen C4 (license plate: CIT-321), which was parked along Salminkatu and struck by the Volkswagen Golf. The Citroen C4's front bumper was severely damaged.

Witnesses reported that the road conditions were hazardous due to the wet and slippery surface, making it difficult for drivers to maintain control of their vehicles.
