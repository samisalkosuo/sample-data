Summary:

On February 28, 2023, at 23:45 hours, a multi-vehicle accident occurred on Kaavi-Kuusamo Road in Kuusamo, Finland. The incident involved nine vehicles, resulting in significant damage and injuries to the occupants.

Narrative:

The accident began when driver, Juhani Laaksonen (born 1985), lost control of his vehicle, a 2018 Toyota Hilux with license plate number FI-123456, while driving on Kaavi-Kuusamo Road. The vehicle veered off the road and collided with a parked car, owned by passenger, Maria Lehtonen (born 1992). The impact caused significant damage to both vehicles.

Witnesses reported that Laaksonen's vehicle was traveling at a high speed before losing control. Passenger, Antti Salmi (born 1988), who was riding in the backseat of the Hilux, sustained minor injuries from the accident.

As Laaksonen attempted to regain control of his vehicle, he collided with another car, driven by driver, Sofia Jensen (born 1995). The impact caused significant damage to both vehicles and sent Jensen's vehicle, a 2019 Volkswagen Golf with license plate number FI-987654, into oncoming traffic.

The accident continued as Laaksonen's vehicle collided with three more cars: a 2020 Ford Focus driven by driver, Elias Kallio (born 1991), a 2017 Skoda Octavia driven by passenger, Emma Lindstrom (born 1994), and a 2018 Honda Civic driven by driver, Leonidas Papadopoulos (born 1982).

The vehicles became entangled in a chain reaction, with each collision causing further damage and injuries to the occupants. The accident ultimately resulted in nine vehicles being involved.
