Incident Report: Mannerheimintie 123, Petäjävesi

Date: 15.09.2023
Time of Day: Night
Weather Conditions: Wet and Slippery

On the night of September 15th, 2023, at approximately 23:45 hours, I responded to a report of a multi-vehicle collision on Mannerheimintie in Petäjävesi. Upon arrival, I observed four vehicles involved in the incident.

The vehicles involved were:

1. A white Volkswagen Passat (FHJ 123) driven by Juhani Laaksonen, a 35-year-old resident of Petäjävesi.
2. A silver Ford Focus (EKD 456) driven by Leena Kärkkäinen, a 28-year-old student from Kuopio.
3. A black Toyota Corolla (LKS 789) driven by Antti Siltanen, a 42-year-old businessman from Jyväskylä.
4. A blue Skoda Octavia (GHD 901) driven by Maria Lindström, a 25-year-old nurse from Helsinki.

The vehicles were traveling in opposite directions on Mannerheimintie when the collision occurred. According to witness statements, Laaksonen's Volkswagen Passat was traveling northbound and failed to yield to traffic approaching from southbound. The Ford Focus driven by Kärkkäinen attempted to pass Laaksonen's vehicle but lost control due to the wet and slippery road conditions.

The Toyota Corolla driven by Siltanen, which was following behind Kärkkäinen's vehicle, struck the rear of the Volkswagen Passat. The Skoda Octavia driven by Lindström, which was traveling southbound, collided with the Ford Focus after attempting to pass Laaksonen's vehicle.

The timeline of events is as follows:

* 23:45 hours: Juhani Laaksonen's Volkswagen Passat collides with Leena Kärkkäinen's Ford Focus.
* 23:46 hours: Antti Siltanen's Toyota Corolla strikes the rear of Laaksonen's Volkswagen Passat.
* 23:47 hours: Maria Lindström's Skoda Octavia collides with Kärkkäinen's Ford Focus.

Witnesses reported that the road conditions were extremely hazardous due to heavy rain and a layer of ice on the surface. The vehicles involved suffered significant damage, including:

* Laaksonen's Volkswagen Passat: Rear bumper damaged, front wheel well dented.
* Kärkkäinen's Ford Focus: Front bumper damaged, side mirror shattered.
* Siltanen's Toyota Corolla: Rear bumper damaged, rear window shattered.
* Lindström's Skoda Octavia: Front bumper damaged, front wheel well dented.

All four drivers and passengers were treated for minor injuries at the scene. The vehicles were towed to a nearby parking lot for further inspection.

This incident highlights the importance of safe driving practices, especially during inclement weather conditions. I recommend that all parties involved in the collision receive traffic safety education and be required to attend a defensive driving course as part of their license renewal process.
