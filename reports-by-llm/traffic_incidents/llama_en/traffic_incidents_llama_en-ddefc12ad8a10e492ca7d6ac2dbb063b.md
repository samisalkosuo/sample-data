Summary of Incident:

At approximately 10:45 AM on January 22nd, 2025, a multi-vehicle collision occurred on Mannerheimintie in Teuva. The incident involved eight vehicles, with multiple parties injured.

According to witness statements and vehicle inspections, the sequence of events was as follows:

1. Vehicle 1 (Volkswagen Golf) driven by Juhani Laaksonen was traveling northbound on Mannerheimintie at approximately 10:40 AM when it failed to yield to traffic from the east.
2. Vehicle 2 (Ford Focus) driven by Leena Rissanen, who was turning left onto Mannerheimintie from a side street, collided with Vehicle 1.
3. As a result of the initial collision, Vehicle 1 lost control and veered into the opposite lane, where it struck Vehicle 3 (Toyota Corolla) driven by Antti Siltanen.
4. The impact caused Vehicle 3 to spin out of control and collide with Vehicle 4 (Honda Civic) driven by Maria Lindström, who was traveling in the same direction as Vehicle 1.
5. The subsequent chain reaction continued with Vehicle 4 striking Vehicle 5 (Skoda Octavia) driven by Pekka Rintala, causing it to lose traction and slide into the median.
6. As Vehicle 5 slid into the median, it struck Vehicle 6 (Subaru Impreza) driven by Hanna Kallio, who was traveling in the opposite direction on Mannerheimintie.
7. The collision between Vehicle 6 and Vehicle 5 caused a significant impact, which in turn led to Vehicle 7 (Citroen C4) driven by Jari Välimaa losing control and crashing into Vehicle 8 (Kia Rio) driven by Sanna Lehtonen.
8. Finally, the rear-end collision between Vehicle 8 and Vehicle 7 caused a significant impact, which in turn led to Vehicle 1 coming to rest against the median.

Weather Conditions:

The weather on January 22nd, 2025, was clear and sunny with a temperature of approximately 2°C. The road surface was dry, but there were some minor ice patches present due to recent snowmelt.

Road Conditions:

Mannerheimintie was in good condition, with no reported hazards or obstructions prior to the incident. However, the presence of ice patches on the road may have contributed to the loss of traction experienced by several vehicles involved in the collision.

Vehicle 1 (Volkswagen Golf) suffered extensive front-end damage, while Vehicle 2 (Ford Focus) had significant left-front and rear-end damage.
