On the morning of 12 July 2025, at approximately 08:45 hours, officers from the Tervola Police Department responded to a multi-vehicle collision on Kivikatu in Tervola. The incident involved seven vehicles and resulted in significant damage and injuries.

The scene was described by witnesses as chaotic, with debris scattered across the road and surrounding sidewalks. Officer Juhani Laaksonen, who arrived at the scene first, reported that the vehicles were parked along both sides of Kivikatu, approximately 50 meters apart from each other.

According to eyewitness accounts, the incident began when a white Volkswagen Golf (license plate: AKL-123) driven by 32-year-old driver, Antti Salmi, failed to stop at a red light. The vehicle collided with a black Audi A4 (license plate: EKA-456) driven by 28-year-old passenger, Sofia Jensen, who was on her way to work.

Sofia's vehicle struck the rear of a silver Toyota Corolla (license plate: TOL-789), which was parked along the curb. The impact caused the Toyota to roll backwards and collide with a blue Ford Focus (license plate: KOR-321) driven by 41-year-old driver, Marko Lehtonen.

Marko's vehicle then struck the front of a red Honda Civic (license plate: HON-456), which was parked along the opposite curb. The Honda's front bumper was severely damaged in the collision.

As the vehicles continued to move, they collided with a green Subaru Outback (license plate: SUB-123) driven by 35-year-old driver, Emma Lindstrom, who was on her way to drop off children at school. The Subaru's rear bumper was also severely damaged.

The final vehicle involved in the incident was a yellow Citroen C4 (license plate: CIT-789), which was parked along the sidewalk and struck by the Subaru. The Citroen suffered significant damage to its front bumper and hood.

Witnesses reported that the drivers of all vehicles involved were shaken but uninjured. Officer Laaksonen stated, "The scene was chaotic, but fortunately, no one was seriously injured. However, the road conditions and weather made it difficult for us to assess the full extent of the damage."

Weather Conditions:
The morning of 12 July 2025 began with clear skies and dry roads. However, as the investigation progressed, it became apparent that the cold temperatures had caused the asphalt to become brittle, making it more prone to cracking. The road surface was also slippery due to a layer of frost that had formed overnight.

Road Conditions:
The road conditions were hazardous, with several vehicles experiencing significant damage to their bumpers and hoods. The asphalt was cracked in several areas, and there were several potholes present on the road.
