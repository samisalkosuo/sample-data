Incident Report: Accident on Säkylänkatu 12, Säkylä, Finland

Date: January 11, 2023
Time of Day: Night
Weather Conditions: Wet and Slippery

On the night of January 11, 2023, at approximately 23:45 hours, I responded to a report of an accident on Säkylänkatu 12 in Säkylä. Upon arrival, I observed three vehicles involved in the incident.

The vehicles involved were:

1. A white Volkswagen Golf ( registration number: FST-123) driven by Juhani Lehtonen, a 35-year-old resident of Säkylä.
2. A silver Toyota Corolla (registration number: EHK-456) driven by Maria Lindström, a 28-year-old student from Säkylä.
3. A black Ford Focus (registration number: KTS-789) driven by Antti Virtanen, a 42-year-old businessman from Säkylä.

According to witnesses, the accident occurred when Juhani Lehtonen's Volkswagen Golf collided with Maria Lindström's Toyota Corolla while both vehicles were traveling in the same direction on Säkylänkatu. The impact caused Maria Lindström's vehicle to lose control and cross into the opposite lane, where it struck Antti Virtanen's Ford Focus.

Witnesses reported that the road conditions were wet and slippery due to recent rainfall, which contributed to the loss of traction by all three vehicles involved. The accident occurred on a slight downhill slope, which may have also played a role in the loss of control.

The timeline of events is as follows:

* 23:45 hours: Juhani Lehtonen's Volkswagen Golf collides with Maria Lindström's Toyota Corolla.
* 23:46 hours: Maria Lindström's vehicle loses control and crosses into the opposite lane, striking Antti Virtanen's Ford Focus.
* 23:47 hours: All three vehicles come to a stop on Säkylänkatu.

Upon investigation, it was determined that none of the drivers were seriously injured. However, all three vehicles sustained significant damage. Juhani Lehtonen's Volkswagen Golf suffered front-end damage and a cracked windshield. Maria Lindström's Toyota Corolla had significant damage to its passenger-side door and frame. Antti Virtanen's Ford Focus had damage to its rear bumper and wheel wells.

The accident was caused by the combination of wet and slippery road conditions, as well as the loss of traction by all three vehicles involved. The drivers were not at fault due to the hazardous road conditions.

This incident report is based on eyewitness accounts, vehicle inspections, and witness statements. All information has been verified and is accurate to the best of my knowledge.
