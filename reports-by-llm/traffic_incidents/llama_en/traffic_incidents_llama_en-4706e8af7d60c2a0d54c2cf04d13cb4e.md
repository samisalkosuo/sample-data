Date: 08.05.2025
Time of Day: Morning
Location: Kivikatu 12, Oulainen

On the morning of May 8th, 2025, at approximately 07:45 hours, I responded to a report of a two-vehicle collision on Kivikatu in Oulainen municipality. The incident involved vehicles registered to residents of the local area.

The first vehicle involved was a white Volkswagen Golf (Model Y) with license plate number AKL 123, driven by Mr. Antti Lehtonen, a 35-year-old resident of Kivikatu 12. Mr. Lehtonen was traveling northbound on Kivikatu when he failed to yield to the second vehicle.

The second vehicle involved was a silver Ford Focus (Model ST) with license plate number EKA 456, driven by Mrs. Sofia Jensen, a 28-year-old resident of Kivikatu 15. Mrs. Jensen was traveling southbound on Kivikatu in the left lane when Mr. Lehtonen's vehicle entered her lane without yielding.

According to eyewitnesses, including Mr. Juhani Rissanen, a witness who lives at Kivikatu 10, the collision occurred when Mrs. Jensen's vehicle struck the rear bumper of Mr. Lehtonen's Volkswagen Golf. The impact caused significant damage to both vehicles, with the Ford Focus sustaining a crushed rear bumper and the Volkswagen Golf suffering a damaged rear quarter panel.

The weather conditions on the day of the incident were windy with gusts reaching up to 50 km/h. This made it difficult for drivers to maintain control of their vehicles, particularly in the morning hours when visibility is reduced due to the early morning sun.

Timeline of Events:

* 07:45 hours: Mr. Lehtonen's Volkswagen Golf collides with Mrs. Jensen's Ford Focus.
* 07:46 hours: Eyewitnesses report the incident and call the police.
* 07:50 hours: I arrive at the scene and begin taking statements from witnesses and drivers involved.

Weather Conditions:

The weather on the day of the incident was characterized by strong winds with gusts reaching up to 50 km/h. The wind direction was from the west, which made it difficult for drivers to maintain control of their vehicles. Visibility was reduced due to the early morning sun, making it challenging for drivers to see pedestrians and other vehicles.

Road Conditions:

The road conditions on Kivikatu were wet and slippery due to the windy weather. The surface was covered in a thin layer of rainwater, which made it difficult for tires to grip the road. This contributed to the loss of control by both drivers involved in the collision.

Damage Assessment:

Both vehicles sustained significant damage as a result of the collision. The Ford Focus had a crushed rear bumper and suffered minor scratches on its front bumper. The Volkswagen Golf had a damaged rear quarter panel and suffered minor scratches on its front bumper.

Injuries:

Neither driver was injured in the collision, although both reported feeling shaken by the incident.

Investigation:

The investigation is ongoing, and I will be reviewing dashcam footage from both vehicles to determine the cause of the collision.
