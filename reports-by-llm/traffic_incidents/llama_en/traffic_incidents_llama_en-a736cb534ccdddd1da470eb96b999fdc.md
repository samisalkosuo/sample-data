On the evening of April 18th, 2023, at approximately 21:45 hours, a multi-vehicle collision occurred on Kivikatu 123 in Joutsa. The incident involved eleven vehicles and resulted in significant damage to property.

The scene was illuminated by the faint glow of streetlights, casting long shadows across the wet pavement. Light rain fell from the sky, creating a misty atmosphere that reduced visibility. Witnesses reported that the rain made it difficult to see clearly, with puddles forming on the road.

According to eyewitness accounts, the incident began when driver Antti Laaksonen (M 1985) of Kivikatu 123 lost control of his vehicle while driving at a high speed. The car, a 2018 Toyota Corolla (EU 12-4567), veered off the road and collided with a parked car, a 2012 Volkswagen Passat (EU 23-9011), belonging to driver Leena Kärkkäinen (F 1980) of Kivikatu 123.

The impact caused Laaksonen's vehicle to spin out of control, striking several other vehicles parked along the street. The cars involved were:

* Toyota Corolla (EU 12-4567), driven by Antti Laaksonen
* Volkswagen Passat (EU 23-9011), driven by Leena Kärkkäinen
* Ford Focus (EU 15-3456), driven by driver Juhani Virtanen (M 1982) of Kivikatu 123
* Skoda Octavia (EU 20-6789), driven by passenger Sofia Lindström (F 1990)
* Honda Civic (EU 11-2345), driven by driver Markus Salmi (M 1988) of Kivikatu 123
* Suzuki Swift (EU 17-9876), driven by driver Anna-Maria Rissanen (F 1992) of Kivikatu 123
* Kia Cee'd (EU 24-3457), driven by passenger Elias Lehtonen (M 1985)
* Volkswagen Golf (EU 13-6788), driven by driver Eero Mäkelä (M 1984) of Kivikatu 123
* Peugeot 208 (EU 19-9012), driven by driver Hanna Virtanen (F 1991) of Kivikatu 123
* Seat Leon (EU 16-4568), driven by passenger Oskari Lappi (M 1989)
* BMW 3 Series (EU 25-3457), driven by driver Pekka Rissanen (M 1975)

The vehicles involved were all parked along Kivikatu 123, with some of them facing the wrong direction. The drivers and passengers were shaken but uninjured.

Witnesses reported that the incident occurred suddenly, without warning, and that Laaksonen's vehicle seemed to lose control without any apparent reason. The rain made it difficult for witnesses to see clearly, but they described the scene as chaotic and confusing.

The police arrived at the scene shortly after 22:00 hours and began investigating the incident. Traffic was diverted around the area, and all vehicles were removed from the scene. The road was cleaned up, and the wet pavement was treated with salt to improve traction.

This report is based on eyewitness accounts and witness statements. Further investigation is ongoing, and additional information may be gathered in the coming days.
