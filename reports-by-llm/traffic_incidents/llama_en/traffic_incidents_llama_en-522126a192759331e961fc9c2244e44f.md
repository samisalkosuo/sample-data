The incident began when driver, Juhani Laaksonen (born 1985), lost control of his 2018 Volkswagen Golf (FH7-123) while driving northbound on Mannerheimintie. The vehicle veered off the road and collided with a parked car at 12 Mannerheimintie. The impact caused significant damage to both vehicles.

The subsequent chain reaction involved several other vehicles, including a 2020 Ford Focus (GTY-789) driven by driver, Maria Salmi (born 1995), who collided with the rear of Laaksonen's vehicle. The impact caused significant damage to both vehicles and sent Salmi's vehicle into a nearby snowbank.

Witnesses reported that several other drivers attempted to avoid the collision, but were unable to do so due to the hazardous road conditions.
