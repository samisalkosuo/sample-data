Location: Kruununhaka Street, 50100 Mikkeli

Time of Day: Morning

Weather Conditions: Overcast with light drizzle

Investigator's Notes:

On the morning of May 8th, 2024, at approximately 07:45 hours, I responded to a report of a multi-vehicle accident on Kruununhaka Street in Mikkeli. The incident involved six vehicles and resulted in injuries to two individuals.

Narrative:

The accident occurred when driver, Juhani Laaksonen (born 1985), failed to yield to pedestrians crossing the street at the intersection with Kaarina Street. Laaksonen's vehicle, a white Toyota Corolla (license plate: FJK-123) with Finnish registration, was traveling northbound on Kruunanhaka Street when it struck a pedestrian, Maria Lehtonen (born 1992), who was attempting to cross the street.

Lehtonen suffered minor injuries and was transported to Mikkeli Central Hospital for observation. The pedestrian's vehicle, a silver Volkswagen Golf (license plate: AKA-456) with Finnish registration, was parked on the side of the road at the time of the accident.

Laaksonen's vehicle then struck another vehicle, a black Ford Focus (license plate: TJK-789) driven by driver, Antti Virtanen (born 1980), who was traveling southbound on Kruunanhaka Street. The impact caused significant damage to both vehicles and sent Virtanen's vehicle into the adjacent lane.

Virtanen's vehicle then collided with a white Audi A4 (license plate: FJK-901) driven by driver, Sofia Lindström (born 1995), who was traveling northbound on Kruunanhaka Street. The impact caused significant damage to both vehicles and sent Lindström's vehicle into the median.

Finally, Virtanen's vehicle struck a red Honda Civic (license plate: TJK-234) driven by driver, Jari Siltanen (born 1975), who was traveling southbound on Kruunanhaka Street. The impact caused significant damage to both vehicles and sent Siltanen's vehicle into the adjacent lane.

Witnesses reported that the weather conditions at the time of the accident were overcast with light drizzle, reducing visibility and making road conditions slippery.
