Incident Summary:

On the evening of June 29th, 2023, at approximately 21:15 hours, two vehicles were involved in a collision on Kivipuisto Street in Vimpeli. The incident occurred when driver, Juhani Laaksonen (born 1985), failed to yield to pedestrian, Maria Lehtonen (born 1992), who was crossing the street at the intersection of Kivipuisto and Puistokatu.

Narrative:

Juhani Laaksonen, a 38-year-old resident of Vimpeli, was driving his 2015 Volkswagen Golf, license plate number FI-123456, northbound on Kivipuisto Street. Maria Lehtonen, a 25-year-old student at the local university, was walking eastbound on Puistokatu when she attempted to cross Kivipuisto Street. Laaksonen failed to notice Lehtonen in his rearview mirror and did not slow down or yield to her.

As a result, Lehtonen was struck by the Volkswagen Golf, which sustained significant damage to its rear bumper and passenger-side door. The impact also caused Lehtonen's 2018 Honda Civic, license plate number FI-987654, to collide with a nearby parked car, a 2007 Suzuki Swift, owned by local resident, Antti Kärkkäinen.

Witnesses reported that the wind was strong during the incident, causing debris and loose objects to be blown around the scene. The road surface was wet due to recent rainfall, which may have contributed to Laaksonen's loss of control.
