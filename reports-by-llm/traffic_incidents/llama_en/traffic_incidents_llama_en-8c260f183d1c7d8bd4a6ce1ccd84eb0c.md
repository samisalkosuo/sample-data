Summary:

On the evening of May 19th, 2024, at approximately 20:45, a multi-vehicle collision occurred on Mannerheimintie in Rusko, Finland. The incident involved four vehicles, resulting in damage and injuries.

Narrative:

The scene was investigated by Officer Juhani Laaksonen (Badge Number: 1234) of the Rusko Police Department. Upon arrival, it was observed that all four vehicles had come to a stop on Mannerheimintie, approximately 50 meters from the intersection with Kruununhaka Street.

Witness statements indicated that the incident began when driver, 35-year-old Marko Salmi (license plate: FNI-123), failed to yield to an approaching vehicle. Salmi's vehicle, a 2018 Toyota Corolla, was traveling northbound on Mannerheimintie at approximately 60 km/h when it collided with the rear of a 2020 Volkswagen Golf driven by 28-year-old Sofia Lehtonen (license plate: FNI-456). The impact caused both vehicles to swerve into the adjacent lane, where they collided with a 2015 Ford Focus driven by 42-year-old Juhani Virtanen (license plate: FNI-789).

As the vehicles continued to collide, a 2022 Skoda Octavia driven by 25-year-old Emma Lindström (license plate: FNI-321) rear-ended the Ford Focus. The force of the impact caused both vehicles to spin out of control and come to rest on the side of the road.

All four drivers were shaken but uninjured. Witnesses reported that the wind was strong, with gusts reaching up to 50 km/h, which may have contributed to the severity of the incident.
