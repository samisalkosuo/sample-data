On May 15th, 2025, at approximately 08:45 hours, officers responded to a report of a two-vehicle collision on Kivikatu in Muhos. The incident involved vehicles registered to residents of the local area.

The first vehicle involved was a white Volkswagen Golf, license plate number FI-123456, driven by 32-year-old driver, Antti Lehtonen. Mr. Lehtonen was accompanied by his 6-year-old daughter, Aino, who was riding in the passenger seat. The vehicle was traveling northbound on Kivikatu when it failed to stop at a red light.

The second vehicle involved was a silver Skoda Octavia, license plate number FI-987654, driven by 41-year-old driver, Sofia Lindström. Ms. Lindström was alone in the vehicle and was also traveling northbound on Kivikatu. She reported that she had stopped at the red light but did not see the Volkswagen Golf.

As the Volkswagen Golf failed to stop, it collided with the rear of the Skoda Octavia. The impact caused significant damage to both vehicles. Mr. Lehtonen and his daughter Aino were shaken but uninjured in the collision.

Witnesses reported that the road was slippery due to snowfall overnight, which reduced visibility and made stopping at the red light more difficult. The weather conditions were described as "very snowy" with a wind speed of approximately 15 km/h.

The scene was processed by officers, who collected statements from all parties involved and witnesses. Both drivers cooperated fully with the investigation.

Damage to vehicles:

* Volkswagen Golf (FI-123456): Front bumper and rear quarter panel damaged.
* Skoda Octavia (FI-987654): Rear bumper and trunk lid damaged.

Injuries: None reported.

Citations or charges will be issued at a later date as necessary.
