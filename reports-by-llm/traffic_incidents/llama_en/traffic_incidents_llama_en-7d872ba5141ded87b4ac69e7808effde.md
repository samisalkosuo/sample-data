On the morning of 20th September 2024, at approximately 09:45 hours, I responded to a report of a two-vehicle collision on Kivikatu in Hausjärvi. Upon arrival, I met with the involved parties and witnesses.

The vehicles involved were a white Volkswagen Golf (license plate: FJK-123) driven by Mr. Antti Lehtonen, a 35-year-old resident of Hausjärvi, and a silver Ford Focus (license plate: EHU-456) driven by Ms. Sofia Lindström, a 28-year-old student from Helsinki.

According to the witnesses, including Mr. Juhani Kallio, a passerby who stopped at the scene, the incident occurred when the Volkswagen Golf was traveling northbound on Kivikatu and failed to yield to the Ford Focus, which was turning right onto Kivikatu from a side street. The two vehicles collided, causing significant damage to both vehicles.
