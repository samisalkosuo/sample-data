On the morning of 1st May 2025, at approximately 08:45 hours, I, Officer Juhani Laaksonen (Badge Number: 1234), responded to a reported traffic incident on Kivikatu in Ranua. Upon arrival, I observed two vehicles involved in a collision.

The drivers involved were identified as:

2. Driver B: Sofia Lindström, female, age 28, from Oulu.

Both drivers were wearing seatbelts at the time of the incident.

Witnesses reported that both vehicles were traveling northbound on Kivikatu when they failed to yield to each other at the intersection with Yliopistokatu. Driver A's vehicle, a white Toyota Corolla (license plate: FNT-123), collided with Driver B's silver Volkswagen Golf (license plate: RAN-456).

The collision occurred in the vicinity of Kivikatu 12, approximately 20 meters from the intersection. The impact was significant, causing both vehicles to come to a stop.

Weather Conditions:

The weather was dry, but cold. Temperatures were around 2°C, and wind speeds were moderate (approximately 15 km/h). The road surface was wet from previous snowmelt, making it slippery in some areas.

Kivikatu was wet and icy in the vicinity of the collision. The intersection with Yliopistokatu had a layer of black ice, which contributed to the loss of traction by both vehicles.

Driver A's Toyota Corolla sustained significant damage to its front bumper and hood. Driver B's Volkswagen Golf suffered damage to its front fender and side panel.

Injuries:

Neither driver was injured in the incident. However, Sofia Lindström reported minor discomfort due to a bruised shoulder.
