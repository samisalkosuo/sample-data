Investigator's Notes:

On October 26, 2023, at approximately 08:45 hours, I responded to a report of a vehicle collision on Kivikatu 12 in Hyrynsalmi. Upon arrival, I observed two vehicles involved in the incident.

The driver of the first vehicle, a white Volkswagen Golf with license plate number FI-123456, was traveling northbound on Kivikatu when it failed to yield to the second vehicle, a blue Opel Astra with license plate number FI-789012.
