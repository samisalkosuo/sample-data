On the night of 18th May 2025, at approximately 23:45 hours, a multi-vehicle collision occurred on Kruunanranta Street in Varkaus Municipality. The incident involved four vehicles and resulted in significant damage to property.

The drivers involved were identified as:

1. Juhani Laaksonen (male, 32 years old), driver of a white Toyota Corolla with license plate number AKL-123.
2. Maria Lehtonen (female, 28 years old), passenger of the Toyota Corolla.
3. Antti Virtanen (male, 41 years old), driver of a black Volkswagen Passat with license plate number VRT-456.
4. Eeva-Maija Kallio (female, 25 years old), passenger of the Volkswagen Passat.

Witnesses reported that Juhani Laaksonen was traveling northbound on Kruunanranta Street when he failed to stop at a red traffic light and collided with Antti Virtanen's vehicle. The impact caused both vehicles to swerve into the adjacent lane, where they struck two other vehicles: a blue Ford Focus driven by Sanna-Mari Rissanen (female, 29 years old) from the eastbound lane, and a green Honda Civic driven by Juhani Kärkkäinen (male, 35 years old) from the westbound lane.

The timeline of events is as follows:

* 23:45 hours: Juhani Laaksonen's Toyota Corolla approaches the red traffic light on Kruunanranta Street.
* 23:45:05 hours: The traffic light turns red, but Laaksonen fails to stop and continues driving northbound.
* 23:45:10 hours: Antti Virtanen's Volkswagen Passat is struck by Laaksonen's vehicle, causing both vehicles to swerve into the adjacent lane.
* 23:45:15 hours: Sanna-Mari Rissanen's Ford Focus is struck by Virtanen's vehicle, while Juhani Kärkkäinen's Honda Civic is also struck.

Weather conditions at the time of the incident were mixed snow and rain. The road surface was slippery due to the presence of ice and water, which contributed to the loss of traction among the vehicles involved. Visibility was reduced due to heavy snowfall, making it difficult for drivers to see pedestrians and other vehicles.

The damage sustained by the vehicles is as follows:

* Juhani Laaksonen's Toyota Corolla: Front bumper and hood damaged, with significant scratches on the front grille.
* Antti Virtanen's Volkswagen Passat: Rear bumper and trunk lid damaged, with a cracked windshield.
* Sanna-Mari Rissanen's Ford Focus: Front bumper and side panel damaged, with a broken headlight.
* Juhani Kärkkäinen's Honda Civic: Front bumper and hood damaged, with significant scratches on the front grille.

All drivers involved were shaken but uninjured. The incident is currently under investigation by the Varkaus Police Department.
