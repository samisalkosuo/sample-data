Incident Report: M 24.05.2024, Taivalkoski Municipality

Date: 24th May 2024
Time of Day: Morning
Location: Kylmäntie 12, Taivalkoski

On the morning of 24th May 2024, at approximately 08:45 hours, I responded to a multi-vehicle collision on Kylmäntie in Taivalkoski. The incident involved eight vehicles and resulted in significant damage and injuries.

The scene was found to be snowy, with visibility reduced due to the heavy snowfall. The road surface was icy, making it difficult for drivers to maintain traction.

According to witness statements, the collision occurred when a white Ford Focus (license plate: AKL 123) driven by Mr. Juhani Lehtonen, failed to stop at a red light at the intersection of Kylmäntie and Yliopistokatu. The vehicle struck a black Toyota Corolla (license plate: ESD 456) parked on the side of the road.

The impact caused the Ford Focus to lose control, striking a silver Volkswagen Golf (license plate: HSL 789) that was traveling in the opposite direction. The Volkswagen Golf then collided with a blue Honda Civic (license plate: KKL 012), which was stopped at the red light. The Honda Civic was pushed forward, striking a green Subaru Outback (license plate: TTT 345) parked on the side of the road.

The Subaru Outback then struck a white Audi A4 (license plate: LSV 678) that was traveling behind it. The Audi A4 was forced to swerve onto the sidewalk, where it collided with a red Nissan Sentra (license plate: MTT 901).

Witnesses reported that Mr. Lehtonen's vehicle was traveling at a high speed before the collision and that he failed to yield to oncoming traffic.

The following vehicles were involved in the incident:

* Ford Focus (AKL 123): Damaged front bumper, dented hood
* Toyota Corolla (ESD 456): Minor scratches on side panel
* Volkswagen Golf (HSL 789): Dented rear quarter panel, cracked windshield
* Honda Civic (KKL 012): Scratches on front bumper, minor damage to passenger-side mirror
* Subaru Outback (TTT 345): Minor scratches on front bumper, dented hood
* Audi A4 (LSV 678): Cracked windshield, damaged side mirror
* Nissan Sentra (MTT 901): Minor scratches on front bumper

Injuries were reported by two passengers in the Honda Civic and one passenger in the Subaru Outback. All parties involved were treated at the scene by emergency medical services.

The investigation is ongoing, and further details will be provided as they become available.
