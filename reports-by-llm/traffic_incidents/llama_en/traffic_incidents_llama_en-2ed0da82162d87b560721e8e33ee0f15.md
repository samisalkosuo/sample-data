Summary:

On the evening of February 4th, 2025, at approximately 20:45, a three-vehicle collision occurred on Koulukatu in Varkaus, Finland. The incident involved vehicles with license plates FI-123456 and FI-987654, as well as a pedestrian.

Narrative:

The scene was illuminated by the faint glow of streetlights, casting long shadows across the wet pavement. Heavy rain had been falling throughout the day, reducing visibility to mere meters. Witness, Juhani Lehtonen (age 32), who was walking home from work at the time of the incident, reported that he heard a loud screeching sound coming from the direction of Koulukatu 12.

According to Lehtonen, a white Toyota Corolla (FI-123456) driven by 25-year-old driver, Antti Virtanen, was traveling northbound on Koulukatu when it lost control due to excessive speed and hydroplaning. The vehicle crossed over into the southbound lane, where it collided with a black Volkswagen Golf (FI-987654) driven by 40-year-old driver, Sanna Lappi.

The impact caused both vehicles to swerve off the road, coming to rest against a utility pole on the opposite side of the street. The pedestrian, Juhani Lehtonen, was shaken but uninjured in the incident.
