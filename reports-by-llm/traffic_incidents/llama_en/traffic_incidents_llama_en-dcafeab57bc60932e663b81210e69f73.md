At approximately 08:45 hours, I, Officer Juhani Rantanen (Badge Number: 1234), responded to a report of a vehicle collision on Kivimäenkatu in Kankaanpää. Upon arrival, I observed four vehicles involved in the incident.

The vehicles involved were:

1. A white Volkswagen Golf (License Plate: FNT-543) driven by Mr. Antti Siltanen, a 35-year-old resident of Kivimäenkatu 12.

4. A blue Honda Civic (License Plate: NRD-654) driven by Ms. Sofia Jensen, a 25-year-old tourist from Denmark.

The vehicles were traveling in opposite directions on Kivimäenkatu when the collision occurred. According to witness statements, Mr. Siltanen's Volkswagen Golf was traveling northbound and failed to yield to traffic approaching from southbound. The Ford Focus driven by Ms. Lindström attempted to pass Mr. Siltanen's vehicle, but lost control due to the wet and slippery road conditions.
