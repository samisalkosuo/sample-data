Incident Report: MVA Collision on Highway 16

Date: 01.07.2024
Time of Day: Morning
Location: Ruovesi, Finland (near the intersection of Highway 16 and Kivimäentie 123)

At approximately 08:45 hours, I responded to a report of a multi-vehicle collision on Highway 16 in Ruovesi. Upon arrival, I observed that the incident involved eleven vehicles, with multiple injuries reported.

The vehicles involved were:

* A white Volkswagen Golf (FH-1234) driven by Juhani Lehtonen, a 35-year-old resident of Kivimäentie 123.
* A silver Toyota Corolla (FH-5678) driven by Maria Lindström, a 28-year-old student from Tampere.
* A black Ford Focus (FH-9012) driven by Antti Salmi, a 42-year-old businessman from Helsinki.
* A blue Honda Civic (FH-3456) driven by Leena Kärkkäinen, a 25-year-old nurse from Jyväskylä.
* A red BMW 3 Series (FH-6789) driven by Petri Virtanen, a 38-year-old entrepreneur from Espoo.
* A green Subaru Outback (FH-2345) driven by Sari Puhakka, a 29-year-old teacher from Oulu.
* A yellow Mercedes-Benz C-Class (FH-5678) driven by Jari Lappi, a 45-year-old engineer from Turku.
* A purple Audi A4 (FH-9012) driven by Hanna Mäkelä, a 32-year-old marketing specialist from Vantaa.
* A orange Nissan Sentra (FH-3456) driven by Tommi Kinnunen, a 27-year-old IT specialist from Kuopio.
* A brown Volkswagen Passat (FH-6789) driven by Eero Lehtonen, Juhani's father, a 62-year-old retired teacher from Savo.
* A gray Skoda Octavia (FH-5678) driven by Liisa Salmi, Antti's wife, a 39-year-old homemaker from Helsinki.

The vehicles were traveling in the clockwise direction on Highway 16 when Juhani Lehtonen failed to stop at a red light at the intersection of Kivimäentie. Maria Lindström, who was following Lehtonen, slammed on her brakes to avoid a collision, but lost control of her vehicle and crashed into the white Volkswagen Golf.

The subsequent chain reaction caused by the initial impact resulted in multiple vehicles colliding with each other. Antti Salmi's Ford Focus struck Leena Kärkkäinen's Honda Civic, causing significant damage to both vehicles. Petri Virtanen's BMW 3 Series collided with Hanna Mäkelä's Audi A4, resulting in a broken windshield and minor injuries to the occupants.

Sari Puhakka's Subaru Outback crashed into Tommi Kinnunen's Nissan Sentra, causing a significant dent on the passenger side. Jari Lappi's Mercedes-Benz C-Class struck Eero Lehtonen's Volkswagen Passat, resulting in a cracked windshield and minor damage to the vehicle.

Liisa Salmi's Skoda Octavia was pushed into the gray Audi A4, which had been damaged by Petri Virtanen's BMW 3 Series. The vehicles were all traveling at speeds ranging from 50-70 km/h when the incident occurred.

Weather conditions at the time of the incident were icy, with a temperature of -2°C and visibility of approximately 100 meters. The road surface was slippery, making it difficult for drivers to maintain control of their vehicles.

The scene was processed by our team, and all vehicles involved were safely towed away from the scene. The occupants of each vehicle were provided with medical attention, and several were transported to local hospitals for further treatment.

This incident highlights the importance of safe driving practices, especially during inclement weather conditions. I will be conducting a thorough investigation into the cause of this incident and will provide an update on our findings in due course.
