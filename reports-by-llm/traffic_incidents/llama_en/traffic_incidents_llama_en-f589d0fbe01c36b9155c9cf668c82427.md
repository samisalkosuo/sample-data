Incident Summary:

On July 7th, 2024, at approximately 14:30 hours, a three-vehicle collision occurred on Kruunan-haka Street in Geta Municipality. The incident involved vehicles registered to residents of the area.

Narrative:

The scene was investigated by Officer Juhani Laaksonen (Badge Number: 12345) and witnessed by local resident, Maria Lehtonen. According to eyewitness accounts, the collision occurred when a white Volkswagen Golf (License Plate: FET-456) driven by 32-year-old driver, Antti Salmi, failed to yield to oncoming traffic at the intersection of Kruunan-haka Street and Kaarina Avenue.

As Antti Salmi's vehicle approached the intersection, he was rear-ended by a blue Toyota Corolla (License Plate: HES-789) driven by 28-year-old driver, Sofia Lindström. The impact caused both vehicles to lose control, resulting in a third-party collision with a green Honda Civic (License Plate: KIA-012) driven by 41-year-old driver, Jari Välimaa.

The Honda Civic, which was traveling from the opposite direction, sustained significant damage to its front bumper and hood. The Toyota Corolla suffered minor damage to its rear bumper, while the Volkswagen Golf sustained moderate damage to its front fender and side panel.

Witness Maria Lehtonen reported that the vehicles involved in the collision were traveling at a relatively slow speed, approximately 30 km/h, when the incident occurred. She stated that Antti Salmi's vehicle was not equipped with hazard lights or warning signals, which may have contributed to the severity of the accident.
