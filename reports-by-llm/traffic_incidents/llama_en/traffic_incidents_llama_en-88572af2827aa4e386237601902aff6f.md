Incident Summary:

On July 20, 2025, at approximately 14:45 hours, a traffic collision occurred on Kivisilta Street in Konnevesi Municipality. The incident involved three vehicles and resulted in damage to two of the vehicles.

Narrative:

The incident began when driver, Juhani Laaksonen (born 1980), was traveling northbound on Kivisilta Street in his 2018 Toyota Camry with license plate number FI-123456. Laaksonen was driving at a moderate speed when he failed to notice the vehicle ahead of him, driven by passenger, Sofia Lehtonen (born 1992), who was sitting in the front passenger seat.

Sofia's vehicle, a 2020 Volkswagen Golf with license plate number FI-987654, was traveling eastbound on Kivisilta Street. The driver, Mikael Lindström (born 1985), was not paying attention to the road and failed to yield to Laaksonen's vehicle.

As Sofia's vehicle approached the intersection of Kivisilta Street and Puistokatu Street, it collided with Laaksonen's Toyota Camry. The impact caused significant damage to both vehicles.

Witnesses reported that the incident occurred suddenly and without warning. One witness, passenger, Emma Järvinen (born 1995), who was traveling in the opposite direction on Kivisilta Street, stated: "I saw the two vehicles collide and immediately swerved to avoid the accident. I pulled over to the side of the road and called the police."
