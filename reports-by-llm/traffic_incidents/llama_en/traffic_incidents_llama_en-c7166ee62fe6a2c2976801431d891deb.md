Date: 23.01.2023
Time of Day: Night
Weather Conditions: Wet and Slippery

On January 23rd, 2023, at approximately 02:45 hours, I responded to a report of an accident on Savitaipaleenkatu 12 in Savitaipale. Upon arrival, I observed three vehicles involved in the incident.

The vehicles involved were:

1. A white Toyota Corolla (FCH-123) driven by Juhani Lehtonen, a 35-year-old resident of the address above.
2. A black Volkswagen Golf (GOL-456) driven by Maria Lindström, a 28-year-old student at Savitaipaleen yliopisto.
3. A silver Ford Focus (FOR-789) driven by Antti Kärkkäinen, a 42-year-old delivery driver for a local company.

According to witnesses, the accident occurred when Juhani Lehtonen's Toyota Corolla lost control on the wet and slippery road surface. The vehicle crossed over into the opposite lane, where it collided with Maria Lindström's Volkswagen Golf. Antti Kärkkäinen's Ford Focus was parked at the side of the road and was not involved in the accident.

Witnesses reported that Juhani Lehtonen's Toyota Corolla sustained significant damage to its front bumper and hood. The Volkswagen Golf suffered minor damage to its front fender, while the Ford Focus remained undamaged.

The timeline of events is as follows:

* 02:40 hours: Maria Lindström's Volkswagen Golf was traveling northbound on Savitaipaleenkatu 12.
* 02:42 hours: Juhani Lehtonen's Toyota Corolla passed Maria Lindström's vehicle in the opposite lane.
* 02:43 hours: The Toyota Corolla lost control and crossed over into the opposite lane, where it collided with Maria Lindström's Volkswagen Golf.
* 02:45 hours: Antti Kärkkäinen's Ford Focus was parked at the side of the road when he observed the accident.

Weather conditions at the time of the incident were wet and slippery, with visibility reduced to approximately 100 meters. The road surface was also icy in some areas, contributing to the loss of control by Juhani Lehtonen's vehicle.

All parties involved in the accident appeared to be shaken but uninjured. I issued warnings to both drivers for reckless driving and failure to exercise caution on wet roads.
