Date: 06.09.2023
Time of Day: Night
Weather Conditions: Snowy

On the night of September 6th, 2023, at approximately 23:45 hours, I responded to a report of a multi-vehicle accident on Kouvola Street 12 in Kouvola, Finland. Upon arrival, I observed four vehicles involved in the incident.

The vehicles involved were:

1. A white Volkswagen Passat (license plate: FJK-123) driven by Juhani Laaksonen, a 35-year-old resident of Kouvola.
2. A silver Toyota Corolla (license plate: EHU-456) driven by Maria Lehtonen, a 28-year-old student from Kouvola.
3. A black Ford Focus (license plate: TKA-789) driven by Antti Virtanen, a 42-year-old businessman from Kouvola.
4. A blue Honda Civic (license plate: HSL-321) driven by Sofia Lindström, a 25-year-old nurse from Kouvola.

The accident occurred when Juhani Laaksonen's Volkswagen Passat collided with Maria Lehtonen's Toyota Corolla while both vehicles were traveling in the same direction on Kouvola Street 12. The impact caused both vehicles to swerve into the adjacent lane, where they struck Antti Virtanen's Ford Focus and Sofia Lindström's Honda Civic.

Witnesses reported that Juhani Laaksonen lost control of his vehicle while attempting to pass Maria Lehtonen's Toyota Corolla. The accident occurred on a snowy stretch of road with reduced visibility due to heavy snowfall.

Timeline of Events:

Weather Conditions:

The weather conditions at the time of the incident were snowy with heavy snowfall. The road surface was slippery, and visibility was reduced due to blowing snow. The temperature was around -5°C (23°F), and the wind speed was approximately 15 km/h (9 mph).

Road Conditions:

Kouvola Street 12 is a two-lane road with a speed limit of 80 km/h (50 mph). The road surface was covered in a layer of fresh snow, making it slippery and difficult to control. The snowfall had reduced visibility to around 100 meters (330 feet), making it challenging for drivers to navigate the road.

Damage Description:

All four vehicles involved in the accident sustained significant damage. Juhani Laaksonen's Volkswagen Passat suffered a crushed front bumper and a damaged side mirror. Maria Lehtonen's Toyota Corolla had a cracked windshield and a dented hood. Antti Virtanen's Ford Focus had a broken headlight and a damaged rear bumper. Sofia Lindström's Honda Civic had a shattered windshield and a damaged front fender.

Injuries:

None of the drivers or passengers were injured in the accident. However, witnesses reported that Juhani Laaksonen was shaken but unharmed.

Investigation:

The investigation is ongoing, and I will be reviewing dashcam footage and conducting interviews with all parties involved to determine the cause of the accident.
