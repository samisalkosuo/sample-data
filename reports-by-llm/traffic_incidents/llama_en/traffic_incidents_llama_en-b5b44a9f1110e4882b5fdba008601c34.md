At approximately 23:45 hours on 15th May 2024, a multi-vehicle collision occurred at the intersection of Kruunanranta Avenue and Kruununhaka Street in Varkaus. The incident involved four vehicles, resulting in significant damage and injuries.

Narrative:

The scene was illuminated by flashes of lightning during the thunderstorm, making it difficult for witnesses to see clearly. According to eyewitnesses, driver Juhani Laaksonen (born 1985) from Varkaus was traveling northbound on Kruunanranta Avenue in his 2018 Toyota Hilux truck (license plate: FVX-123). Laaksonen claimed he had stopped at the intersection due to poor visibility.

As Laaksonen waited, driver Maria Lehtonen (born 1992) from Kuopio was traveling eastbound on Kruunanhaka Street in her 2020 Volkswagen Golf (license plate: KUO-456). Lehtonen stated she had not seen Laaksonen's vehicle and continued driving until she reached the intersection.

Unbeknownst to Lehtonen, driver Antti Virtanen (born 1988) from Varkaus was traveling westbound on Kruunanranta Avenue in his 2015 Ford Ranger truck (license plate: FVX-789). Virtanen claimed he had slowed down due to the storm but failed to notice Lehtonen's vehicle approaching.

As Lehtonen entered the intersection, her Golf collided with Virtanen's Ranger. The impact caused both vehicles to swerve and collide with a third vehicle, driven by driver Eero Salmi (born 1975) from Varkaus in his 2012 Peugeot 308 (license plate: FVX-321). Salmi was traveling southbound on Kruunanhaka Street.

The collision resulted in significant damage to all four vehicles. Lehtonen's Golf sustained front-end damage, while Virtanen's Ranger had a crushed rear bumper and dented side panel. Laaksonen's Hilux truck suffered minor scratches, but its tires were blown out due to the impact. Salmi's Peugeot 308 had a cracked windshield and damaged roof.
