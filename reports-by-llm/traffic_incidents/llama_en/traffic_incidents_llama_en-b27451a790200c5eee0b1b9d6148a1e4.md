Summary of Incident:

At approximately 12:45 PM, a two-vehicle collision occurred on Kivimäenkatu in Kangasala. Vehicle 1, driven by Juhani Lehtonen, was traveling southbound on the street when it failed to yield to traffic approaching from the north. Vehicle 2, driven by Maria Salmi, was attempting to merge onto Kivimäenkatu from a side street.

According to witness Petri Mäkelä, "I was walking northbound on the street when I saw one of the cars swerve into my lane. The other car was already in its path, and it seemed like they were going to collide."

Anniina Rissanen, who was also walking northbound at the time, stated, "I heard a loud screeching sound and saw both cars stop suddenly. I didn't see what happened before that, but it looked like they were both trying to avoid each other."

Investigation:

The investigation revealed that Vehicle 1 had failed to yield to traffic approaching from the north, resulting in a collision with Vehicle 2. The speed of both vehicles was estimated to be around 50-60 km/h.

Weather Conditions:

At the time of the incident, the weather conditions were windy with gusts reaching up to 30 km/h. This caused loose debris on the road surface, which may have contributed to the skidding of one or both vehicles.

Road Conditions:

The road surface was wet and slippery due to recent rainfall, which further exacerbated the skidding of the vehicles involved.

Damage Assessment:

Vehicle 1 sustained significant damage to its front bumper and wheel well. Vehicle 2 had minor scratches on its rear bumper.

Injuries:

Neither driver nor passenger reported any injuries as a result of the collision.

Conclusion:

The investigation concluded that the incident was caused by Juhani Lehtonen's failure to yield to traffic approaching from the north. The windy weather conditions and wet road surface contributed to the severity of the skidding involved in the collision.

Recommendations:

1. All drivers are reminded to exercise caution when merging onto busy streets, especially during inclement weather.
2. Vehicle maintenance should be checked regularly to ensure proper tire tread depth and condition.
