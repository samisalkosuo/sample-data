Time of Day: Evening
Location: Kannonkoski, Finland (Kannonkoskentie 123)

On the evening of April 8th, 2025, at approximately 20:45 hours, I responded to a reported vehicle collision on Kannonkoskentie 123 in Kannonkoski. Upon arrival, I observed two vehicles involved in the incident.

The first vehicle, a white Volkswagen Golf ( registration number FI-123456) driven by 32-year-old driver, Antti Lehtonen, was traveling northbound on Kannonkoskentie when it collided with the second vehicle, a silver Ford Focus (registration number FI-987654) driven by 28-year-old driver, Sofia Lindström.

According to witness statements, including those from nearby residents, Juha Mäkelä and Maria Salmi, both vehicles were traveling at moderate speeds when the collision occurred. The Volkswagen Golf was traveling approximately 50 km/h northbound, while the Ford Focus was traveling approximately 40 km/h southbound.

The impact caused significant damage to both vehicles. The front bumper of the Volkswagen Golf was severely damaged, with a large dent and scratches on the surrounding metalwork. The Ford Focus sustained minor damage to its front left corner, with a small scratch on the wheel well.

Witnesses reported that Antti Lehtonen's vehicle swerved onto the opposite lane before colliding with Sofia Lindström's vehicle. It is unclear what caused the swerve, but it appears that both drivers were following standard traffic rules at the time of the incident.

The weather conditions at the scene were clear and sunny, with a temperature of approximately 12°C. The road surface was dry and free of debris, with no signs of oil or other hazardous materials present.

I conducted interviews with both drivers, who reported no injuries sustained during the collision. Antti Lehtonen stated that he had been driving for approximately 30 minutes prior to the incident and had not experienced any issues with his vehicle. Sofia Lindström reported that she had been driving for approximately 20 minutes before the incident and had also not experienced any issues.

I collected evidence from both vehicles, including photographs of the damage, witness statements, and driver's license information. The scene was processed according to standard procedures, and no further incidents were observed during my investigation.
