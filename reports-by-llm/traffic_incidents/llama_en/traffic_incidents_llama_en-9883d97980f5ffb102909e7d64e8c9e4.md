Witness Statement:

A witness, Petri Mäkelä, who was driving behind Antti Salmi's Skoda Octavia, reported that he saw the accident unfold. "I slammed on my brakes to avoid hitting the Volkswagen Golf, which had already skidded into the median," Petri stated. "The Ford Focus was rear-ended by the Skoda Octavia, and I could see Maria Lindström's car swerving all over the road before coming to a stop."

Road Conditions:

The highway was wet and slippery due to the rain that had fallen earlier in the day. The black ice patch where Juhani Lehtonen lost control of his vehicle was particularly hazardous.

Damage Assessment:

* Vehicle 1 (Volkswagen Golf): Minor damage to the front bumper and wheel wells.
* Vehicle 2 (Ford Focus): Rear-end damage, with scratches on the rear bumper and trunk lid. The car's airbag system was activated during the accident.
* Vehicle 3 (Skoda Octavia): Front-end damage, with a crushed hood and minor scratches on the front fender.

Injuries:

None of the occupants were seriously injured in the accident. However, Maria Lindström reported feeling shaken and disoriented after the crash.

Police Investigation:

The police investigation revealed that Juhani Lehtonen's failure to notice the black ice patch was the primary cause of the accident. Antti Salmi's actions in slamming on his brakes were deemed reasonable under the circumstances, but he was issued a warning for reckless driving.

All parties involved have been notified, and they will need to report to the local traffic authority for further investigation and potential fines.
