Incident Report: Accident on Ähtäri-Seppälänkatu, 31.05.2023

Date: 31.05.2023
Time of Day: Evening (18:00-20:00)
Location: Ähtäri-Seppälänkatu, 12345

On the evening of May 31st, 2023, at approximately 19:15 hours, I responded to a report of a three-vehicle accident on Ähtäri-Seppälänkatu. The scene was found to be hazardous due to heavy rain and strong winds associated with a thunderstorm.

The vehicles involved were:

1. A white Volkswagen Golf ( registration number: FIH 123) driven by Mr. Juhani Lehtonen, a 35-year-old resident of Ähtäri.
2. A silver Ford Focus (registration number: FIJ 456) driven by Ms. Sofia Lindström, a 28-year-old student from Ähtäri.
3. A black Toyota Corolla (registration number: FIK 789) driven by Mr. Antti Salmi, a 42-year-old businessman from Ähtäri.

The accident occurred when the Volkswagen Golf, traveling northbound on Ähtäri-Seppälänkatu, failed to yield to traffic approaching from the east on Seppälänkatu. The Ford Focus, driven by Ms. Lindström, was attempting to turn left onto Ähtäri-Seppälänkatu when it was struck by the Volkswagen Golf.

The Toyota Corolla, driven by Mr. Salmi, was traveling behind the Volkswagen Golf and rear-ended it after the collision with the Ford Focus. The impact caused significant damage to all three vehicles.

Witnesses reported that the road conditions were hazardous due to heavy rain and strong winds, which reduced visibility and made it difficult for drivers to control their vehicles. The thunderstorm also caused frequent lightning strikes, which may have contributed to the accident.

The timeline of events is as follows:

* 19:10 hours: Mr. Lehtonen's Volkswagen Golf begins traveling northbound on Ähtäri-Seppälänkatu.
* 19:15 hours: Ms. Lindström's Ford Focus approaches Seppälänkatu from the east and attempts to turn left onto Ähtäri-Seppälänkatu.
* 19:15 hours (approximate): The Volkswagen Golf fails to yield to traffic approaching from the east on Seppälänkatu, striking Ms. Lindström's Ford Focus.
* 19:16 hours: Mr. Salmi's Toyota Corolla begins traveling behind the Volkswagen Golf and rear-ends it after the collision with the Ford Focus.

The vehicles involved sustained significant damage:

* The Volkswagen Golf (FIH 123) suffered extensive front-end damage, including a crushed bumper and damaged headlights.
* The Ford Focus (FIJ 456) had its left front wheel well severely damaged and its front bumper was dented.
* The Toyota Corolla (FIK 789) sustained significant rear-end damage, including a crushed trunk lid and damaged taillights.

All parties involved were shaken but uninjured. I issued warnings to Mr. Lehtonen for failing to yield to traffic approaching from the east on Seppälänkatu and to Ms. Lindström for failing to yield to traffic already on Ähtäri-Seppälänkatu. Mr. Salmi was issued a warning for reckless driving.

The scene was secured, and all parties involved were advised to contact their insurance companies to report the incident. The road was cleared of debris, and normal traffic flow was restored once the storm had passed.
