Incident Report: Pukkila Municipality, Finland - 10.01.2023

Date: 10 January 2023
Time of Day: Night
Location: Kivikatu 12, Pukkila

On the night of 10 January 2023, at approximately 23:45 hours, I responded to a report of a two-vehicle collision on Kivikatu in Pukkila. Upon arrival, I observed that both vehicles had sustained significant damage.

The first vehicle involved was a white Toyota Corolla with Finnish registration plate "KJF 123". The driver, Mr. Antti Lehtonen, a 35-year-old resident of Pukkila, reported that he was driving home from work when his car lost traction on the wet and icy road. He stated that he overcorrected, causing his vehicle to spin out of control and collide with another vehicle.

The second vehicle involved was a black Volkswagen Passat with Finnish registration plate "TKL 456". The driver, Ms. Sofia Jensen, a 28-year-old student from Helsinki, reported that she was driving home from a night shift at a local hospital when her car hydroplaned on the wet road. She stated that she lost control of her vehicle and collided with Mr. Lehtonen's Toyota Corolla.

Witnesses reported that both vehicles came to rest on the side of the road, approximately 50 meters apart. The scene was illuminated by the headlights of passing cars, but visibility was limited due to the heavy snowfall and rain.

Weather Conditions:
The weather at the time of the incident was mixed, with a combination of snow and rain falling from the sky. Visibility was reduced to less than 100 meters, making it difficult for drivers to see the road ahead. The temperature was around -2°C, and the wind speed was approximately 20 km/h.

Road Conditions:
The road surface was wet and icy, with patches of black ice visible in several areas. The snowfall had created a layer of slush on top of the existing ice, making it difficult for tires to grip.

Damage Assessment:
Both vehicles sustained significant damage. Mr. Lehtonen's Toyota Corolla suffered a crushed front bumper, a damaged side mirror, and a cracked windshield. Ms. Jensen's Volkswagen Passat suffered a broken rear bumper, a dented hood, and a shattered windscreen.

Timeline of Events:

* 23:45 hours: Mr. Antti Lehtonen reports the incident to the police.
* 23:50 hours: I arrive on the scene and begin taking statements from witnesses.
* 23:55 hours: Ms. Sofia Jensen arrives at the scene and provides her account of the incident.
* 00:05 hours: Both vehicles are towed to a nearby repair shop for assessment.

Injuries:
Neither driver reported any injuries sustained during the incident.

Causes of the Incident:
The primary cause of the incident was the combination of wet and icy road conditions, which made it difficult for both drivers to maintain control of their vehicles. Contributing factors included excessive speed and inadequate vehicle maintenance.

Recommendations:
It is recommended that both drivers take steps to improve their driving skills, including taking a defensive driving course and ensuring their vehicles are properly maintained.
