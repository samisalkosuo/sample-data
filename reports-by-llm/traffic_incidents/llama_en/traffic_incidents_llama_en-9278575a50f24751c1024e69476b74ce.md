Summary of Incident:

At approximately 14:00 hours on 16.03.2024, two vehicles collided on Kempeleenkatu 12 in Kempele. The incident occurred during a thunderstorm, with heavy rain and strong winds causing reduced visibility.

According to witness accounts, Vehicle 1 (Volkswagen Golf) driven by Mr. Laaksonen was traveling northbound on the street when it failed to stop at a red traffic light.

Weather Conditions:

The thunderstorm caused reduced visibility, with heavy rain and strong winds making it difficult for drivers to see the road ahead. The storm also led to reduced traction on the wet pavement, which may have contributed to Vehicle 1's failure to stop at the red light.

Road Conditions:

Kempeleenkatu 12 was wet and slippery due to the thunderstorm. The street had a layer of standing water, which made it difficult for drivers to maintain control of their vehicles.
