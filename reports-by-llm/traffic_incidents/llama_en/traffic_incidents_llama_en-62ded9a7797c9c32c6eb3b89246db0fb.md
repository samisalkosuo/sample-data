Summary:

On the night of August 8th, 2023, at approximately 23:45 hours, a multi-vehicle collision occurred on Korhonen Street in Kuhmo. The incident involved ten vehicles and resulted in significant damage to property and potential injuries.

Narrative:

The accident began when driver Juhani Laaksonen (born 1985) of vehicle registration number ALK-123 was traveling northbound on Korhonen Street at a speed of approximately 80 km/h. As he approached the intersection with Kivimäentie, his vehicle suddenly swerved to avoid a pedestrian, causing him to lose control.

Laaksonen's vehicle, a 2018 Toyota Corolla (ALK-123), collided with a 2020 Volkswagen Golf (LKS-456) driven by passenger driver, Sofia Lehtonen (born 1992). The impact sent both vehicles careening into the median, where they struck a 2015 Ford Focus (TKS-789) parked on the side of the road.

The subsequent chain reaction involved a 2019 Honda Civic (KTS-012), driven by driver, Antti Kärkkäinen (born 1988), which collided with the Volkswagen Golf. The Honda Civic then struck a 2022 Skoda Octavia (LKS-987) driven by passenger driver, Maria Sillanpää (born 1995).

As the vehicles continued to collide, they also involved a 2017 Kia Rio (TKS-321), driven by driver, Jari Vääränen (born 1982), and a 2020 Nissan Qashqai (ALK-654) driven by passenger driver, Emma Lappalainen (born 1991). The Kia Rio then struck a 2018 Volkswagen Tiguan (LKS-765) parked on the side of the road.

The final vehicle involved in the collision was a 2015 Mercedes-Benz C-Class (TKS-901), driven by driver, Pekka Rissanen (born 1985).

Witnesses reported that the stormy weather conditions, with heavy rain and strong winds, made it difficult to see and navigate the road. The roads were wet and slippery, contributing to the loss of control.
