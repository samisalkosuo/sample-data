Time of Day: Night
Location: Kivipuisto Street, 34500 Humppila

On the night of July 14th, 2024, at approximately 23:45 hours, I responded to a report of a two-vehicle collision on Kivipuisto Street in Humppila. The incident involved two vehicles, a blue Volkswagen Golf (registration number FIH-123) and a black Ford Focus (registration number FIN-456), driven by Juhani Laaksonen and Antti Lehtonen, respectively.

According to witness statements, the collision occurred when the Volkswagen Golf, driven by Mr. Laaksonen, failed to yield to the oncoming traffic on Kivipuisto Street. The Ford Focus, driven by Mr. Lehtonen, was traveling in the opposite direction and attempted to pass the Volkswagen Golf from behind. The two vehicles collided head-on, resulting in significant damage to both vehicles.

Witnesses reported that the scene was illuminated only by the headlights of the vehicles involved, as it was a dark night with clear skies. The road surface was dry but cold, with a temperature of approximately 5째C at the time of the incident. The asphalt was slightly slippery due to the cold weather, which may have contributed to the loss of traction by both drivers.

The Volkswagen Golf sustained significant damage to its front bumper and hood, while the Ford Focus suffered damage to its front fender and grille. Both vehicles were towed from the scene by local towing services.

Mr. Laaksonen and Mr. Lehtonen were both shaken but uninjured in the incident. They exchanged information and provided statements to the investigating officer. The witnesses who reported the incident were identified as Maria Salmi, a resident of 34500 Humppila, and Jari V채limaa, a passerby who was walking home from work.
