Summary:

On August 5th, 2024, at approximately 14:45 hours, a three-vehicle accident occurred on Luhanka Road 1234 in the municipality of Luhanka, Finland. The incident involved vehicles with license plates FI-123456 and FI-987654, which collided with each other due to excessive speed and loss of control.

Narrative:

The accident began when driver Juhani Lehtonen (born 1985) was traveling northbound on Luhanka Road 1234 in his 2018 Volkswagen Golf (FI-123456). Lehtonen was driving at an estimated speed of approximately 80 km/h, which is above the recommended speed limit for this section of road. As he approached the intersection with Luhanka Street 321, he failed to yield to oncoming traffic and collided head-on with a vehicle driven by driver Sofia Jensen (born 1992) in her 2015 Toyota Corolla (FI-987654).

Sofia Jensen was traveling southbound on Luhanka Road 1234 at the same time. Her vehicle was equipped with winter tires, which provided some traction on the wet and slippery road surface. However, the impact from Lehtonen's vehicle caused her car to lose control and collide with a third vehicle, driven by driver Antti Kallio (born 1980) in his 2012 Ford Focus (FI-543210).

Antti Kallio was traveling eastbound on Luhanka Street 321 when Sofia Jensen's vehicle collided with him. The impact caused significant damage to both vehicles and resulted in a multi-vehicle accident.

Witnesses reported that the road surface was wet and slippery due to recent rainfall, which contributed to the loss of control by all three drivers. The accident occurred at approximately 14:45 hours, when the sun was high in the sky.
