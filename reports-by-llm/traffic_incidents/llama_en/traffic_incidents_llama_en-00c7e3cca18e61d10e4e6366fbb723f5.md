Incident Report: M12-2024-07-12

Date: 12 July 2024
Time of Day: Night
Location: Pudasjärvi, Finland (Kirkonkylänkatu 23)

On the night of 12 July 2024, at approximately 02:45 hours, I responded to a report of a multi-vehicle collision on Kirkonkylänkatu in Pudasjärvi. Upon arrival, I observed ten vehicles involved in the incident, with several occupants injured.

The vehicles involved were:

* A white Volkswagen Golf (FH-12321) driven by 32-year-old driver, Antti Lehtonen
* A silver Ford Focus (FH-45678) driven by 28-year-old driver, Sofia Lindström
* A black Toyota Corolla (FH-90123) driven by 45-year-old driver, Juhani Rissanen
* A blue Honda Civic (FH-34567) driven by 25-year-old driver, Elias Kallio
* A red Nissan Sentra (FH-56789) driven by 38-year-old driver, Maria Salmi
* A green Subaru Impreza (FH-90123) driven by 30-year-old driver, Tommi Mäkelä
* A yellow Kia Sportage (FH-45678) driven by 22-year-old driver, Emma Järvinen
* A purple Ford Transit (FH-12321) driven by 40-year-old driver, Pekka Virtanen
* A orange Volkswagen Tiguan (FH-34567) driven by 35-year-old driver, Juha Kolehmainen
* A brown Mercedes-Benz C-Class (FH-56789) driven by 50-year-old driver, Sari Tuomisto

The vehicles were traveling in a northbound direction on Kirkonkylänkatu when the incident occurred. According to witness statements, Antti Lehtonen's Volkswagen Golf was traveling at an excessive speed of approximately 80 km/h in a 50 km/h zone. As he approached the intersection with Koulukatu, he failed to stop at the red light and collided with Sofia Lindström's Ford Focus.

The impact caused both vehicles to swerve into oncoming traffic, where they collided with several other vehicles. The resulting chain reaction involved all ten vehicles, with multiple occupants injured.

Witnesses reported that the weather conditions were windy with gusts of up to 50 km/h, reducing visibility and making it difficult for drivers to maintain control of their vehicles. Road surface conditions were wet due to recent rainfall, which contributed to the loss of traction among the vehicles involved.

The scene was processed by our team, and all occupants were provided with medical attention. The vehicles were towed from the scene, and an investigation is ongoing to determine the cause of the incident.
