Incident Report: Accident on Saarijärvenkatu 12, Saarijärvi

Date: 10.12.2024
Time of Day: Evening (18:00-20:00)
Weather Conditions: Mixed snow and rain

On the evening of December 10th, 2024, at approximately 19:45 hours, I responded to a report of an accident on Saarijärvenkatu 12 in Saarijärvi. Upon arrival, I observed two vehicles involved in the incident.

The first vehicle, a white Toyota Corolla with license plate number AKL-123, was traveling northbound on Saarijärvenkatu when it lost control due to reduced visibility caused by the mixed snow and rain. The driver, 32-year-old Marko Laaksonen from Espoo, failed to negotiate the curve at the intersection of Saarijärvenkatu and Kylmäntie.

The second vehicle, a black Volkswagen Golf with license plate number HSL-456, was traveling southbound on Saarijärvenkatu in the opposite direction. The driver, 41-year-old Sofia Lindström from Helsinki, attempted to pass Marko Laaksonen's vehicle but lost control of her own car when she encountered the skidding Toyota Corolla.

Both vehicles came to a stop on the north side of Saarijärvenkatu, approximately 10 meters apart. The occupants of both vehicles were shaken but uninjured.

Witnesses reported that Marko Laaksonen's vehicle had swerved onto the shoulder before losing control, while Sofia Lindström's vehicle had slowed down significantly before attempting to pass. The mixed snow and rain conditions made it difficult for drivers to see the road ahead.

The accident occurred at 19:45 hours, with the first emergency call received at 19:42 hours. I arrived on the scene at 19:50 hours and began taking statements from witnesses and assessing damage to both vehicles.

Damage Assessment:

* Marko Laaksonen's Toyota Corolla sustained significant damage to the front bumper and wheel wells due to the skid marks left by his vehicle.
* Sofia Lindström's Volkswagen Golf suffered minor scratches on the rear bumper and hood, but no major damage was reported.

Investigation:

I conducted a thorough investigation of the scene, including reviewing dashcam footage from both vehicles. The footage showed that Marko Laaksonen's vehicle had indeed swerved onto the shoulder before losing control, while Sofia Lindström's vehicle had slowed down significantly before attempting to pass.

Based on the evidence collected, it appears that both drivers were at fault for their respective actions leading up to the accident. However, I will need to conduct further investigation and review the dashcam footage again to confirm this assessment.

Conclusion:

The incident on Saarijärvenkatu 12 was caused by a combination of factors, including reduced visibility due to mixed snow and rain, as well as reckless driving behavior by both drivers. Both Marko Laaksonen and Sofia Lindström were issued warnings for their actions, and I will continue to investigate the incident further to determine any additional charges that may be applicable.
