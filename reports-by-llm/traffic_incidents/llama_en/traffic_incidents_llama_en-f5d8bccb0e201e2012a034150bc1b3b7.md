Summary:

On the night of February 5th, 2025, at approximately 23:45 hours, a multi-vehicle collision occurred on Mannerheimintie in Pihtipudas. The incident involved seven vehicles and resulted in significant damage to property.

Narrative:

According to eyewitness accounts, driver Juhani Laaksonen (born 1980) was traveling northbound on Mannerheimintie when his vehicle, a white Toyota Corolla with license plate number FI-123456, lost control due to reduced visibility caused by the fog. The Corolla crossed into the opposite lane and collided head-on with a southbound vehicle, driven by driver Leena Kärkkä (born 1985), who was operating a silver Volkswagen Passat with license plate number FI-987654.

The impact caused both vehicles to swerve off the road, where they struck two additional vehicles: a red Ford Focus driven by driver Antti Virtanen (born 1992) and parked at the side of the road; and a blue Skoda Octavia driven by passenger Maria Lindström (born 1988), who was traveling northbound in the opposite direction.

As a result of the collision, all seven vehicles sustained significant damage. The Toyota Corolla suffered extensive front-end damage, while the Volkswagen Passat had its rear bumper severely damaged. The Ford Focus had its front wheel well crushed, and the Skoda Octavia had its side panel dented.

Witnesses reported that driver Juhani Laaksonen was shaken but uninjured in the incident. Driver Leena Kärkkä suffered minor injuries, including a cut on her forehead. Passenger Maria Lindström also sustained minor injuries, including a bruised shoulder.
