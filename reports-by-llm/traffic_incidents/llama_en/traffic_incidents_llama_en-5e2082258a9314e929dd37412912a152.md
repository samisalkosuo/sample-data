Time of Day: Morning

Weather Conditions: Thunderstorm with heavy rain and strong winds.

Summary:

On 27 January 2023, at approximately 08:45 hours, a traffic collision occurred on Kivikatu in Koski Tl. Four vehicles were involved in the incident, resulting in damage to two of them. The driver of one vehicle was injured, while the occupants of the other three vehicles sustained minor injuries.

Narrative:

The incident began when driver, Juhani Laaksonen (born 1985), operating a blue Volkswagen Golf with license plate number FI-123456, failed to yield to pedestrians crossing the road at Kivikatu and Töölöntie intersection. The pedestrian, Maria Lindström (born 1992), was struck by the vehicle's front bumper.

As Laaksonen attempted to regain control of his vehicle, he lost traction on the wet pavement and collided with a white Toyota Corolla driven by driver, Antti Salmi (born 1988). The impact caused both vehicles to veer off the road, striking a parked silver Honda Civic at Kivikatu 12.

Witnesses reported that Laaksonen's vehicle then spun out of control and crashed into a nearby lamppost. Passengers in Laaksonen's vehicle, including his wife, Sofia Laaksonen (born 1987), and their two children, Emma (age 8) and Lucas (age 5), were shaken but uninjured.

The occupants of the Toyota Corolla, Salmi and his passenger, driver's assistant, Elias Kallio (born 1990), sustained minor injuries. The Honda Civic, which was parked at the scene, suffered significant damage to its front bumper and hood.
