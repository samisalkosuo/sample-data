### **Chief Complaint**  
The patient is a 97-year-old male who presented to the emergency department with a sudden onset of severe chest pain, described as a "tight squeezing" that began approximately 15 minutes prior to arrival. The patient reported that the pain worsened significantly and he was unable to continue exertion.

---

### **History of Present Illness (HPI)**  
The patient is a retired individual with no known medical conditions. He resides alone in a small, quiet home located near a convenience store. On the evening of the incident, the patient fell while attempting to retrieve a package from his hallway. The fall resulted in a direct impact to the left side of his head, causing him to convulse immediately upon conscious awareness. He described the pain as sharp and localized to his chest, which worsened rapidly. No prior medical history or known allergies were provided.

### **Physical Examination Findings**  
Upon arrival, the patient was conscious but appeared agitated due to the sudden onset of symptoms. His vital signs were recorded as follows:  
- Blood pressure: 120/65 mmHg (elevated due to potential orthostatic hypotension or shock)  
- Heart rate: 98 bpm (rapid, consistent with a brain injury or neurological insult)  
- Temperature: 37.2°C (normal but slightly elevated due to vasoconstriction)  

A thorough physical examination revealed the following:  
- A visible laceration on the left forehead, approximately 1 cm in length, caused by the fall.  
- No other injuries were identified during the examination.  
- The patient was oriented and able to provide basic verbal responses.

### **Assessment / Diagnosis**  
Based on the clinical presentation, the primary diagnosis is **status asthmaticus (convulsion) due to brain injury from a fall**. Secondary findings include possible hypovolemia secondary to the fall and potential neurological deficits requiring further evaluation.

---

### **Plan / Treatment**  
The patient will be stabilized with the following measures:  
1. Placement in a quiet, semi-f-private room with soft surfaces to minimize risk of convulsion recurrence.  
2. Administration of oxygen via nasal cannula at 4 L/min to maintain cerebral perfusion and prevent neurological injury.  
3. Immediate control of the laceration on the forehead with gauze and direct pressure application.  
4. Administration of midazolam (0.1 mg) intravenously to reduce convulsions.  
5. Placement in a prone position to minimize risk of further injury or convulsion recurrence.  

The patient will be kept immobile for 2-3 hours until transport to the emergency department is confirmed.

---

### **Follow-up Instructions**  
- The patient should remain at rest and avoid any movement that may trigger convulsions or exacerbate his neurological status.  
- He should avoid alcohol, as it may worsen his condition.  
- If he experiences any signs of respiratory distress, hypotension, or confusion, he should be immediately reassessed.  
- Follow-up will occur within 24 hours to assess the patient’s blood pressure and neurological status.
