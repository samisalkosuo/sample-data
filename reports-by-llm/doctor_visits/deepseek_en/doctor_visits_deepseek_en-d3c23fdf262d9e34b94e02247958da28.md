**Visit Summary**

**Visit Date:** 31.03.2025  
**Clinic Location:** Vöyri  

---

**Chief Complaint:**  
The patient is a 66-year-old male who reports a mild rash on his right arm, which he has noticed over the past few days.

**History of Present Illness (HPI):**  
The rash began approximately three days ago and was first noticed during a family outing. It is located on the patient's right arm, specifically near the elbow area. The rash initially appeared as a small red spot but has since developed into a slightly larger, erythematous patch. No precipitating factors were identified, though the patient noted increased sun exposure during his visit to Vöyri.

**Physical Examination Findings:**  
Upon physical examination, the patient's temperature was normal (36.8°C), and there was no palpable edema in extremities. The rash is tender upon inspection but does not cause any discomfort. No other notable findings were observed during the examination.

**Assessment/Diagnosis:**  
Based on the erythematous rash, the most likely diagnosis is a mild allergic reaction or an allergic dermatitis. This condition typically presents as a patchy rash after environmental exposure to allergens such as pollen, dust, or pet dander.

**Plan/Treatment:**  
The patient will be treated with topical antihistamine cream (e.g., loratadine) applied twice daily for 7 days. The patient is advised to avoid further sun exposure and to monitor the rash for any signs of worsening symptoms. If the rash persists or worsens, the patient should return for reassessment.

**Follow-up Instructions:**  
The patient is scheduled for a follow-up visit in two weeks. During this period, he should monitor the rash for any changes in appearance or severity. If the rash becomes more pronounced, redness, or if it spreads to other areas of the body, the patient should return for further evaluation.
