### **Chief Complaint**
The patient is a 34-year-old female who reports with severe chest pain accompanied by rapid breathing and loss of consciousness. She started feeling unwell approximately 15 minutes prior to arrival, experiencing progressively worsening shortness of breath and then blacking out.

---

### **History of Present Illness (HPI)**
The patient described a sudden onset of symptoms starting about 15 minutes before presentation. She reported feeling fatigued but not otherwise unwell initially. Onset of chest pain was sudden, described as sharp and progressively worsening. She began to feel short of breath within seconds and then blacked out completely upon arrival.

At the time of presentation:
- **Vital Signs:** Blood pressure (BP) 90/60 mmHg, heart rate (HR) 125-140 bpm, oxygen saturation (SpO2) 85% on room air.
- **Symptoms:** Severe chest pain, rapid breathing, loss of consciousness.

---

### **Physical Examination Findings**
The physical examination revealed the following:
- **No自主 circulation (NAC):** No spontaneous breathing or circulation without external intervention.
- **Tachycardia:** Heart rate in the range of 120-140 bpm.
- **BP:** 90/60 mmHg, significantly low for a normal adult.
- **Respiratory Rate:** Rapid (30-40 breaths per minute).
- **No visible signs of shock.**
- **Lack of consciousness:** Patient appeared unresponsive upon arrival.

---

### **Assessment / Diagnosis**
Based on the patient's presentation and immediate clinical findings, the following assessment was made:
1. **Unstable angina with acute onset:** The sudden progression of chest pain suggests a possible coronary artery dissection or related event.
2. **Possible acute cardiac arrest (SCA):** The absence of NAC, tachycardia, and low BP are consistent with an acute cardiac emergency.

---

### **Plan / Treatment**
Immediate resuscitation is required due to the potential life-threatening nature of the patient's condition. The following measures will be taken:
1. **CPR without paddling:** Immediate application of CPR to maintain circulation.
2. **AED use (if available):** If an automated external defibrillator is present, it should be used to restore normal rhythm if a shock is detected.
3. **Synthetic epinephrine administration:** 0.3 mg subcutaneously or intramuscularly to manage potential cardiac arrest.
4. **Blood loss control:** Application of pressure dressings or tourniquet around the affected extremities to prevent excessive bleeding.
5. **Immediate transport to the nearest emergency medical services (EMS) for further evaluation and intervention.**

### **Follow-up Instructions**
- **Avoid exertion:** The patient should avoid any physical activity until cleared by medical staff.
- **Rest in a quiet environment:** The patient should rest quietly at home with no stressors present.
- **Medications:** Continue taking prescribed medications, including beta-blockers to manage underlying conditions.
- **Follow-up appointment:** The patient is scheduled for follow-up at 8:00 AM local time. She will be seen for reassessment of vital signs and further management.

This report reflects the critical need for immediate intervention due to the severity of the patient's condition, which requires resuscitation measures to stabilize her until transport to a higher-level emergency care facility can be arranged.
