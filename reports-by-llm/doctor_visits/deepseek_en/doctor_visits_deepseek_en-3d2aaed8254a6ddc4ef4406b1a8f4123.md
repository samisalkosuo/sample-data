**Visit Date:** 08.03.2025  
**Clinic or Hospital Location:** Sauvo

### **Chief Complaint**
The patient is a 98-year-old male who presented with shortness of breath (SOS) over the past 12 hours, exacerbated by exertion. He reported difficulty breathing both during rest and activity, along with a persistent chest pain that started several weeks ago.

---

### **History of Present Illness (HPI)**
The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which has been stable for 15 years. Onset of symptoms began approximately two months ago, initially as mild dyspnea on exertion, which progressed to full-blown respiratory failure requiring oxygen therapy in December 2024. He denies recent trauma or infection but reports occasional confusion over the past year.

### **Physical Examination Findings**
- **General:** Vital signs indicate optimal cardiovascular and respiratory status (BP: 135/85 mmHg, HR: 78 bpm, RR: 16, T: 99°F). No palpable tachycardia or cyanosis.
- **Chest:** Auscultation reveals wheezing bilaterally on effort but no crackles or rales. No evidence of edema in the extremities.
- **Lungs:** Clear to auscultation bilaterally, with no wheezing or crackles noted.
- **Upper Extremities:** Mildly elevated jugular venous distension (JVD) on compression; no peripheral edema.
- **Lower Extremities:** No edema noted. Pulsatile radial and ulnar arteries are intact.

### **Assessment/Diagnosis**
Based on the patient’s presentation, history of COPD, and physical examination findings, the primary diagnosis is **unstable pulmonary congestion due to advanced COPD**. The mild JVD observed bilaterally suggests pre-existing heart failure or valvular regurgitation, which may be contributing to the respiratory symptoms.

---

### **Plan/Treatment**
- **Medications:** Continue current COPD medications (e.g., albuterol, levothyroxine) and oxygen therapy as needed.
- **Procedures/Recommendations:**
  - Monitor for signs of pulmonary congestion on future episodes.
  - Refer to a cardiology specialist for further evaluation of valvular regurgitation or heart failure.
  - Provide reassurance and encourage home exercise under medical supervision.

### **Follow-up Instructions**
The patient will be followed up in two weeks for reassessment. If symptoms persist, he should return to the clinic immediately. Home care instructions include staying hydrated, avoiding excessive fluid intake, and continuing COPD therapy as prescribed.
