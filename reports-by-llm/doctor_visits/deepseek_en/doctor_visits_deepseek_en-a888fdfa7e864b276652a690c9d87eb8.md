**Visit Summary**

**Visit Date:** 19.07.2025  
**Clinic or Hospital Location:** Hausj√§rvi  

---

### **Chief Complaint**
The patient is a 91-year-old female who presents with complaints of fatigue, shortness of breath at rest, and orthopnea (shortness of breath on standing). She has been experiencing these symptoms for approximately two weeks. The patient denies any chest pain or other acute symptoms.

### **History of Present Illness (HPI)**
The patient is a retired individual with a history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus managed with lifestyle modifications, including diet and regular exercise. She has no known cardiovascular events in the past decade but reports using diuretics for weight management over the past five years. On presentation, she states that her potassium levels have recently increased to 4.2 mmmol/L, which she attributes to the use of these diuretics.

She denies any recent trauma or infections and reports no history of heart disease or chronic kidney disease. She is currently taking a combination of beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors for her hypertension but has not discussed potassium management with her healthcare provider.

### **Physical Examination Findings**
The patient appears normothermic, with no palpitations or signs of arrhythmia on auscultation. Her blood pressure measures 130/85 mmHg, slightly elevated compared to baseline. She reports a moderate increase in peripheral edema (legs), which is consistent with fluid retention from diuretics.

Her respiratory rate is 20 breaths per minute, and she has mild crackles in the lower lung zones on auscultation. There are no signs of acute distress or shock. Her cardiovascular exam reveals a regular pulse rate of 78 beats per minute and normal heart sounds with S3 gallops heard at the apex.

### **Assessment/Diagnosis**
Based on her presentation, fluid retention from diuretics is the most likely cause of her peripheral edema. However, given her history of hypertension and the increased potassium levels noted during the visit, further evaluation is warranted to rule out acute decompensated heart failure or electrolyte imbalances.

### **Plan / Treatment**
1. **Immediate Intervention:**  
   - Initiate intravenous fluids at a rate of 25 mL/kg/hour for fluid resuscitation (aiming for a target blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg).  
   - Correct potassium levels to normal range (36-42 mmmol/L) using oral or intravenous potassium chloride as needed.  

2. **Electrolyte Studies:**  
   - Order a comprehensive blood panel to assess kidney function, electrolytes, and glucose levels.

3. **Medical Management:**  
   - Review current diuretic regimen with her healthcare provider to optimize fluid management while monitoring for adverse effects (e.g., hyperkalemia).  
   - Consider initiation of beta-blocker or ACE inhibitor therapy if contraindicated by current treatment.

4. **Monitoring:**  
   - Document the patient's response to fluids and electrolyte correction in a care report before discharge.

### **Follow-up Instructions**
- The patient will be seen by her primary healthcare provider within 2 weeks for further evaluation and management.
- She is advised to monitor her potassium levels closely at home if possible. If she is unable to manage her symptoms independently, she should return to the clinic promptly.
- Lifestyle modifications, such as increased fluid intake in moderation and regular exercise, are recommended to help manage any underlying conditions.
