### **Assessment/Diagnosis**
Based on the patient's presentation and physical examination findings, the primary diagnosis is **acute chest pain due to a massive pulmonary embolism (MPE)**. The elevated heart rate and blood pressure are consistent with vasoactive symptoms, but no immediate tachycardia or hypotension was observed.

Additional considerations include:
- **Chronic Heart Disease:** The patient's history of hypertension and diabetes places her at high risk for acute MI.
- **Alcohol Consumption:** The recent alcohol intake may contribute to the presentation.
- **Fever:** The low-grade fever could be related to an underlying infection or a separate cause.
