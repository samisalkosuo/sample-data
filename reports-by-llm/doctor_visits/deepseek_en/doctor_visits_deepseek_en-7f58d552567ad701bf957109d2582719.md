- **Respiratory System:** No wheezing, crackles, or other abnormal findings.
- **Abdomen:** Inspection revealed mild tenderness at the left lower quadrant (LLQ), likely related to disc degeneration. Auscultation bilaterally was normal. No masses or edema noted.

### **Assessment/Diagnosis**
Based on the patient’s complaints and physical examination findings, the following diagnoses were made:
1. **Hypertension** (diagnosed based on elevated blood pressure and family history).
2. **Diabetic Neuropathy** (uggested due to age-related changes in extremities and baseline glucose control).
3. **Disc Degeneration** (present at LLQ, contributing to low back pain and headaches).

### **Plan / Treatment**
- **Medications:**
  - **Hypertension:** Continue with Metformin 500 mg twice daily to control blood pressure.
  - **Diabetic Neuropathy:** Initiate ointment therapy (e.g., 1% buspirone) and monitor for progression. If symptoms worsen, insulin therapy may be considered.
- **Procedures:**
  - Conservative management of disc degeneration with rest and activity modification.
- **Follow-Up:** Blood pressure monitoring at home will continue to assess the effectiveness of treatment.

### **Follow-up Instructions**
1. **Next Follow-up:** Schedule a follow-up appointment in 4 weeks to review symptoms, blood pressure, and any changes in neuropathy.
2. **Medication Review:** Bring a list of all prescribed medications for review during the next visit.
3. **Disc Issues:** If symptoms worsen or become unmanageable, further evaluation may be needed.
4. **Blood Glucose Check:** Continue monitoring blood glucose levels to ensure control of diabetic neuropathy.
