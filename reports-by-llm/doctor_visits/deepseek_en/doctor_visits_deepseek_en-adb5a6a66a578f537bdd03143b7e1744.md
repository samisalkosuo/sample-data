---

### **History of Present Illness (HPI)**

### **Physical Examination Findings**
- **Vital Signs:** Blood pressure (180/95 mmHg), heart rate (120 bpm, tachycardic), respiratory rate (30 breaths/min, hyperpnea), temperature (36.8°C).
- **Airway:** Clear to auscultation bilaterally; no evidence of edema or wheezing.
- **Chest:** Mild crackling sound on auscultation bilaterally, indicative of pulmonary congestion.
- **Extremities:** Edema noted in the lower extremities (legs and feet), with no peripheral edema in the upper extremities.
- **Lungs:** Clear to auscultation except for decreased breath sounds at the bases due to hypoventilation.
- **Abdomen:** Soft, non-tender abdomen; no signs of hepatosplenomegaly.

### **Assessment/Diagnosis**
Based on the patient's presentation and physical examination findings, the primary diagnosis is **acute hypoxia secondary to acute respiratory failure**. Secondary findings include mild pulmonary congestion and decreased breath sounds at the bases due to hypoventilation.

---

### **Plan/Treatment**
- **Immediate Interventions:** Intubation of the airway with a tracheal tube secured in place.
- **Oxygen Therapy:** Initiation of high-flow oxygen therapy (HFOT) via nasal cannula at 8 L/min, titrated to maintain normocapnia.
- **Vasopressor Therapy:** Administration of vasoactive drugs (e.g., dopamine or nitroprusside) to control pulmonary congestion and improve gas exchange.
- **IV Fluids:** Intravenous rehydration with normal saline solution at a rate of 150 mL/hour.
- **Monitoring:** Continuous monitoring of vital signs, airway patency, and oxygen saturation.

### **Follow-up Instructions**
The patient will be seen in the emergency department within 2 hours. Please bring all medical documentation for review, including the airway tube, tracheal tube, and any medications prescribed. The following day, she should avoid strenuous activity and return to report any worsening symptoms or signs of respiratory improvement.
