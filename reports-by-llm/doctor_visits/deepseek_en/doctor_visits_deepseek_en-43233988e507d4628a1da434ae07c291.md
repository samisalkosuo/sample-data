### **Chief Complaint**
The patient is a 45-year-old male who presented to the emergency department with complaints of severe chest pain that started approximately 3 hours prior to arrival. The pain began gradually and worsened significantly, reaching a peak when he was sitting and after exertion. He reported no history of heart disease or chest pain in the past year.

---

### **History of Present Illness (HPI)**
The patient described the pain as sharp and radiating down his left arm, which worsened with increased activity. He stated that it started after eating a large meal containing fatty foods and was exacerbated by stress during a recent work meeting. He denied any shortness of breath or other symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, or sweating.

The patient reported no history of heart disease, diabetes, or smoking. He mentioned that he typically eats a balanced diet but noted that he had consumed approximately 3,000 calories the night before, which he believed might have contributed to his discomfort.

### **Physical Examination Findings**
Upon arrival, the patient was oriented and alert but appeared distressed with tachycardia (120 bpm) and increased heart sounds. He reported a dry mouth and mild edema in his extremities, possibly due to fluid retention from dehydration or shock. His blood pressure was 140/90 mmHg, and he had no signs of cyanosis.

### **Assessment / Diagnosis**
Based on the patientâ€™s presentation, the primary diagnosis considered was an acute myocardial infarction (STEMI) or severe angina pectoris. The tachycardia, edema, and lack of oxygenation on auscultation suggested possible left ventricular dysfunction. Further imaging studies would be required to confirm the diagnosis.

---

### **Plan / Treatment**
The immediate plan included:
1. **Medications:**
   - Intravenous (IV) beta-blocker to control tachycardia and reduce myocardial workload.
   - Low-dose anticoagulant (e.g., warfarin) to prevent thromboembolic events, given the potential for recent risk factors or pre-existing conditions.

2. **Procedures:**
   - Placement of a Foley catheter to drain fluid from the left arm due to edema.
   - IV fluids at 100 mL/hour to replete intracellular and extracellular fluid levels.

3. **Recommendations:**
   - Immediate avoidance of heavy meals or stressors that could trigger further symptoms.
   - Monitoring for signs of worsening condition, such as increased heart rate, respiratory distress, or chest pain.

### **Follow-up Instructions**
The patient is scheduled for a follow-up in 24 hours to review treatment progress and discuss medication adjustments. He should return with any signs of worsening symptoms or new symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, or shortness of breath.

Additionally, the patient is advised to avoid heavy meals and maintain a low-stress lifestyle until cleared by the attending physician.
