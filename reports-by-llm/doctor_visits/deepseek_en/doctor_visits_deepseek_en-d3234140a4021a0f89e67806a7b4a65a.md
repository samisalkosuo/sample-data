### **Chief Complaint**  
The patient is a 34-year-old female who presented with a burning sensation on her right arm, which began approximately two days prior to the visit. She described it as itchy and painful and noted that it worsened over the weekend.

### **History of Present Illness (HPI)**  
The patient reported experiencing a small red rash on her right arm, located near the elbow area, which she had noticed about 48 hours prior to the visit. The rash was approximately 2 cm in diameter and appeared asymmetrical, with one side being slightly larger than the other. She stated that it had been itchy and uncomfortable to touch, and she had applied some calamine lotion locally a few days ago without improvement. She also mentioned experiencing mild fever (37.5°C) and fatigue during the evening of her onset.

No significant trauma or exposure was reported by the patient. She denied any history of allergies, cuts, burns, or other skin conditions. She stated that she had not consumed any medications in the past week and maintained a regular sleep schedule.

### **Physical Examination Findings**  
Upon arrival, the patient appeared slightly flushed and reported mild elevated heart rate (98 bpm) during the examination. Her systemic examination revealed no palpable tenderness or signs of infection. The rash on her right arm was the only notable finding, located approximately 10 cm below the armpit, with no other visible lesions.

The skin on the affected area was red and slightly raised, with minimal erythema noted around the base of the rash. No palpitations or other concerning signs were observed during the physical examination.

### **Assessment / Diagnosis**  
Based on the patient’s presentation, history, and physical examination findings, the primary diagnosis considered is a mild allergic reaction or skin irritation likely related to her recent application of calamine lotion. No systemic symptoms or signs of an allergic reaction (e.g., respiratory distress) were identified.

No other medical conditions requiring immediate attention were noted at this time.

2. **Home Care:**  
   - Continue using calamine lotion as directed for at least 48 hours.
   - Monitor for any worsening symptoms, such as increased itching, fever, or fatigue.

3. **Follow-Up:**  
   - The patient is advised to return for a follow-up visit within 48 hours if the rash does not improve or if she experiences any signs of worsening symptoms (e.g., severe itching, fever, or systemic symptoms).

### **Follow-Up Instructions**  
- Monitor the rash for improvement and any signs of worsening symptoms.
- If the rash remains unchanged after 24 hours or if she experiences fever, fatigue, or other concerning symptoms, return to the clinic for further evaluation.
- Inform the healthcare provider if the rash worsens, changes in temperature, or new symptoms develop.
