**Visit Summary**

**Visit Date:** 04.06.2024  
**Clinic Location:** Kitee  

---

**Chief Complaint:**  
The patient is a 40-year-old male who presented with chest pain radiating to his jaw, described as squeezing and pressure on the left side of his torso. The onset was sudden, following a period of stress at work.

**History of Present Illness (HPI):**  
The patient reported significant shortness of breath, which began three hours prior to the visit. He stated that exerting himself physically worsened the symptoms. No recent fever or weight loss was noted. He denied chest discomfort beyond the initial pain and no history of heart disease.

**Physical Examination Findings:**  
Upon arrival, the patient appeared slightly pale with a tachycardic heart rate (108 bpm) and increased breathing rate (24 breaths per minute). He reported feeling fatigued but not overly tired. No palpitations or signs of distress were observed during examination.

**Assessment/Diagnosis:**  
Based on the patient's presentation, the primary diagnosis is acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), likely secondary to fluid overload in the lungs from recent exertion and stress.

**Plan/Treatment:**  
- **Medications:** IV fluids at 250 mL/hour, oxygen therapy at 10 LPM via nasal cannula.  
- **Procedures:** Blood tests for metabolic workup (high chloride level noted).  
- **Recommendations:** Rest, avoid further exertion, and monitor symptoms closely.

**Follow-up Instructions:**  
The patient should return in one week for reassessment and imaging studies. Please bring any new symptoms or changes in condition to the next follow-up.
