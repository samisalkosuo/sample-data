**Visit Summary**

**Visit Date:** October 3, 2024  
**Clinic Location:** Hirvensalmi  
**Severity Level:** 2 (Emergent – potential life threat)  

---

### **Chief Complaint**
The patient is a 9-year-old female who presented with a severe rash on her arms and legs. She described the rash as itchy, red, and spreading rapidly across multiple body areas.

---

### **History of Present Illness (HPI)**
The patient reported experiencing the rash approximately 2 hours prior to the visit. She stated that she had been exposed to allergens such as pollen and household dust mites. She mentioned that the rash started on her arms and quickly spread to her legs, face, and even her back. She described the rash as itchy and uncomfortable, which became progressively worse over time. She reported no prior history of similar rashes or allergies.

---

### **Physical Examination Findings**
Upon arrival, the patient appeared visibly distressed with a tachycardia (heart rate around 120 beats per minute) and pale skin due to increased blood flow from the rash. Her respiratory rate was elevated at 30 breaths per minute, indicating possible breathing difficulties. The rash was widespread across her arms, legs, face, and upper body. She exhibited signs of distress, including difficulty breathing and a cool extremity.

---

### **Assessment / Diagnosis**
The patient’s presentation raised concerns for an allergic reaction or skin irritation. Given the severity of her rash and potential for spreading, she was immediately referred to the emergency department. A thorough clinical evaluation confirmed the diagnosis of possible anaphylaxis due to an unknown allergen exposure. The rash was consistent with a systemic allergic reaction.

---

### **Plan / Treatment**
The patient was admitted to the pediatric emergency care unit. She received intravenous fluids and oxygen therapy to address acute hypoxia and shock. She was given epinephrine subcutaneously as a precautionary measure, which she later reported experiencing a mild allergic reaction (e.g., itching at the site of injection). The patient was monitored closely for signs of anaphylactic shock, including difficulty breathing or severe rash spreading.

---

### **Follow-up Instructions**
The patient will be discharged from the hospital with close monitoring. She is instructed to stay in the pediatric ward overnight and to report any worsening symptoms immediately. Following treatment, she should undergo a skin prick test at her next appointment to confirm the diagnosis of an allergic reaction. If no reaction occurs, she may receive allergy shots as needed.

---

### **Note on Patient’s Condition**
The patient’s condition is improving with supportive care, but she remains under medical supervision due to the potential severity of her allergic reaction. Further follow-up will be required based on her response to treatment and subsequent symptoms.
