**Visit Summary Report**

**Visit Date:** September 21, 2024  
**Clinic Location:** Savitaipale  

---

### **Chief Complaint**
The patient is a 65-year-old male who presented to the clinic with complaints of persistent chest discomfort that radiates to his arm. The patient described the discomfort as causing fatigue and shortness of breath, which began three days prior after he experienced a cough from a recent cold.

---

### **History of Present Illness (HPI)**
The patient reported that the onset of symptoms occurred approximately three days ago following a cough from a respiratory infection. He initially felt better but has been progressively worsening since then. The chest discomfort is described as intermittent and fluctuating in severity, with no associated nausea or vomiting. The patient denies any recent trauma or significant changes in his lifestyle.

### **Physical Examination Findings**
Upon arrival, the patient appeared slightly palpable and was oriented and alert. His vital signs were within normal limits at presentation (104/68 mmHg, 98°F, 75 mg/dL). He denied any history of heart disease or diabetes but reported a history of hypertension from approximately five years prior.

The physical examination revealed mild respiratory distress with crackles in the bilateral upper lung zones. There was no evidence of wheezing or productive cough on auscultation bilaterally. The patient’s breath sounds were diminished at the apex, and he had minimal crackling at the bases. No signs of acute hypoxia or tachycardia were observed.

### **Assessment/Diagnosis**
Based on the patient’s chief complaint, history of present illness, physical examination findings, and vital signs, the primary diagnosis is **acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)** with mild pulmonary congestion. The absence of acute kidney injury symptoms suggests that this is a secondary ARDS process likely related to an underlying cardiogenic cause.

Additional findings include:
- Mildly elevated heart rate (98°F) without tachycardia.
- No evidence of hypoxemia or respiratory failure on room air.

---

### **Plan / Treatment**
The immediate plan involves:
1. **IV fluids** to reduce pulmonary congestion and restore intravascular volume.
2. **Oxygen therapy** if the patient’s oxygen saturation drops below 90% on room air (to be determined at the next follow-up).
3. **Monitoring of vital signs**, including blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation.

The patient will be referred to the cardiology team for further evaluation of the underlying cause of ARDS.

---

### **Follow-Up Instructions**
The patient is scheduled for a follow-up in approximately one week to reassess his symptoms and evaluate the effectiveness of the IV fluids. If his condition does not improve, additional interventions may be considered.
