The patient is a 15-year-old male who presented with a complaint of pain in the left ankle.

**History of Present Illness (HPI):**  
The patient reported experiencing pain localized to his left ankle after an incident involving playing sports. The pain was accompanied by mild swelling and tenderness at the site, which occurred after he climbed stairs. No significant history of prior injuries or chronic conditions was provided.

**Assessment / Diagnosis:**  
The patient's complaint of pain in the left ankle is classified as a less urgent issue. No immediate life-threatening signs were identified, such as acute respiratory distress or cardiac arrest. The most likely diagnosis is a sprained ankle (扭伤), without any evidence suggesting a fracture.

**Plan / Treatment:**
