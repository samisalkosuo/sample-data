### **Chief Complaint**
The patient is a 56-year-old female who presented with a complaint of mild itching on her arms and legs. She noted that the itching began after she left town last weekend without using sunscreen, possibly due to exposure to pollen.

### **History of Present Illness (HPI)**
The patient reported mild erythema (redness) localized to her extremities, which started approximately 3 days prior. The itching was intermittent and did not cause any distress or discomfort beyond the skin surface. No other symptoms were reported during the visit.

### **Physical Examination Findings**
Upon examination, the patient had normal vital signs with a slightly elevated blood pressure (140/95 mmHg) due to mild stress from the visit. The extremities showed erythema without burns or swelling. No systemic symptoms or signs of infection were observed.

### **Assessment / Diagnosis**
The diagnosis was considered to be a mild allergic reaction or contact dermatitis, likely related to environmental factors such as pollen exposure. No emergency intervention was deemed necessary.

### **Plan / Treatment**
- **Topical Therapy:** Prescribed hydrocortisone 0.5% cream (10g) for localized inflammation reduction.
- **Home Care:** Recommended use of antihistamines (e.g., loratadine) if itching persists beyond 48 hours.

### **Follow-up Instructions**
The patient was advised to monitor her symptoms and return in one week if the itching persists. No further hospitalization or testing is anticipated due to the non-urgent nature of the complaint.
