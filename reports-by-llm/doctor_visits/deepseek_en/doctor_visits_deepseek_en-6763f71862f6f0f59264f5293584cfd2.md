### **Physical Examination Findings**
Upon examination, the patient’s vital signs were within normal limits (BP: 120/80 mmHg, HR: 78 bpm). The skin at the affected area showed a small erythematous patch (1 cm in diameter), which was tender to the touch. No other notable findings were observed during the physical examination.

### **Assessment / Diagnosis**
The primary diagnosis based on the patient’s presentation and clinical findings is **mild contact dermatitis** or possibly **allergic reaction**, given the localized nature of the rash. No systemic symptoms, such as fever, cough, or fatigue, were present to suggest a more serious condition.

### **Plan / Treatment**
1. **Diagnosis:** Confirmatory evaluation through a skin prick test for potential allergies.
2. **Home Care:**
   - Use mild, fragrance-free soap and hypoallergenic fabrics for the affected area.
   - Avoid irritants (e.g., scented products) in the vicinity of the rash.
3. **Monitoring:** The patient is advised to monitor the rash for any signs of worsening or recurrence.

### **Follow-up Instructions**
The patient should return for a follow-up visit within 1 week if the rash persists, worsens, or if any systemic symptoms arise. If no changes are observed, he may be considered cleared without further intervention.
