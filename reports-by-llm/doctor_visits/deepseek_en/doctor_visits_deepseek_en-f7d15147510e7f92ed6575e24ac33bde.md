### **Chief Complaint**  
The patient, a 55-year-old female, presented to the clinic with a severe headache that began approximately 4 hours prior to the visit. She described it as "searing" and noted that it had worsened significantly in the past 30 minutes. She also reported dizziness, which she described as "moderate," and mentioned that she feels "unstable."

### **History of Present Illness (HPI)**  
The patient has a history of hypertension and diabetes, both of which are known risk factors for migraines. On presentation, she stated that her headache is typically precipitated by bright light or physical exertion. She also mentioned that she experiences sensitivity to sound and light during episodes. The headache is described as "intense" with associated nausea and a fluctuating heart rate. No history of fever, rash, or other systemic symptoms was reported.

### **Physical Examination Findings**  
Upon arrival, the patient appeared fatigued and slightly disoriented. Her vital signs were stable: blood pressure 130/85 mmHg, pulse 88 bpm, respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and temperature 98.6°F (37°C). She reported a dry mouth and was conscious without confusion. No acute distress or signs of shock were observed.

### **Assessment / Diagnosis**  
Based on the patient's presentation, the primary diagnosis is a severe migraine with aura. The aura component appears to be triggered by the onset of the headache. Given her age, hypertension, and diabetes, these conditions are contributing factors. No acute life-threatening signs were identified during the examination.

### **Plan / Treatment**  
1. **Immediate Treatment:**  
   - Administer oral rehydration solution (e.g., Pedialyte) to address possible dehydration from excessive sweating due to the migraine.  
   - Prescribe ibuprofen to alleviate headaches and reduce sensitivity to light and sound.  
   - Monitor vital signs closely for any signs of hypotension or tachycardia, which could indicate a pre-migraine crisis.  

2. **Follow-Up:**  
   - Schedule a follow-up in 1-2 hours to reassess symptoms and ensure they have subsided.  
   - If no improvement is noted within 30 minutes, discontinue treatment and refer the patient to an emergency department for further evaluation.

### **Follow-up Instructions**
