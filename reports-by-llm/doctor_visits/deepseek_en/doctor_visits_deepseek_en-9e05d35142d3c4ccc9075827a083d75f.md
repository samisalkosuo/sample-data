### **Chief Complaint**
The patient is a 105-year-old female presenting with severe difficulty breathing and chest pain, exacerbated by the administration of her prescribed antihistamines for seasonal allergies. She reports experiencing a rapid onset of symptoms, including a red, itchy rash over her face and neck.

---

### **History of Present Illness (HPI)**
The patient has been taking oral antihistamines for approximately 10 years to manage her seasonal allergy symptoms. On the morning of the visit, she experienced a sudden worsening of her allergy symptoms, which began with a brief episode of difficulty breathing and chest pain. She described the rash as spreading rapidly across her face and neck, accompanied by an itchy sensation that became increasingly uncomfortable.

The patient reported that her breathing has become labored and irregular, and she is unable to continue taking her antihistamines due to the severity of her symptoms. She also mentioned that her blood pressure has spiked slightly above 140/90 mmHg during the episode, which she attributes to the allergic reaction.

### **Physical Examination Findings**
Upon arrival, the patient was conscious and alert but appeared significantly dehydrated with a dry mucous membranes. Her systemic blood pressure was elevated at 150/95 mmHg, and her heart rate was rapid (120 bpm), suggesting possible pre-existing cardiovascular conditions. She denied any shortness of breath or chest pain prior to this episode.

Lung auscultation revealed wheezing and crackles in the upper lung zones, consistent with an allergic reaction. The patient’s face and neck were red and itchy, with no evidence of systemic rash beyond these areas. No signs of hypoxia or respiratory distress were observed during the physical examination.

### **Assessment / Diagnosis**
Based on the patient’s history, presentation, and physical findings, the primary diagnosis is **severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis)** complicated by a pre-existing cardiovascular condition. The rapid onset of symptoms, including anaphylactic rash and respiratory distress, along with her antihistamine use, strongly suggests an allergic reaction. Additionally, the patient’s elevated blood pressure and rapid heart rate raise suspicion for a concurrent cardiovascular event.

### **Plan / Treatment**
1. **Immediate Treatment:**  
   - Administer epinephrine subcutaneously or intravenously to address the severe allergic reaction. The healthcare provider will monitor her condition closely.
   
2. **Underlying Condition Management:**  
   - Advise the patient to discontinue use of antihistamines immediately and consider switching to a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) for future allergy management, if appropriate.

3. **Follow-Up:**  
   - Schedule a follow-up in 2-3 days to reassess her condition and ensure there are no complications from the allergic reaction or cardiovascular event.
   
4. **Additional Monitoring:**  
   - The patient will be closely monitored for any signs of respiratory distress or hypotension, which could indicate a worsening cardiovascular event.

### **Follow-up Instructions**
1. **Avoid Further Antihistamines:** The patient should discontinue use of her antihistamines immediately and avoid exposure to other allergens until she has fully recovered.
   
2. **Recheck Condition:** Follow up in 2-3 days to ensure there are no ongoing symptoms or complications.

3. **Review Medications:** Discuss the need for any adjustments to her medications, including the switch to an NSAID if appropriate.

4. **Cardiovascular Monitoring:** The healthcare provider will continue to monitor the patient’s cardiovascular status and consider whether additional management is required due to the pre-existing condition.

This comprehensive approach aims to address both the immediate allergic reaction and any underlying cardiovascular concerns, ensuring the patient receives appropriate care for her current episode while managing her long-term health.
