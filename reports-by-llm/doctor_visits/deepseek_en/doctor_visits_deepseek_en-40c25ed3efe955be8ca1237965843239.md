**Visit Summary**

**Visit Date:** 25.07.2025  
**Clinic Location:** Konnevesi  

---

### **Chief Complaint**
The patient is a male, 102 years old, who presented with a "mild rash on his arm" as his primary reason for visiting the clinic.

---

### **History of Present Illness (HPI)**
The patient described a localized, itchy rash that began approximately two days prior to the visit. The rash appeared in the affected area and spread slightly upon examination. It was described as red and tender, with no associated pain or discomfort. The patient noted that the rash had not been present previously and had worsened over the past 24 hours. No other symptoms, such as fever, fatigue, or dyspnea, were reported.

---

### **Physical Examination Findings**
Upon physical examination, the patient was alert and oriented to person, time, and setting. No acute distress or distress-related comorbidities were observed. The rash was tender but not painful, located in the affected area of the arm. It improved slightly with a cool compress applied directly to the site. No other significant findings were noted.

### **Assessment / Diagnosis**
Based on the patient's presentation and examination findings, the primary diagnosis considered was a "localized pruritus" (itching) likely caused by environmental factors or an allergic reaction. Given the patient's advanced age, pruritus interruptus (itching without rash) could also be contributing to his discomfort.

---

### **Plan / Treatment**
The treatment plan includes:
1. Prescribe a topical antihistamine to alleviate itching and reduce the severity of the rash.
2. Schedule a follow-up visit in two weeks to reassess the condition and adjust treatment as needed.

No significant intervention or procedure is required at this time.

---

### **Follow-up Instructions**
The patient should return for a follow-up appointment in approximately two weeks to evaluate the improvement of the rash and adjust treatment accordingly. If no resolution occurs, further investigation may be warranted.
