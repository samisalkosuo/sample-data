2. **Over-the-Counter (OTC) Measures:**  
   - Advise the patient to take acetaminophen (Paracetamol) 650 mg every 4-6 hours for pain and fever relief, if any develop over the next 24 hours.  

3. **Follow-Up:**  
   - Schedule a follow-up consultation in 24-48 hours to reassess symptoms and treatment response.
