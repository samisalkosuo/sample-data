### **Assessment / Diagnosis**
Based on the patient’s presentation, the primary diagnosis is a persistent cough secondary to reactivation of chickenpox.

   - Over-the-counter (OTC) antihistamines for potential allergy symptoms if mucus is thick or yellow.

### **Follow-up Instructions**
- Follow up with the healthcare provider on day 7 to assess the severity of symptoms.
