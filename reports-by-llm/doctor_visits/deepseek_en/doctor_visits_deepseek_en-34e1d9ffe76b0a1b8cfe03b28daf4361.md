**Chief Complaint:** The patient is a 6-year-old male who presented with a persistent cough that began two days ago. He experiences difficulty breathing at bedtime and has become fussy during this period.

---

**History of Present Illness (HPI):** The child has had a persistent cough for approximately two days, which worsens at night and when he plays. He also reports a slight fever and a runny nose. No other symptoms are reported, such as difficulty swallowing or increased temperature beyond 38Â°C.

**Assessment / Diagnosis:** The primary diagnosis is likely due to viral respiratory infection, possibly exacerbated by the child's pre-existing asthma. No life-threatening signs were identified, indicating an emergent but stable condition requiring stabilization rather than immediate resuscitation.

**Plan / Treatment:** 
- **Medications:** Over-the-counter antihistamines (e.g., loratadine) to address potential allergies.
- **Procedures/Recommendations:** Suggest a nebulizer session if the cough is severe, aimed at reducing inflammation and improving breathing.
