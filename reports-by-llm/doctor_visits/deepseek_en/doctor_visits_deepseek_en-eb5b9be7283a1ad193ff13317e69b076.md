### **History of Present Illness (HPI)**
The patient reported a sudden onset of pain in his right ankle, which he described as tender and limping. He stated that the injury occurred when he stepped onto a step stool to retrieve something from a shelf after falling during playtime with his grandchildren. The pain was localized to the ankle and did not radiate to other parts of the body. No loss of consciousness or shortness of breath was reported.

### **Physical Examination Findings**
Upon examination, the patient exhibited mild tenderness at the base of the right ankle joint. There was a small nodule on the superior part of the ankle that appeared red and raised slightly above the surrounding skin. The ankle joint itself was normal in range of motion, with no instability or swelling beyond what could be attributed to the injury. No other notable findings were observed during the examination.

### **Assessment / Diagnosis**
Based on the patient's chief complaint, history of present illness, and physical examination findings, the primary diagnosis considered was a right ankle sprain. The injury appeared to result from a fall and subsequent stress to the joint.

### **Plan / Treatment**
The treatment plan includes the following:
1. **Rest:** The patient is advised to avoid activities that may exacerbate the injury.
2. **Ice Therapy:** Applying ice to the affected area for 15-20 minutes every 30 minutes to reduce swelling and pain.
3. **Over-the-counter Pain Relief:** Prescribing ibuprofen to alleviate pain and inflammation.
4. **Activity Modification:** Encouraging gradual return to light activity once the injury has healed.

No major procedures are necessary at this time, as the injury is considered less urgent and does not require hospitalization.

### **Follow-up Instructions**
The patient is instructed to return for follow-up in 7-10 days. If any exacerbation of symptoms occurs or if there is significant swelling or pain, the patient should return to the clinic immediately. The patient should bring any relevant medical records or documentation for review during the follow-up.
