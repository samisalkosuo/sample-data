She has tachycardia on auscultation due to increased effort to breathe.

Lung examination reveals crackles in the bases, bilaterally, consistent with productive cough and wheezing. There is minimal wheezing at baseline.

### **Assessment / Diagnosis**
Based on the patient’s chief complaint, history of illness, physical examination findings, and clinical impression, the primary diagnosis is an **acute COPD exacerbation**. The patient’s symptoms are consistent with a productive cough, crackles in the bases, and tachycardia due to increased effort to breathe.

Other possible causes were considered but ruled out based on:
- No evidence of fever or weight loss.
- No signs of acute infection (e.g., no wheezing at baseline).
- No signs of obstruction (e.g., no stridor or crackle in the apex).

The patient’s age and pre-existing condition (91 years old with stable COPD) make her cardiovascular system particularly delicate, but she is otherwise stable.

### **Plan / Treatment**
The treatment plan includes the following:
1. **Medical Therapy:**
   - Intravenous (IV) magnesium sulfate 20 mg to reduce pulmonary inflammation.
   - IV corticosteroids (e.g., dexamethasone 40 mg) to control symptoms and prevent further bronchial hyperreactivity.

2. **Expectant Treatment:**
   - Continued observation of the patient’s symptoms, as there is no evidence of an acute respiratory infection or obstruction.
   - Encouragement of rest and avoidance of activities that exacerbate her condition (e.g., prolonged exertion).

3. **Follow-Up:**
   - A follow-up appointment in two weeks to reassess her symptoms and ensure there has been no improvement or worsening.

4. **Recommendations:**
   - Patient is advised to continue using prescribed inhalers as directed.
   - Patient should monitor her symptoms closely and inform the healthcare provider if any signs of improvement or worsening occur.

### **Follow-Up Instructions**
- The patient will be seen in two weeks for follow-up evaluation.
- During the follow-up, the patient should report:
  - Any improvement or worsening of her symptoms.
  - Any occurrence of coughing at baseline (indicative of a bacterial infection).
  - Any signs of increased shortness of breath.

The healthcare provider will reassess her condition and adjust treatment as necessary. If the patient experiences persistent worsening of symptoms, she should return to the clinic immediately for further evaluation.
