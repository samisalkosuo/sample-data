### **Physical Examination Findings**
- **Vital Signs:** Blood pressure was normal, heart rate 88 bpm (sinus rhythm), and respiratory rate 16.
- **Chest Exam:** No signs of increased heart rate or tachycardia. The left sternal area was tender but not erythematous. No edema or wheezing was noted.
- **Lungs:** Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezing or crackles.
- **PEF:** No signs of shock, hypotension, or tachycardia.

### **Assessment / Diagnosis**
The patient presented with chest pain likely due to non-ST elevation angina (NST-EA). The findings suggest unstable angina with possible wall pain that may resolve on stress testing. Echocardiogram results showed normal left ventricular function without signs of myocardial infarction.

### **Plan / Treatment**
- **Medications:** Initiate intravenous nitroglycerine 10 mg/min to relieve chest pain.
- **Monitoring:** Start 24-hour ECG monitoring with a windowed stress test at rest (30 minutes post-admission).
- **Blood Work:** Order lipid panel and fasting glucose to rule out coronary artery disease or diabetes.

### **Follow-up Instructions**
Return for follow-up in 24 hours if chest pain persists. If symptoms worsen, experience nausea/dizziness, or report signs of shortness of breath or fainting, contact the clinic immediately.
