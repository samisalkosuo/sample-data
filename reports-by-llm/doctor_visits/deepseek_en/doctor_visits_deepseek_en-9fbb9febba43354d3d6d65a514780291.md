### **Chief Complaint**
The patient is a 39-year-old female who presented with severe, crushing substernal pain that began approximately one hour ago. The pain is described as sharp and worsening when she bends forward or lifts her arm. She also reported a significant drop in blood pressure from 120/80 mmHg to 90/60 mmHg.

### **History of Present Illness (HPI)**
The patient has been experiencing chest pain for about an hour, which is described as sharp and progressively worsening. She noticed the pain when she bent forward or lifted her arm. Her vital signs upon arrival showed a drop in blood pressure from 120/80 mmHg to 90/60 mmHg, indicating a significant hypotension. No other symptoms were reported at this time.

### **Physical Examination Findings**
Upon examination, the patient was found to have no edema in her extremities and no signs of shock. Her blood pressure was already low upon arrival, but there was no acute distress or cyanosis. The ECG revealed a ST-segment elevation with a probable Q wave pattern, suggesting possible STEMI (ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction). No other notable findings were observed during the physical examination.

### **Assessment / Diagnosis**
Based on the patient's presentation and physical examination findings, the primary diagnosis is **ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI)**. Given her age of 39, this condition may have a different risk profile compared to older adults with similar presentations. The low blood pressure observed should be monitored closely.

### **Plan / Treatment**
1. **Immediate Medical Attention:** Address the chest pain and ensure adequate control of blood pressure.
2. **Medical Interventions:**
   - Administer immediate analgesics for chest pain (e.g., nitroglycerin).
   - Monitor blood pressure with a non-invasive monitor to assess trends.
3. **Diagnostic Testing:** Schedule an echo or stress test in the next 24-48 hours to further evaluate the STEMI.

### **Follow-up Instructions**
The patient should return to the clinic in 24-48 hours for follow-up. If she experiences any improvement but still reports chest pain, she should return immediately. If there are no signs of improvement, she should seek emergency care without delay.
