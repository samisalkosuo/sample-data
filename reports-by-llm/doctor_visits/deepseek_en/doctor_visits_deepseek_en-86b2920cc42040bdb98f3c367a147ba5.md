### **History of Present Illness (HPI)**

No other symptoms were mentioned during the visit, including fever, weight loss, or difficulty breathing.

### **Assessment / Diagnosis**
Based on the patient’s presentation and examination findings, the primary diagnosis is a mild allergic reaction or skin irritation likely related to an environmental exposure (e.g., pollen or pet dander). No systemic symptoms were present, and no evidence of anaphylaxis was observed.

---

### **Plan / Treatment**
The patient will be treated with oral antihistamine medication (e.g., Claritin or Lantibiotic) to reduce the itching and discomfort caused by the rash. No further diagnostic testing is necessary at this time. The child should avoid exposure to potential allergens until the rash resolves.

---

### **Follow-up Instructions**
The patient will be followed up in two weeks for reassessment of the rash. If no resolution occurs, or if any worsening symptoms are noted, she should return to the clinic promptly. Additionally, she should continue to monitor her environment and avoid exposure to potential allergens such as pollen or pet dander.
