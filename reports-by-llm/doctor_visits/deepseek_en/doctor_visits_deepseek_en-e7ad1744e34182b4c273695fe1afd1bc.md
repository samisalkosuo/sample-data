### **Chief Complaint**
The patient is a 59-year-old female who presented with severe, persistent chest pain radiating to her back for approximately 15 minutes. She described the pain as progressively worsening and stated that it started about 30 minutes prior to arrival.

---

### **History of Present Illness (HPI)**
The patient reported significant, unrelieved pain in the right upper chest area, which had been radiating to her back. She described the pain as sharp and intermittent but now progressively worsening. She stated that it started approximately 30 minutes prior to arrival and became significantly worse upon exertion or breathing difficulties. The patient reported that she could not walk properly due to the pain and that it was causing significant distress.

The patient denied any recent trauma, fever, or other systemic symptoms. She mentioned that she had been feeling generally well in the past 24 hours but noted that her blood pressure had recently increased to about 140/90 mmHg during the episode. She reported no history of diabetes, hypertension, or heart disease.

### **Physical Examination Findings**
Upon arrival, the patient was conscious and alert but appeared significantly distressed due to the pain. She denied any shortness of breath or other signs of respiratory distress. 

- **Vital Signs:** Blood pressure: 140/90 mmHg; Heart rate: 120 bpm.
- **Chest Examination:** Auscultatory findings revealed a crescendo rub on the right inferiobicipal territory, suggestive of possible ST-segment elevation (ST elevation myocardial infarction [STEMI]).
- **Lung Examination:** No wheezing or crackles were noted.

No other significant findings were observed during the physical examination.

---

### **Assessment / Diagnosis**
Based on the patient’s presentation and physical examination findings, the primary diagnosis is **acute chest pain due to STEMI (ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction)**. The patient is considered a high-risk individual for further complications given her age and the presence of significant coronary artery disease.

Additional diagnostic workup includes:
- Echocardiogram to assess left ventricular function.
- STFT (stress test) to confirm STEMI and rule out percutaneous PCI candidates.

---

### **Plan / Treatment**
The immediate plan involves:
1. **Emergency Medical Treatment (EMT):** Administer 500 mg nitroglycerin IV within the first 3 minutes of arrival to reduce vasoconstriction at the site of pain.
2. **Transport:** Ambulance transport to the nearest emergency department for further evaluation and treatment.
3. **Imaging:** Order an echocardiogram to guide catheter ablation or PCI.

Medical intervention includes:
- Intravenous fluids, electrolytes, and blood products as needed.
- Anticoagulation therapy (e.g., heparin 1000U/h) to prevent thrombus formation in the coronary artery.
- Close monitoring of vital signs during transport and initial stabilization.

---

### **Follow-up Instructions**
The patient is expected to contact the emergency department within 24 hours for further evaluation. If symptoms persist or worsen, she should return to the emergency department immediately. The patient’s primary care physician will be notified if this episode recurs.
