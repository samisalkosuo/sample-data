### **Chief Complaint**

---

### **History of Present Illness (HPI)**
The patient reports a chronic cough that began approximately two weeks ago. She experiences difficulty breathing at night, which occasionally wakes her up. She mentions that the cough is more pronounced when exposed to cold air and notes occasional wheezing, though it does not appear severe.

### **Physical Examination Findings**
- **Vital Signs:** Blood pressure: 120/80 mmHg; Heart rate: 75 bpm; Temperature: 36.9Â°C.
- **Upper Respiratory Area:** Bilateral wheezing on auscultation, but no evidence of wheezing crackles or productive secretions.
- **Lung Sounds:** Clear and unremarkable bilaterally.
- **No signs of cardiovascular distress or fluid overload.**

### **Assessment/Diagnosis**
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, the primary diagnosis is likely an exacerbation of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The persistent cough and dyspnea are consistent with these conditions, which are common in elderly patients.

---

### **Plan / Treatment**
- **Medications:** Prescribe a short-acting bronchodilator inhaler (e.g., Fluticasone) with an expectorant to manage asthma or COPD exacerbations.
- **Preventive Measures:** Advise the patient to avoid irritants such as smoke and strong odors. Encourage continued physical activity but caution against overexertion.
- **Home Care Routine:** Recommend using a humidifier if airways appear dry.

### **Follow-up Instructions**
The patient should return for follow-up in two weeks to assess symptom improvement and adjust treatment as needed. A follow-up visit at six weeks is scheduled to evaluate the effectiveness of the current management plan.
