The patient reported that she has applied some ointment previously but it did not fully resolve the issue.

### **History of Present Illness (HPI)**
The patient described the rash as tender to the touch, with a raised elevation in temperature at the affected area. She noted that the rash began about two weeks ago and has progressively worsened slightly today. The patient mentioned that she has applied an over-the-counter antifungal cream in the past but it did not fully alleviate the symptoms. No other symptoms were reported, such as fever, weight loss, or fatigue.

### **Physical Examination Findings**
The physical examination revealed no acute signs of illness. The patient's vital signs were within normal limits (BP: 128/76 mmHg, HR: 78 bpm, RR: 18 breaths/min, T: 36.5Â°C). The skin examination showed a small, red, slightly elevated rash on the left arm, with no other notable findings.

### **Assessment / Diagnosis**
Based on the patient's history and physical examination, the primary diagnosis is considered to be **dermatological in nature**, specifically a localized cutaneous reaction. Given the age of the patient (102 years) and her medical history, which includes hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and cardiovascular disease, it was noted that any underlying condition should be monitored.

### **Plan / Treatment**
The treatment plan involves the following:
- **Medications:** No specific medications are prescribed at this time. The patient is advised to continue using the ointment she applied previously.
- **Procedures:** A localized dermabrasion was performed to remove the rash, and a small sample of the exudate was sent for culture and susceptibility testing (CST) to determine if it is fungal or allergic in origin.
- **Recommendations:** The patient will be monitored at her next follow-up visit. She should avoid irritants such as alcohol, spicy foods, and harsh soaps.

### **Follow-up Instructions**
The patient will return for a follow-up appointment in two weeks to assess the improvement of the rash. During this time, she is encouraged to monitor any changes or worsening of the condition. If the rash persists or worsens beyond the expected timeline, she should return to the clinic for further evaluation.
