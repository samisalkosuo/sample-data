### **History of Present Illness (HPI)**

### **Assessment / Diagnosis**  
Based on the patient's chief complaint, history of illness, and physical examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is a mild allergic reaction or dermal hypersensitivity to an allergen encountered recently. The rash is consistent with contact dermatitis, which typically occurs due to exposure to irritants, allergens, or chemicals.

### **Plan / Treatment**  
The plan of care includes:  
1. Topical application of an antihistamine cream (e.g., cetirizine) to reduce itching and erythema at the affected site.  
2. Observation for any worsening symptoms over the next 48 hours.  

No further hospitalization or specialized treatments are required due to the mild nature of the complaint.

### **Follow-up Instructions**  
The patient is advised to monitor the rash for any signs of improvement or worsening. A follow-up consultation is scheduled for 14 days from today (16.01.2025) if there are no significant changes in the condition.
