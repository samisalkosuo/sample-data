   The patient is advised to avoid activities that may exacerbate her condition, such as running or jumping, and to limit activity to light duty (e.g., sitting, gentle walking) until cleared by the healthcare provider.

3. ** splinting:**  
   A supportive splint or brace will be applied to the left ankle to immobilize it and prevent further displacement during rest periods.
