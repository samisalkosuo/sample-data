### **History of Present Illness (HPI)**
The patient reported a localized, mild rash on her left arm that appeared approximately 48 hours prior to the visit. She described it as itchy and red but did not experience any intense itching or burning. The rash was localized to the area where she had applied garden pesticides recently. No other symptoms were reported at this time.

### **Physical Examination Findings**
Upon examination, the patient appeared healthy with no signs of distress. Her vital signs were within normal limits.

### **Assessment / Diagnosis**
Based on the patientâ€™s presentation, the diagnosis is most likely an allergic reaction to poison ivy or another allergen. The rash is consistent with a mild allergic dermatitis and does not indicate any acute medical emergency.

---

### **Plan / Treatment**
The plan of care includes:
- Prescribing a topical antihistamine cream (e.g., loratadine) to treat the rash.
- Monitoring for any worsening symptoms over the next 24 hours. If the rash persists or spreads, further evaluation may be warranted.
- No hospitalization is anticipated as this is considered a minor, self-limiting condition.

### **Follow-up Instructions**
The patient should avoid direct contact with poison ivy to prevent potential allergic reactions. She is advised to monitor her symptoms for any signs of worsening and to return to the clinic in 2 days if the rash continues to be bothersome or if she experiences any systemic symptoms such as fever, swelling, or respiratory distress.

If the rash does not improve or worsen within this timeframe, the patient should contact her primary care provider for further evaluation.
