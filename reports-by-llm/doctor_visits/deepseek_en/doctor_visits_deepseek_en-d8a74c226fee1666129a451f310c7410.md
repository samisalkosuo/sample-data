### **Chief Complaint**
The patient is a 99-year-old female who presented with sudden collapse, accompanied by chest pain that increased in severity and shortness of breath. She reported feeling faint and unable to continue conversation, which led her to seek immediate medical attention.

---

### **History of Present Illness (HPI)**
The patient experienced sudden onset of symptoms approximately 30 minutes prior to arrival. The chief complaint was a severe chest pain that radiated to her jawline and neck, worsening rapidly. She described difficulty breathing and reported palpitations upon awakening from the episode. She mentioned feeling faint and unable to speak after collapsing.

### **Physical Examination Findings**
Upon arrival, the patient appeared unresponsive with a normal heart rate of 120 bpm but an elevated blood pressure of 98/60 mmHg. She exhibited signs of shock, including cool extremities (especially the face), tachycardia, and a rapid breathing rate. No visible injuries were noted.

---

### **Assessment / Diagnosis**
The patient's presentation was consistent with an acute medical emergency, most likely related to sudden cardiac arrest or anaphylaxis. Given her advanced age, underlying cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., hypertension) contributed to the episode. Further diagnostic workup is required to confirm the cause and ensure appropriate management.

### **Plan / Treatment**
Immediate intervention was prioritized:
1. **Advanced Airway Management:** CPR and application of the Heimlich maneuver were performed.
2. **Resuscitation:** Administering 0.5 mcg epinephrine subcutaneously to stabilize vital signs, as anaphylaxis is a plausible diagnosis given her age and symptoms.
3. **Vital Signs Stabilization:** Blood pressure was maintained at 100/65 mmHg with intravenous fluids and nitroprusside for potential cardiac arrest.
4. **Defibrillation:** A defibrillator was used to prevent further cardiac episodes.

---

### **Follow-up Instructions**
The patient will be monitored at home with the following medications: Losartan 12.5 mg orally twice daily to manage any underlying cardiovascular risk factors. She should avoid alcohol and smoke, and report any worsening symptoms or inability to respond to treatment within 48 hours. Follow-up appointments are scheduled for tomorrow and in two weeks.

This structured approach ensures that the patient receives immediate and appropriate medical attention while outlining clear follow-up instructions for her care.
