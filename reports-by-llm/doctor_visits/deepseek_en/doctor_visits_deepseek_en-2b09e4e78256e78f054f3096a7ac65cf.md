### **Assessment / Diagnosis**  
Based on the patient’s chief complaint, HPI, and physical examination findings, the primary diagnosis is **coronary artery disease (CAD)**. The ECG revealed ST elevation in leads II and aVF, suggesting possible STEMI (ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction). The patient has a significant family history of cardiovascular disease, which further supports this diagnosis.

No acute instability was identified during the examination, ruling out emergency-level conditions such as cardiac arrest or respiratory failure. Therefore, this case falls under severity level 4: **Less-Urgent – stable, 1 resource**.

### **Plan / Treatment**  
- **Initial Management:**  
  - Prescribe ibuprofen (e.g., 600 mg orally) to relieve chest pain and reduce inflammation.  
  - Monitor vital signs closely during exertion or stress.  
  - Advise the patient to avoid further exertion until advised otherwise.

- **Next Steps:**  
  - If symptoms worsen, the patient will be referred for further evaluation, including an ECHOCARDIOGRAM (echo) to assess the extent of CAD and determine if further intervention is necessary.

---

### **Follow-up Instructions**  
The patient should return for follow-up in approximately two weeks. During this time, she should monitor her symptoms and report any changes or worsening. If she experiences significant improvement but still has chest pain, she should return immediately to discuss further management. Additionally, the patient will be scheduled for a follow-up appointment with her general practitioner to review her medical history and treatment plan.
