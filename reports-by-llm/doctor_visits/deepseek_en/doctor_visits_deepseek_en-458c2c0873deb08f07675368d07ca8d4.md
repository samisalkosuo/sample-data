**Visit Summary**

**Visit Date:** 02.02.2025  
**Clinic or Hospital Location:** Ähtäri  

---

### **Chief Complaint**
The patient, a 62-year-old male, presented with a mild rash on his arms and legs during travel last week.

---

### **History of Present Illness (HPI)**
The rash began approximately two days prior to arrival in Ähtäri. It appeared after the patient experienced an allergic reaction while receiving injections at a local clinic. The rash is localized, confined to the anterior arms and posterior legs, with no systemic symptoms such as fever or fatigue.

---

### **Physical Examination Findings**
Upon examination, the patient reported localized swelling at the affected extremities. No systemic findings were noted, including no fever, weight loss, or other signs of systemic disease. The rash was tender but not painful, with no associated redness or pruney skin changes.

---

### **Assessment / Diagnosis**
The primary diagnosis is likely contact dermatitis due to friction during travel. No evidence suggests an allergic reaction beyond the current visit; therefore, further evaluation for other causes (e.g., irritants) was deemed unnecessary at this time.

---

### **Plan / Treatment**
- **Topical Antihistamines:** prescribed to alleviate symptoms.
- **Monitoring:** close observation of the rash's progression over the next 24 hours.
- **No Further Action:** no need for hospitalization or additional tests.

### **Follow-up Instructions**
The patient should take a shower immediately after applying the topical medication. Follow-up will be scheduled in 24 to 48 hours if the rash does not improve or worsen.
