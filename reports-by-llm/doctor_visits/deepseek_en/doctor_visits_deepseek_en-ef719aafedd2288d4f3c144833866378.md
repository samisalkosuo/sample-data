### **Chief Complaint**
The patient is a 76-year-old female presenting with acute respiratory distress, which began abruptly about 30 minutes ago. She reports difficulty breathing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, which has progressively worsened. She also experiences chest pain and feels fatigued.

---

### **History of Present Illness (HPI)**
The patient is a retired female with a history of hypertension and diabetes. She denies recent changes in lifestyle or medications. On presentation, she appears normocytic and pale due to suspected respiratory distress. She reports no prior medical emergency but has experienced chronic coughing over the past decade.

Symptoms began abruptly about 30 minutes ago, starting with mild dyspnea that quickly escalated to exertional dyspnea on exertion. She describes a dry cough with crackles in the lung bases and wheezing bilaterally. She also reports chest pain localized to the left side, which is relieved upon deep breathing.

### **Physical Examination Findings**
- **Vitals:** tachycardia (120 bpm), blood pressure 140/90 mmHg, slightly elevated jugular venous distension.
- **Respiratory Exam:** crackles in the lung bases bilaterally, wheezing, and decreased breath sounds on auscultation. She reports cyanosis (10% oxygen saturation on room air).
- **Labs:** normocytic anemia with reticulocytes increased (+35%), leukopenia (-20%), and elevated white blood cell count (+40%). Blood glucose is normal, and she denies diabetes symptoms.
- **Other:** Mild hoarseness of voice.

### **Assessment/Diagnosis**
The patient presents with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to unknown etiology. Given her age, hypertension, and diabetes, the most likely causes are an infectious process (e.g., pneumonia or COVID-19), an allergic reaction, or a heart-related emergency (e.g., sudden cardiac arrest).

---

### **Plan / Treatment**
Immediate interventions include:
- **Oxygen therapy:** 8 L/mÂ²/h via nasal cannula.
- **Blood work:** To assess for infection, anemia, or other complications.
- **Antihistamines:** If symptoms suggest an allergic reaction (e.g., antihistamine 50 mg orally every 4 hours).
- **Echocardiogram:** To rule out sudden heart disease.

---

### **Follow-up Instructions**
The patient should return for follow-up in two weeks with her primary care physician. Blood work results will guide further management. If symptoms persist or improve, she should return to the emergency department.
