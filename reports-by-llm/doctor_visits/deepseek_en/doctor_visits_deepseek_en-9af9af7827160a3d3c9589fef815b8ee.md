### **History of Present Illness (HPI)**

### **Physical Examination Findings**  
Upon examination, the patient appeared alert and oriented, with no history of fever, nausea, or vomiting. Her vital signs were within normal limits (BP 120/80 mmHg, HR 78 bpm).

### **Assessment / Diagnosis**  
Based on the patient’s chief complaint and physical examination findings, the primary diagnosis considered is a likely herniated disc (C7) involving the sciatic nerve root. No evidence of acute neurological deficits, muscle weakness, or radicular symptoms was identified at this time.

### **Plan / Treatment**  
The treatment plan includes:  
1. **Imaging:** A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine to confirm the diagnosis and assess soft tissue involvement.  
2. **Physical Therapy:** Gentle stretching and strengthening exercises to improve flexibility and reduce muscle tension in the lower back area.  
3. **Pain Management:** Prescribed a short course of acetaminophen for pain relief, to be taken as needed with water.

### **Follow-up Instructions**  
The patient is advised to return for follow-up in 2 weeks for imaging results and to reassess her symptoms. If the MRI indicates significant soft tissue involvement or if pain persists, further treatment may be considered.
