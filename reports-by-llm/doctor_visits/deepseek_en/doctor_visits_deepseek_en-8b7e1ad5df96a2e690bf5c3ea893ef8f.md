**Clinic Location:** Mäntyharju

### **Chief Complaint**
The patient is a 66-year-old female who presented with severe difficulty breathing and sudden chest pain. She began experiencing these symptoms approximately two days prior, initially feeling unwell with fatigue and weight loss.

---

### **History of Present Illness (HPI)**
The patient reported significant shortness of breath, which worsened rapidly during the visit. She described a sharp, exertion-induced chest pain radiating to her back, onset of which was sudden. She also mentioned experiencing fatigue and weight loss in the preceding days.

---

### **Physical Examination Findings**
- **Vital Signs:** Tachycardia (120 bpm), irregular breathing, elevated blood pressure (~140/85 mmHg), and a high temperature (38°C).
- **Respiratory Exam:** Room air hypoxia (95% on room air), crackles in the lung bases.
- **Chest Exam:** Mild crackling at bilateral bases; no wheezing or stridor noted.

---

### **Assessment/Diagnosis**
The patient's symptoms, including tachycardia and respiratory distress, suggest acute compromise of systemic circulation. Possible diagnoses include:
1. **Acute Heart Failure:** Elevated blood pressure and heart rate consistent with a myocardial infarction.
2. **Acute Asthma:** Chest pain radiating to the back is uncommon but possible in severe asthma.
3. **Allergic Reaction:** Sudden chest pain could indicate anaphylaxis, though this is less likely given her age.

### **Plan / Treatment**
- **Immediate Measures:**
  - Administer oxygen via nasal cannula at 4 L/min to improve respiratory support.
  - Initiate IV fluids (500 mL of Ringer's lactated solution) for hydration and nutrition.
  - Perform an ECG to monitor cardiac activity. If signs of arrhythmia are detected, consider placement of a defibrillator.

- **Short-Term:** Monitor vital signs closely; if no improvement within 30 minutes, discontinue spontaneous breathing and establish mechanical ventilation or ECMO as needed.

### **Follow-up Instructions**
1. **Home Administration:** Patient will take inhalers for asthma (if applicable) and corticosteroids for any suspected allergic reaction.
2. **Follow-Up Appointment:** Schedule a follow-up in 24-48 hours to reassess symptoms and treatment response.
3. **Vital Signs Monitoring:** Close monitoring of blood pressure, heart rate, and temperature.
