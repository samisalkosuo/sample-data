**Visit Summary**

**Visit Date:** 31.03.2024  
**Clinic or Hospital Location:** Kustavi  

---

### **Chief Complaint**
The patient, a 53-year-old male, presented with persistent chest pain for approximately 10 minutes, which began two hours prior to the visit. The pain was described as sharp and worsened when the patient bent forward or lifted his arm.

---

### **History of Present Illness (HPI)**
The patient has reported a history of chest pain over the past decade, typically lasting several minutes with no significant worsening unless he consumed alcohol. He denied recent trauma, fever, or weight loss. On this occasion, he underwent a routine heartworm test last week and tested positive.

---

### **Physical Examination Findings**
Upon arrival, the patient appeared distressed but did not exhibit signs of acute distress without delay. His vital signs were within normal limits except for slightly elevated heart rate (98 bpm) and blood pressure (125/78 mmHg). He reported palpitations, which he attributed to anxiety from the pain.

No significant findings were noted during the physical examination.

### **Assessment / Diagnosis**
The patient's presentation aligns with an acute episode of chest pain. Given his age, history of chest pain, and positive heartworm test, possible causes include acute coronary syndrome (ACS), angina pectoris, or a potential risk factor for sudden cardiac arrest. No evidence of pulmonary embolism was identified.

### **Plan / Treatment**
The patient will be admitted for further evaluation. The following tests and treatments are planned:
- Echocardiogram to assess left ventricular function.
- Blood tests to evaluate for cardiac markers (e.g., troponin, CK-MB).
- Antianxiety medication to alleviate anxiety symptoms.
- Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) for pain management.

---

### **Follow-up Instructions**
The patient should avoid NSAIDs until cleared by his attending physician. He is advised to return for follow-up in 24 hours if chest pain persists or worsens, or within 48 hours if signs of improvement are noted but symptoms remain unchanged.
