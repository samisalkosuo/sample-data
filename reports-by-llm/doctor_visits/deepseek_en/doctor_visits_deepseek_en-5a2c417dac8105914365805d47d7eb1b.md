### **History of Present Illness (HPI)**
The patient, a 43-year-old male with no significant past medical history, has been experiencing a gradual onset of symptoms over the past few days. He has reported feeling unwell but has not sought immediate attention. The pain began suddenly and is now rated on a scale of 1 to 5 (on a scale from 1 to 10) as moderate.

- **Shortness of breath** for about five minutes.

### **Physical Examination Findings**
The physical examination revealed the following:
- **Dry mouth and dry eyes** due to possible dehydration.
- **Edema in the legs and feet**, suggesting fluid retention from vomiting.
- **Elevated blood pressure**, consistent with acute decompensatory hypovolemia.
- No palpable tenderness or signs of infection.

### **Assessment / Diagnosis**
The provider assessed the patient for acute chest pain, ruling out immediate life-threatening conditions such as cardiac arrest. The primary diagnosis considered is **angina pectoris** due to the location and nature of the pain. However, given the patient's history of vomiting and fluid retention, the provider also considers the possibility of an undiagnosed gastrointestinal issue or a urinary tract infection.

### **Plan / Treatment**
The immediate plan involves:
- Providing reassurance and reassessment.
- Ordering blood work to evaluate for possible complications (e.g., bacterial infection).
- Administering intravenous fluids to address dehydration and restore fluid balance.
- Monitoring vital signs closely, including blood pressure and heart rate.

If symptoms persist or worsen, further treatment may include additional diagnostic tests or medication as directed by the provider.

### **Follow-up Instructions**
The patient is instructed to return for follow-up in 2-3 days. If no significant changes are observed, further testing will be scheduled at that time.
