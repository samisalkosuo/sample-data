### **Chief Complaint**
The patient is a 58-year-old female who presented with a mild rash on her right arm. The rash began approximately two days prior and has been progressively worse over the past 4 hours. She described it as a slight redness that she believes may have been caused by her recent exposure to laundry detergent.

### **History of Present Illness (HPI)**
The patient reported experiencing itching on her right arm about two days ago, which worsened slightly yesterday evening and has now become significantly red within the past four hours. She noted that the rash appeared after she washed her hands with a soap containing fragrance from the detergent. No other symptoms were reported at this time.

### **Physical Examination Findings**
Upon examination, the patient was alert and oriented, with no significant systemic signs of distress (e.g., tachycardia, hypotension). The right arm exhibited a mild, red rash that covered approximately 20% of the skin surface. No other notable findings were observed during the physical examination.

### **Assessment / Diagnosis**
Based on the patient’s presentation and clinical history, the primary diagnosis is considered to be a mild allergic reaction or contact dermatitis. The rash is localized to the right arm and does not appear to involve systemic areas of the body. No evidence of systemic symptoms (e.g., fever, weight loss) was noted.

### **Plan / Treatment**
The patient will be treated with over-the-counter antihistamine medication to alleviate the itching caused by the mild allergic reaction. Specifically, she is advised to use topical antihistamines such asloratadine or cetirizine for localized relief. No further diagnostic testing or specialized treatments are required at this time.

### **Follow-up Instructions**
The patient should monitor her condition over the next 24-48 hours and report any worsening symptoms. If the rash persists after 7 days, she should return to the clinic for further evaluation. Additionally, she is instructed to avoid further exposure to potentially irritating substances (e.g., laundry detergents) until cleared by the healthcare provider.
