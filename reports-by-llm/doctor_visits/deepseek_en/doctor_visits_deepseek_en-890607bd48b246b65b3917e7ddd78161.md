  - Refer to a cardiologist for further evaluation, including an EPTA (electrophilic lipid test) and possible angiography.
  - Start ACE inhibitor therapy (e.g., Losartan 40 mg twice daily) to improve cardiac function.
- **Lifestyle Modifications:** Encourage a low-sodium diet, regular exercise, and stress management.
