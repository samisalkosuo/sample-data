---

### **History of Present Illness (HPI)**
The patient has been asymptomatic for the past several hours but developed sudden onset of chest pain that started approximately 10 minutes ago. He described it as a squeezing sensation in his left chest, which worsened rapidly and became progressively more intense. He reported difficulty breathing, particularly when exerting himself, and was unable to speak coherently before losing consciousness.

The patient has a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). He is a smoker with a 30-year smoking history. He denies recent trauma or infection but reports occasional episodes of dizziness in the past.

### **Physical Examination Findings**
Upon arrival, the patient was unresponsive and appeared in shock. Blood pressure was elevated at 160/95 mmHg, heart rate was rapid (120 bpm), and respiratory rate was increased to 30 breaths per minute. SpO2 levels were critically low at 88% on room air.

The physical examination revealed tachycardia, a distended abdomen, and no other notable findings.

### **Assessment / Diagnosis**
Based on the patient's presentation, vital signs, and clinical history, the primary diagnosis is **sudden cardiac arrest (SCA)**. Other possible conditions considered include anaphylaxis or acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, but these are secondary to the primary emergency of SCA.

### **Plan / Treatment**
1. **CPR without paddling:** Immediate application of CPR by trained staff until defibrillation can be administered.
2. **Medical Oxygen:** Intubation and delivery of oxygen at 10 L/min via a non-reversible mask.
3. **Anticoagulation Therapy:** Initiation of low-dose aspirin or warfarin to prevent thromboembolic events, pending further imaging.
4. **Defibrillator Implantation:** If successful CPR is performed and defibrillation is delivered, the patient will receive a implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) for ongoing management.

---

### **Follow-up Instructions**
1. **Emergency Medical Services (EMS):** Call 000 or visit the emergency department immediately if cardiac arrest was caused by medical emergency.
2. **Monitoring:** The patient should remain in the examination room until stabilized, with close monitoring of vital signs and oxygen saturation.
3. **Home Monitoring:** If no medical emergency is identified, monitor the patient at home for 48 hours for worsening symptoms or signs of respiratory distress.
