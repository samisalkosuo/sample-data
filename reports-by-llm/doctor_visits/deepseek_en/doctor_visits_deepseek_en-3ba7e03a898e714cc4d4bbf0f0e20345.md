---

### **History of Present Illness (HPI)**
The patient has a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and chronic respiratory conditions, all of which are exacerbated by age-related changes in her body. On this occasion, she was exposed to an unknown allergen, likely pollen or dust, leading to the onset of symptoms.

Symptoms began with a mild rash on her arms at 10:30 AM, which progressively spread to her face and neck by 12:00 PM. She reported feeling itchy and red but described the discoloration around her mouth as concerning. She denied fever or other systemic symptoms but noted difficulty breathing upon exertion.

### **Physical Examination Findings**
- Rapid pulse (120 bpm), indicating possible shock.
- Shallow, labored breathing (20 breaths per minute).
- Discoloration of the mouth and tongue due to low oxygen levels.
- Normal vital signs otherwise, with no palpable edema or tachycardia.

### **Assessment / Diagnosis**
Based on the patient's presentation, history, and physical examination findings, the primary diagnosis is **anaphylaxis**, a severe allergic reaction. The rapid pulse and discoloration around the mouth are key indicators of tissue hypoxia due to low oxygen levels from anaphylactic shock.

---

### **Plan / Treatment**
- Immediate intravenous administration of epinephrine (0.3 mg) to manage the anaphylaxis.
- IV fluids to replenish electrolytes and blood volume.
- Considered for intravenous antihistamines or corticosteroids if epinephrine is ineffective.
- Patient will be admitted for observation and monitored closely.

### **Follow-up Instructions**
- Referral to an allergist for further evaluation of the allergen exposure.
- Follow-up with primary care physician in 24 hours to assess for any long-term effects or allergic sensitivities.
- Close monitoring of the patient's condition, with potential repeat hospitalization if complications arise.
