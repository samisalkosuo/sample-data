### **Chief Complaint**  
The patient presented with severe chest pain, described as intermittent in nature, occurring primarily during physical activity and exertion. The pain is described as sharp and localized to the left side of the chest, radiating to the arm. The patient also reported nausea and shortness of breath, which worsens with increased activity.

### **History of Present Illness (HPI)**  
The patient is a 20-year-old male who has no significant past medical history. On presentation, the patient indicated that he had been engaging in moderate physical activity when the pain began. The pain started approximately 15 minutes prior to the visit and initially lasted for about 3-5 minutes before subsiding. However, it returned after a brief respite of 2 minutes. The patient reported no history of chest pain or heart disease. He denied any recent trauma or falls. The pain is described as worse with exertion and is associated with a palpitations sensation.

### **Physical Examination Findings**  
Upon arrival, the patient was oriented and alert but appeared slightly disoriented. His vital signs were:  
- Blood pressure: 140/90 mmHg (elevated)  
- Heart rate: 120 bpm (tachycardic)  
- Temperature: 36.8°C (slightly elevated due to hypothermia from shivering)  

The patient reported a visible laceration on the left arm, approximately 2 cm in length, which was consistent with trauma or fall-related injury. The wound was clean but not bleeding actively. There were no palpable scars or other injuries noted.

On physical examination, there was no evidence of acute respiratory distress or other systemic symptoms. The patient’s extremities were warm to the touch, and he denied any use of alcohol or drugs in the past 24 hours.

### **Assessment/Diagnosis**  
Based on the clinical presentation, the primary diagnosis is an acute chest injury due to a fall or external trauma. Given the age and severity level (Level 2: Emergent – potential life threat), further stabilization is required. The patient’s symptoms are consistent with possible acute myocardial infarction (STEMI) if there is evidence of prior heart disease, but this is not confirmed at this time.

### **Plan / Treatment**  
The immediate plan involves stabilizing the patient and ensuring their safety while awaiting further evaluation. The following measures will be taken:  
1. **Immediate intervention:**  
   - Administer pain relief (e.g., ibuprofen or acetaminophen) as needed to alleviate discomfort.  
   - Provide analgesics for any suspected heart-related pain, such as nitroglycerin if indicated by the patient’s symptoms.  

2. **Stabilization measures:**  
   - Ensure the patient is immobilized to prevent further injury and maintain airway patency.  
   - Administer intravenous fluids (e.g., 1000 mL of normal saline) to address potential hypovolemia or dehydration.  

3. **Emergency referral:**  
   - The patient will be referred to an emergency department for further evaluation, including imaging studies such as ECG and chest X-ray.  

---

### **Follow-up Instructions**  
- The patient should avoid driving due to the risk of dizziness or fainting.  
- He is advised to monitor his symptoms closely and report any worsening signs immediately.  
- The patient will be followed up in 24-48 hours for further evaluation and treatment as needed.
