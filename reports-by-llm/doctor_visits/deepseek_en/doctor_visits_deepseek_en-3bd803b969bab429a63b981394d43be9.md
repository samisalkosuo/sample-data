### **Physical Examination Findings**
- **Elevated Heart Rate:** 120 bpm (normal range: 60-100 bpm)
- **Blood Pressure:** 140/85 mmHg (normal range: <120/80 mmHg)
- **Edema:** Mild edema noted in the legs, consistent with vasoconstriction.
- **Thrill:** Present along the extremities, suggesting possible vasoconstriction or perivascular disease.
- **No signs of shock, palpitations, or cyanosis on auscultation.**

### **Assessment/Diagnosis**
Based on the patient's presentation and physical examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is acute inferior wall myocardial infarction (STEMI). The sudden onset of chest pain, elevated heart rate, and mild edema are consistent with this condition. However, since it falls under severity level 2, immediate life-threatening complications were not observed.

---

### **Plan / Treatment**
- **Immediate Treatment:** Intravenous nitroglycerin at 10 mcg/min to relieve chest pain.
- **Monitoring:** Continuous monitoring of blood pressure and ECG for signs of STEMI or other cardiac abnormalities.
- **Diagnostic Testing:** Schedule a stress test (e.g., thallium scintigraphy) if indicated by ECG findings.

### **Follow-up Instructions**
The patient should return in two weeks for follow-up evaluation, with special attention to any chest pain experienced during physical activity. If symptoms persist or worsen, the patient should return immediately for further assessment and treatment.

**Next Follow-up:** In two weeks, review of symptoms, ECG results, and any chest pain experienced during exercise will be conducted. A follow-up appointment is scheduled for 10 am the following day.
