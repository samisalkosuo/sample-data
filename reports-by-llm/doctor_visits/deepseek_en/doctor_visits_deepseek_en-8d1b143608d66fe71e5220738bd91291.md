### **Chief Complaint**
The patient is a 80-year-old male who presented with "chest pain for the past three months." The pain has been persistent and occurs at rest, without any radiation to the arm or jaw. There have been no recent trauma or acute events.

---

### **History of Present Illness (HPI)**
The patient reported a gradual onset of chest pain over the past 30 days, starting in early March. It is described as a dull pressure sensation that has worsened with exertion. The pain does not radiate to the arm or jaw and has been accompanied by no significant shortness of breath or other symptoms.

No recent trauma or acute episodes have occurred. The patient denies any history of chest pain in the past year, but reports occasional discomfort during physical activity. There is no history of fever, weight loss, or other systemic symptoms.

### **Physical Examination Findings**
The patient's vital signs were stable upon arrival: blood pressure 130/85 mmHg, pulse rate 78 bpm, and heart rate 62 bpm. No acute signs such as shortness of breath, edema, or tachycardia were observed.

Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally. The extremities showed no edema, consistent with fluid retention not related to diuretic use. The patient reported a slight discoloration in the right foot, likely due to peripheral edema from diabetes or heart failure.

The ECG revealed normal rhythm and rate (78 bpm), with no ST-T changes noted on leads 1 and 2 but showed ST deviation on lead V6. No murmurs were heard bilaterally.

### **Assessment / Diagnosis**
Based on the patient's presentation, history, and physical examination findings, the primary diagnosis is **stable angina pectoris** with possible underlying risk factors for cardiovascular disease (e.g., hypertension or diabetes). The chest pain is likely related to coronary artery disease but does not present as an acute emergency.

No acute threat to life was identified. However, the patient's age and potential comorbidities necessitate continued monitoring and management.

### **Plan / Treatment**
1. **Medications:**
   - Lisinopril 20 mg orally twice daily to control blood pressure (as a monotherapy or combination with Metformin).
   - Metformin 500 mg orally twice daily for type 2 diabetes, if indicated by HbA1c levels.

2. **Imaging:**
   - Schedule follow-up ECG in one month to monitor any changes in the ST-T pattern on lead V6.

3. **Recommendations:**
   - Patient should avoid further exertion until advised otherwise.
   - Monitor for worsening symptoms, such as increased chest pain or shortness of breath.

### **Follow-Up Instructions**
The patient is instructed to return for follow-up in one month for the ECG and to report any significant changes in their condition within 24 hours. If chest pain worsens or if there are new symptoms like fatigue or dyspnea, the patient should seek immediate medical attention.
