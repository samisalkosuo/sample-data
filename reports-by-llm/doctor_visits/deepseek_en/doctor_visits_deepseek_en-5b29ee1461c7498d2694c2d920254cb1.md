**Clinic Location:** Kauhava, New Zealand

### **Chief Complaint**
The patient is a 51-year-old male who presented with chest pain related to recent weight-bearing activity. The pain began approximately three days prior and has been progressively worsening since the last physical examination.

---

### **History of Present Illness (HPI)**
The patient reported experiencing mild, intermittent chest discomfort that radiated to his jaw and led to pressure or squeezing in the center of his chest. He described it as a "squeezing" pain that had been relieved with rest but worsened when he exerted himself. The pain was not acute but persistent enough to interfere with daily activities.

Onset: Approximately three days prior, following increased physical activity during a family outing. The pain was accompanied by mild nausea and sweating, which worsened as the intensity of the chest discomfort increased.

### **Physical Examination Findings**
- **Vital Signs:** Blood pressure slightly elevated (130/85 mmHg), heart rate tachycardic (~92 bpm), and no signs of respiratory distress.
- **Lung Exam:** Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezing or crackles noted.
- **Abdomen:** Soft, non-tender, with no hepatosplenomegaly.
- **Neck:** No visible edema or thyroid elevation.
- **Extremities:** No cyanosis or distended vessels.

No acute distress signs were observed during the physical examination. The patient reported a slight increase in heart rate during exertion but no palpitations or other cardiovascular symptoms.

### **Assessment/Diagnosis**
Based on the patient's chief complaint, history of present illness, and physical examination findings, the primary diagnosis considered was **mild angina pectoris**. The pain was described as exertional and associated with difficulty during weight-bearing activity. No acute distress or emergency-level symptoms were present.

Risk factors identified included a history of hypertension (diagnosed 10 years prior) and a family history of cardiovascular disease, which contribute to the patient's increased vulnerability to angina pectoris.

### **Plan / Treatment**
- **Medications:** The patient was prescribed **nitroglycerin 0.625 mg every 5 seconds** via a non-invasive delivery system (NID) to manage chest pain during exertion.
- **Evaluations:** A routine ECG was recommended to monitor heart rate variability during physical activity and rule out any arrhythmias or cardiac risk factors.

No major procedures were identified as necessary at this time, given the severity level of 4. The patient is advised to monitor symptoms closely and return for follow-up in two weeks if chest pain persists despite current management.

---

### **Follow-Up Instructions**
- **Next Visit:** Schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to reassess symptoms and review treatment progress.
- **Medication Review:** Monitor the effectiveness of nitroglycerin and consider increasing dosage if needed.
- **Symptom Monitoring:** The patient should report any worsening chest pain or new symptoms (e.g., shortness of breath, nausea) within 48 hours.
