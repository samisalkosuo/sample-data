### **Chief Complaint**
The patient is a 37-year-old male who presented with chest pain (angina-like) that started two days prior and worsened upon physical exertion. The patient reported difficulty breathing, which became more pronounced during activity.

---

### **History of Present Illness (HPI)**
The patient described the onset of chest pain as a gradual increase in discomfort over the past couple of days. It began after engaging in moderate exercise and escalated significantly when he ran for about 10 minutes. He also mentioned experiencing shortness of breath, which became more pronounced during exertion. The patient noted no prior significant health issues or known medical conditions.

### **Physical Examination Findings**
Upon arrival, the patient appeared slightly flushed and reported a dry cough. His vital signs were within normal limits (BP: 120/80 mmHg, HR: 78 bpm). A thorough physical examination revealed tachycardia upon exertion, mild wheezing on inspection, and no other notable findings.

### **Assessment / Diagnosis**
The primary diagnosis was suspected angina. The patient's symptoms were consistent with stress-induced chest pain. Further evaluation included an EKG, which showed a normal sinus rhythm but elevated heart rate during exertion (140 bpm). No signs of arrhythmia or ischemia were observed.

### **Plan / Treatment**
The attending physician recommended starting with rest and non-invasive management:
- Monitor oxygen saturation via finger oximeter.
- Advise the patient to avoid further physical activity until symptoms stabilize.
- Schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks for reassessment if symptoms persist.

If symptoms do not improve or worsen, the patient will be referred to a cardiologist for further evaluation, including an ECHOCARDIOGRAM and stress test.

---

### **Follow-up Instructions**
The patient is advised to return for follow-up in two weeks. If symptoms improve without resolution of chest pain, no further action is needed. However, if symptoms worsen or new symptoms emerge (e.g., dizziness, fainting), the patient should report immediately.

Monitor vital signs closely and inform the healthcare provider if any significant changes occur.
