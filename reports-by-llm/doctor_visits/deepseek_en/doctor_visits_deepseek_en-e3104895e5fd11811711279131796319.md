**Visit Summary**

**Visit Date:** 29.07.2025  
**Clinic or Hospital Location:** Kihniö

### **Chief Complaint**
The patient is a 61-year-old male presenting with chest pain, described as sharp and constant, lasting approximately 3 minutes before onset. The pain began in the left胸 region and radiated to the jawline. He reported no prior episode of similar pain.

---

### **History of Present Illness (HPI)**
The patient has a history of mild hypertension and diabetes, which may contribute to his sensitivity to stress or physical exertion. Onlookers noted he appeared stressed upon arrival but did not exhibit any signs of pre-existing heart disease during the initial encounter. He denied recent changes in diet, exercise, or smoking habits.

### **Physical Examination Findings**
Upon arrival, the patient was alert and oriented, though his heart rate and blood pressure were elevated due to the acute nature of the chest pain. He reported difficulty breathing upon exertion but did not exhibit signs of anaphylaxis or other allergies. A thorough physical examination revealed no palpable ejected edema, and no wheezing was observed during auscultation bilaterally.

A chest X-ray showed wheezing in the left lung field with effort, consistent with asthma-related symptoms. Blood work indicated a normal EKG with an elevated heart rate and blood pressure, but no signs of arrhythmias were detected.

### **Assessment / Diagnosis**
The patient's presentation aligns with an acute episode of coronary artery disease (CAD) or STEMI (ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction). The combination of chest pain, radiating jaw pain, elevated heart rate, and wheezing suggests a possible airway obstruction. Given the severity level 2, immediate intervention is required.

---

### **Plan / Treatment**
- **Immediate Actions:** Stop any medications or interventions currently being administered.
- **Airway Management:** Secure the airway if necessary to prevent further distress.
- **Electrocardiogram (ECG):** Begin monitoring for signs of arrhythmias within 15 minutes.
- **Medical EmerGENCY:** If signs of a STEMI are confirmed, initiate treatment with NGAS (Nasal, Intravenous, and Subcutaneous) to open the airway. If no STEMI is detected, consider treating as an acute CAD.

---

### **Follow-up Instructions**
The patient will be referred to an Emergency Department or Urgent Care Center within 24-48 hours for further evaluation. Follow-up appointments with a cardiologist are scheduled in 72 hours if the diagnosis remains tentative.
