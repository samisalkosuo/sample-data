---

### **History of Present Illness (HPI)**
The patient reported a sudden onset of chest pain located in the right upper quadrant, which began approximately 30 minutes ago. She noted radiating discomfort to her left arm and back. She described the pain as sharp and progressively worsening. She stated that it started without any prior warning and worsened rapidly. The patient also reported shortness of breath ( grade 4/10) and a feeling of fainting (grade 3/10). No history of recent trauma or significant medical conditions was provided.

### **Physical Examination Findings**
Upon arrival, the patient appeared slightly palpable in her upper abdomen. A thorough physical examination revealed a thrill in the right upper quadrant, suggesting possible appendicitis or a related condition. There was no palpable tenderness at the costophrenic area (C5-C6). Blood pressure was 130/85 mmHg, and heart rate was 92 bpm.

### **Assessment / Diagnosis**
Based on the patient's presentation, the primary diagnosis considered was acute appendicitis. No signs of perforation were identified during examination. Additionally, the chest pain was consistent with possible coronary artery disease (CAD), which could explain the radiating discomfort and shortness of breath. The absence of life-threatening symptoms ruled out immediate resuscitation.

### **Plan / Treatment**
The patient was admitted to the emergency department for further evaluation. The following measures were taken:
- Intravenous fluids to address potential dehydration.
- Oxygen therapy via nasal cannula (2 L/h) to manage hypoxia.
- Close monitoring of vital signs, including blood pressure and heart rate.

No immediate medications or procedures were administered at this stage. An ECG was scheduled for the next 24 hours to assess for signs of STE elevation changes indicative of a potential coronary event.

### **Follow-up Instructions**
The patient is advised to return to the emergency department in 24 hours if her symptoms persist or worsen, particularly if she experiences severe chest pain, increased heart rate, or shortness of breath. If she has any concerns about her condition, she should contact her general practitioner immediately.

A follow-up appointment with her GP will be scheduled within 7 days to review her symptoms and treatment progress.
