### **Physical Examination Findings**

- **Chest Exam:** Mild erythema of the left lateral chest, localized to the left arm area. No wheezing or crackles are heard.
- **EKG:** ST-segment elevation in leads II and III (ST-segment elevations: 2 mm in lead II; 1.5 mm in lead III), suggesting an acute myocardial infarction (MI) of the infernal wall.
- **Breathing:** Mild tachypnea on exertion, with no cyanotic绀绀 appearance noted.

### **Assessment / Diagnosis**
The patient’s presentation is consistent with an acute myocardial infarction (ST-segment elevation), likely due to a massive embolism or coronary artery disease. Given the severity of her symptoms and the presence of ST-segment changes on EKG, immediate intervention is required.
