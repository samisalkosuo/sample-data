### **Chief Complaint**

---

### **History of Present Illness (HPI)**
The patient reported experiencing a sore throat for approximately two days prior to her visit, which worsened slightly on the third day. She described the sore throat as "mild to moderate" in intensity, accompanied by a general feeling of fatigue that had been present over the past week. The fatigue was described as "gradual and persistent," with no significant increase in severity since the onset of symptoms.

The patient noted that her sore throat began after she returned home from a weekend trip where she stayed in contact with family members who were experiencing colder weather. She mentioned that her fatigue had been exacerbated by stress related to work and personal responsibilities, which she described as "moderate."

No history of fever, cough, or other respiratory symptoms was provided during the visit.

The patient appeared well overall in general appearance, with no significant signs of illness. Her vital signs were within normal limits upon examination (BP: 128/76 mmHg; HR: 78 bpm; RR: 16 breaths/min; Temperature: 98.4Â°F). 

The physical examination revealed mild erythema (redness) around the mouth and throat areas, likely related to the sore throat. There was no evidence of edema or other systemic findings.

### **Assessment / Diagnosis**
Based on the patient's chief complaint, history of present illness, and physical examination findings, the primary diagnosis considered is a "mild viral respiratory infection" (likely influenza or COVID-19). The sore throat and fatigue are attributed to postnasal drip from the upper respiratory tract infection. No other significant medical concerns were identified.

### **Plan / Treatment**
The patient has been prescribed the following:
- **Medications:** An antihistamine (e.g., Claritin) to manage potential allergic symptoms.
- **Rest:** advised to rest and avoid activities that may exacerbate fatigue.
- **Symptom Monitoring:** The patient is encouraged to monitor her symptoms at home, including any worsening of the sore throat or fatigue.

No further diagnostic testing or procedures are required unless symptoms worsen.

### **Follow-up Instructions**
The patient should return for follow-up in two weeks if she experiences:
1. Severe fatigue.
2. Worsening of the sore throat.
3. Any signs of fever, cough, or other respiratory symptoms.

The patient is also reminded to maintain her current immunizations and to monitor any changes in her condition.
