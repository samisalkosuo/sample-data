### **History of Present Illness (HPI)**
- **Sore throat:** Onset two days ago; initially mild, worsening over the weekend.
- **Difficulty swallowing:** Worst at night or when attempting to drink.
- **Other symptoms:** No fever, cough, or other systemic signs. No history of significant past medical conditions, allergies, or substance use (moderate alcohol consumption noted).

### **Assessment / Diagnosis**
Based on the patient's presentation and clinical findings, the primary diagnosis is considered to be a mild throat infection with possible post-pharyngeal edema contributing to the difficulty in swallowing. No evidence suggests a bacterial or viral infection requiring hospitalization, nor does it present as a life-threatening emergency.

---

### **Plan / Treatment**
- **Medications:** Prescribe amoxicillin-clavulanate 250 mg orally once daily for 7 days (to cover possible strep throat and reduce complications).
- **Follow-up:** Monitor symptoms over the next 48 hours. If no improvement or worsening, consult a healthcare provider.
- **Additional instructions:** Stay hydrated, avoid further irritants (alcohol, spicy foods), and monitor for any signs of worsening symptoms.

---

### **Follow-up Instructions**
- **Next follow-up:** In two days, the patient should report any persistent symptoms or changes in his condition. If symptoms do not improve, he should call to reschedule an appointment.
- **Additional advice:** Stay hydrated and avoid further irritants (alcohol, spicy foods) as they may exacerbate the sore throat.
