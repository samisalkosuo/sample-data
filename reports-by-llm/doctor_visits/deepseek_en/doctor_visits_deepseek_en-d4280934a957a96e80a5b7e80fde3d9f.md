### **Assessment / Diagnosis**  
Based on the patient’s complaints and physical examination findings, the primary diagnosis is **restrictive cardiomyopathy (ejection fraction 35%)**, likely secondary to chronic heart failure. Secondary diagnoses include **chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)** and **mild dehydration**.

### **Plan / Treatment**  
The treatment plan includes:  
1. **Oral rehydration solution (ORS) with electrolytes** to address the mild dehydration.  
2. **Diuretic therapy** if edema persists, as seen in the legs.  
3. Close monitoring of vital signs, including blood pressure and heart rate, to ensure stability.

### **Follow-up Instructions**  
The patient is advised to bring any new symptoms of increased fatigue or shortness of breath to their next follow-up appointment. He should continue to monitor his fluid intake and output and adhere strictly to the prescribed oral rehydration and diuretic regimen. Follow-up will be scheduled in 2 weeks.
