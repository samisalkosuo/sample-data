### **History of Present Illness (HPI)**
The patient reported an allergic reaction triggered by contact with pollen during her daily activities. She stated that she was outside in a park when the reaction began.

### **Physical Examination Findings**
Upon arrival, the patient was conscious but appeared significantly dehydrated.

### **Assessment / Diagnosis**
The patient’s presentation aligns with anaphylaxis, a severe allergic reaction that requires immediate treatment. Clinical signs of anaphylaxis included systemic itching, swelling, and transient hypotension. The absence of acute respiratory distress and no evidence of pre-hypovolemia suggested that the patient was adequately hydrated.

2. **IV Fluids:** Initiate intravenous fluids if not already begun, to restore hydration and oxygenation.

4. **Monitoring:** Continue close monitoring for signs of anaphylaxis, including difficulty breathing or skin hypochromia.

### **Follow-up Instructions**
