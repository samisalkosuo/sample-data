**Visit Summary**  
**Visit Date:** November 30, 2024  
**Clinic or Hospital Location:** Tuusniemi

### **Chief Complaint**  
The patient is a 16-year-old female who presented to the clinic with a mild rash on her arms and legs. She described it as itchy and red but noted that she has never experienced such symptoms before, indicating this may be her first encounter with a medical professional.

---

### **History of Present Illness (HPI)**  
The patient reported experiencing a localized, itchy rash on her arms and legs approximately 48 hours prior to the visit. She stated it was caused by a minor cut she received recently from a small object. The rash began as a small red spot that gradually expanded outward. She described the itching as mild but persistent, particularly around the nightime. No other symptoms were reported at this time.

### **Physical Examination Findings**  
The patient appeared healthy and in good spirits, with no history of allergies or skin conditions. Her vital signs were normal (BP 120/80 mmHg, HR 78 bpm). Upon examination, she had a mild elevated heart rate, which the provider noted could be attributed to nervousness about her first medical visit.

The primary finding was the presence of a small, red, itchy rash localized to her arms and legs. No other notable findings were observed during the physical examination.

### **Assessment / Diagnosis**  
Based on the patient’s presentation, the primary diagnosis is likely **allergic contact dermatitis or irritant contact hypersensitivity**, most likely secondary to recent exposure to a minor cut or irritant. No evidence of systemic infection or other serious conditions was identified.

The rash was not considered life-threatening and did not exhibit signs of spreading or worsening at the time of examination.

### **Plan / Treatment**  
1. **Topical Treatment:** Apply a mild, non-irritating ointment (e.g., petroleum jelly) to the affected areas to reduce itching and discomfort.
2. **Monitoring:** Monitor the rash for any signs of improvement or worsening over the next 48 hours.
3. **Follow-up:** The patient will be scheduled for a follow-up visit in two weeks to reassess the condition.

---

### **Follow-up Instructions**  
- Monitor the rash at home and report any changes, worsening, or new symptoms within 24 hours of the visit.
- If the rash does not improve by the next follow-up appointment (scheduled for December 7, 2024), return to the clinic for further evaluation.
