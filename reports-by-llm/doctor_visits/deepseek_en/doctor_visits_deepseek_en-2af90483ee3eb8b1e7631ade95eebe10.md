### **Assessment / Diagnosis**
Based on the patient’s complaints and physical examination findings, the primary diagnosis considered is **hypertension** (diagnosed based on elevated blood pressure) and/or **hypotension** (due to possible orthostatic hypotension or dehydration). No acute life-threatening signs were identified.

### **Plan / Treatment**
The treatment plan includes:
- **Oral medications:** Lisinopril 10 mg twice daily to control hypertension.
- **IV fluids:** To address potential dehydration and maintain blood pressure stability (to be administered as needed).
- **Observation:** Close monitoring of blood pressure, heart rate, and symptoms over the next 24 hours to rule out other causes such as thyroid dysfunction or anemia.

### **Follow-up Instructions**
The patient is advised to take her prescribed medications regularly. Blood pressure should be monitored at home for the next two weeks, and she should report any significant changes in symptoms during this period. A follow-up appointment is scheduled for 14 days from today (February 29th) to review treatment progress.
