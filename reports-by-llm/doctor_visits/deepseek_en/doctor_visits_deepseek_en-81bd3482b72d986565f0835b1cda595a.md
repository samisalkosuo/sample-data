### **History of Present Illness (HPI)**
The patient reported experiencing a localized, erythematous rash on his upper back area about two weeks prior to presentation. On examination, the rash was approximately 5 cm in diameter, with no underlying ulceration or oozing. The rash began on the right side of the back and spread slightly to the left during the last 48 hours. The patient described the rash as "itchy" and noted a gradual increase in discomfort over the past few days.

No significant precipitating factors were identified, with no known exposure to environmental allergens or irritants. The patient reported no history of similar rashes in the past, and no other symptoms such as fatigue, fever, or wheezing during the visit.

### **Physical Examination Findings**
Upon physical examination, the patient was found to have a mild erythematous rash located on the upper back area (right side). No signs of systemic infection were observed. The patient's vital signs were within normal limits: blood pressure slightly elevated at 120/75 mmHg, pulse rate 84 bpm, and respiratory rates at 16 breaths per minute.

No wheezing or other respiratory symptoms were noted during the visit.

### **Assessment/Diagnosis**
Based on the patient's history, physical examination findings, and environmental exposure to potential allergens (e.g., pollen), the most likely diagnosis is a "Localized allergic reaction" secondary to environmental factors. No systemic disease was identified.

---

### **Plan/Treatment**
The plan of care includes:
1. **Topical corticosteroids:** To reduce inflammation and itching at the site of the rash.
2. **Antihistamines:** To alleviate symptoms such as wheezing (if present) or any other respiratory symptoms.
3. **Monitoring:** Close observation for any signs of worsening symptoms, such as increased erythema or systemic signs.

No major procedures are anticipated due to the mild nature of the complaint.

---

### **Follow-up Instructions**
The patient is advised to return for follow-up in two weeks. During this period, the patient should monitor for any worsening signs of the rash and report any significant changes in symptoms. If the rash persists or becomes more severe, the patient should contact their healthcare provider immediately.
