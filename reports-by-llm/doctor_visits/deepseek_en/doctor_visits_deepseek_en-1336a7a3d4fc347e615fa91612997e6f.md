### **Assessment / Diagnosis**
The patient presents with signs of acute dehydrating causes, including turgor in her eyes and respiratory distress. Her high fever suggests an underlying bacterial or viral etiology. Blood tests will be conducted to differentiate between a bacterial (e.g., E. coli) or viral (e.g., influenza) cause.

### **Plan / Treatment**
- **Intravenous Fluids:** Administer 1000 mL of normal saline over 30 minutes to address dehydration.
- **Oxygen Therapy:** Provide hyperoxic oxygen therapy at 21% to alleviate respiratory distress.
- **Antibiotics:** Initiate empiric antibiotic therapy (e.g., amoxicillin-clavulanate) based on blood culture results. Consider a penicillin allergy test due to her age and potential exposure to antibiotics in the past.

### **Follow-up Instructions**
The patient is advised to return for follow-up in two weeks with the following:
- Blood counts (white cell count, creatinine)
- Results of the penicillin allergy test

She should avoid strenuous activities and monitor her symptoms closely. If she experiences severe respiratory distress or a drop in blood pressure, she should seek immediate medical attention.
