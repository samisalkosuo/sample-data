### **Chief Complaint**
The patient is a 104-year-old female who presented to the emergency department with a severe respiratory distress and difficulty breathing, accompanied by chest pain and trouble swallowing. She described experiencing an allergic reaction approximately 15-20 minutes prior to arrival.

---

### **History of Present Illness (HPI)**
The patient reported experiencing an allergic reaction about 15-20 minutes before arriving at the emergency department. She stated that she was exposed to a substance she is hypersensitive to, which caused her to experience a rapid onset of symptoms. Her main symptoms included:
- Severe difficulty breathing due to an airway obstruction.
- Chest pain and shortness of breath, likely related to vasoconstriction.
- Difficulty swallowing, possibly due to airway swelling from the allergic reaction.

The patient described a visible red and raised tongue with a small, firm mass at the base. She denied any other symptoms or signs of distress. She stated she had no known allergies but mentioned that she is hypersensitive to certain allergens.

### **Physical Examination Findings**
Upon examination:
- The patient appeared distressed, with tachycardia and increased heart rate.
- Her airway was visible but appeared congested due to swelling from the allergic reaction.
- There were no signs of acute hypoxia or respiratory failure.
- No other notable findings were observed.

---

### **Assessment / Diagnosis**
Based on her presentation and history, the primary diagnosis is an allergic reaction (anaphylaxis). The patientâ€™s airway obstruction was confirmed by the visible mass on her tongue. No life-threatening complications were identified at this time.

Additional findings included:
- Mild elevation in blood pressure.
- Normal vital signs overall.

---

### **Plan / Treatment**
Immediate actions include:
1. Administering epinephrine subcutaneously to relieve the allergic reaction.
2. Securing the airway with a tracheal tube if necessary, pending further evaluation.
3. Monitoring for any signs of arrhythmia or respiratory distress.

The patient will be kept in the emergency department for continued observation until the allergic reaction resolves and her airway is cleared.

### **Follow-up Instructions**
- The patient should take oral antihistamines to reduce the likelihood of future allergic reactions.
- She should review her current allergy immunization schedule, including any shots she may no longer need.
- A follow-up appointment will be scheduled at the emergency department for further evaluation and management if necessary.
