**Visit Summary**

**Visit Date:** 23.12.2023  
**Clinic or Hospital Location:** Kannonkosi  

---

### **Chief Complaint**
The patient is a 101-year-old male who presented with severe, uncontrolled breathing difficulties (tachypnea) and a high fever of approximately 40Â°C. The onset of these symptoms was sudden, and he described them as progressively worsening without any prior warning.

---

### **History of Present Illness (HPI)**
The patient has a history of chronic respiratory conditions, including asthma managed with inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting beta-agonists. He also suffers from pre-existing cardiovascular disease, which includes hypertension and diabetes. On this occasion, he was exposed to an unknown allergen during a visit to the clinic for a routine check-up. The exposure triggered an allergic reaction, leading to the sudden onset of his respiratory distress.

---

### **Physical Examination Findings**
Upon arrival, the patient is conscious but disoriented and demonstrates signs of acute respiratory failure (tachypnea, cyanotic lips, and cool extremities). Blood pressure is elevated at 140/90 mmHg. The physical examination reveals a systemic presentation consistent with an allergic reaction: generalized urticaria, rash, and mild edema in the extremities.

---

### **Assessment / Diagnosis**
The patient's acute respiratory failure and signs of shock suggest a life-threatening allergic anaphylaxis. Given his advanced age and pre-existing cardiovascular disease, immediate intervention is critical to prevent complications such as hypotension, respiratory arrest, or even death.

---

### **Plan / Treatment**
1. **Immediate Medical Interventions:**
   - Intravenous epinephrine (0.3 mg) to treat the anaphylaxis.
   - Blood gas analysis to monitor oxygen saturation and carbon dioxide levels.
   - Administration of furosemide to address fluid overload.

2. **Monitoring:**
   - Close monitoring for signs of shock, including hypotension or tachycardia.
   - Immediate call for emergency services if respiratory distress worsens or if hypotension is unresponsive to treatment.

3. **Long-term Follow-up:**
   - Referral to an allergist for further evaluation and management of the allergic reaction.
   - Regular review of cardiovascular health due to pre-existing conditions.

---

### **Follow-up Instructions**
- Secure the patient in a stable condition with appropriate mechanical ventilation if necessary.
- Call emergency services immediately if respiratory distress does not improve or worsen.
- Follow up with the allergist within 24 hours for reassessment and management of the allergic reaction.
- Monitor for any signs of complications, such as hypotension or respiratory arrest.
