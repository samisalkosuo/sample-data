**Visit Date:** 28.04.2024  
**Clinic Location:** Inari

### **Chief Complaint**
The patient is a 49-year-old female who presents with complaints of lower back pain over the past three days, which has progressively worsened. She describes radiating leg pain and an inability to sit for more than five minutes without experiencing discomfort.

---

### **History of Present Illness (HPI)**
The patient reports a sudden onset of low-back pain approximately two hours prior to her arrival at the clinic. The pain is described as intermittent with periods of relief, but it has now become constant and significantly impacting her ability to sit or stand for extended periods. She mentions that the pain radiates to her legs, causing discomfort in her thighs and calves. No history of similar episodes in the past month is provided.

The patient denies any fever, chills, or other systemic symptoms. She states she has not consumed alcohol or smoked recently. She also reports no recent changes in weight or activity level.

### **Physical Examination Findings**
Upon arrival, the patient appears fatigued and slightly disheveled due to the intensity of her pain. She is unable to sit for more than five minutes without experiencing discomfort. A thorough physical examination reveals localized tenderness in the lower back area (C5-C6), with no palpable masses or signs of organomechanical instability.

There is mild edema noted in the legs, consistent with fluid retention from the lower extremities. No signs of respiratory distress, cardiovascular compromise, or joint issues are present.

### **Assessment / Diagnosis**
Based on the patient’s chief complaint, HPI, and physical examination findings, the primary diagnosis considered is a **disk herniation at C5-C6**. This condition is consistent with the sudden onset of low-back pain and radiating leg discomfort, which has been stable for the past 48 hours.

Additional considerations include degenerative disc disease, spondylolisthesis, or radicular neuritis, but these are less likely given the patient’s age and lack of systemic symptoms.

---

### **Plan / Treatment**
The immediate plan involves:
1. **Imaging:** A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine will be performed to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other causes.
2. **Pain Management:** The patient will be prescribed light-duty nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication (NSAIDs) for pain relief, with a reminder to consult her healthcare provider if adverse effects occur.
3. **Activity Modification:** The patient is advised to avoid activities that may exacerbate her low-back pain and to limit weight-bearing on the lower extremities.

The patient will be followed up in two weeks for imaging results and treatment response.

---

### **Follow-up Instructions**
- **Next Follow-up:** In two weeks, the patient should return for imaging guidance. If imaging confirms a disk herniation, further treatment options may include physical therapy or spinal injections.
- **Activity Modification:** The patient is advised to avoid prolonged sitting or standing without support and to limit weight-bearing on the lower extremities unless directed otherwise by her healthcare provider.
- **Pain Management:** If pain persists or worsens, the patient should contact her healthcare provider immediately for reassessment.
