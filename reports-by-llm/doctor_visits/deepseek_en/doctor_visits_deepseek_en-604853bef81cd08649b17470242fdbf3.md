### **History of Present Illness (HPI)**

### **Physical Examination Findings**  
Upon examination, the medical team observed a small red burn located on the left knee of the 5-year-old female. The burn was painless at rest and became more uncomfortable when the leg was moved. No systemic signs of infection, fever, or wheezing were identified. Vitals were normal.

---

### **Assessment / Diagnosis**  
The primary diagnosis is a minor first-degree burn on the left knee. Given the absence of systemic symptoms and the thickness of the burn (less than 4 mm), no further diagnostic workup was necessary at this time.

---

### **Plan / Treatment**  
- Clean the burn site with saline solution to promote healing.  
- Monitor for any signs of worsening discomfort or changes in color or texture.  
- No additional medications, procedures, or referrals are required at this time.

### **Follow-up Instructions**  
The child should be monitored for 24 hours following the application of saline solution. If the burn site becomes more uncomfortable, changes in color, or if there is any渗出 (exudate), the patient should be referred back to the clinic for further evaluation. The medical team will reassess the situation at the next convenient opportunity.
