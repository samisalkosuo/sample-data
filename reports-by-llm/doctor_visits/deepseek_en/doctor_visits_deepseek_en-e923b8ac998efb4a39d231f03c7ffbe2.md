### **History of Present Illness (HPI)**

### **Assessment/Diagnosis**
Based on the patient's complaints and physical examination, the primary diagnosis considered is an acute chest syndrome. Further evaluation may be needed to differentiate between heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFP EF) or other potential causes of chest discomfort.
