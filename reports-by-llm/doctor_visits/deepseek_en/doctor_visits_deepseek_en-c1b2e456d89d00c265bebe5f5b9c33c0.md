### **Chief Complaint**  
The patient is a 102-year-old female who presented to the emergency department with complaints of severe hives, difficulty breathing, swelling around her face and neck, and trouble breathing. She stated that she had noticed the hives about two hours prior but did not seek immediate medical attention.

---

### **History of Present Illness (HPI)**  
The patient reported a sudden onset of symptoms, which began approximately two hours prior to her arrival at the clinic. The primary complaint was the appearance of severe,Itchable hives on her arms and legs, which spread rapidly across her body. She described difficulty breathing, with exertion making it worse, and noted swelling in her face and neck. She also mentioned that she had experienced a similar reaction to an antihistamine in the past, but this was the first time it had been administered recently.

The patient denied any other symptoms or recent exposures. She stated that she was taking an antihistamine for seasonal allergies when the reaction occurred. She is otherwise asymptomatic and has no history of severe allergic reactions.

### **Physical Examination Findings**  
Upon arrival, the patient appeared cool to the touch, consistent with hypothermia. Her vital signs were stable, but her blood pressure was slightly elevated (140/90 mmHg). She had a normal heart rate (88 bpm), which was slightly elevated due to anxiety from the anticipated severity of her condition.

The physical examination revealed prominent,Itchable hives across her arms and legs, as well as swelling in her face and neck. There were no signs of respiratory distress on auscultation or breath sounds. The patient reported that she had noticed the hives about two hours prior to her visit but did not seek medical attention at the time.

### **Assessment / Diagnosis**  
Based on the patient’s presentation, history, and physical examination findings, the primary diagnosis is **severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis)**. The symptoms are consistent with anaphylactic anaphylaxis, characterized by hives, respiratory distress, and swelling of extremities.

Given her advanced age (102 years) and potential for hypovolemia or shock due to the severity of her condition, immediate medical intervention is required.

### **Plan / Treatment**  
The patient will receive **immediate intravenous epinephrine (0.3 mcg/kg)** to treat her anaphylactic reaction. This will be administered subcutaneously via a syringe lock. The following measures are also planned:  

1. **Airway management:** Ensure the airway is clear of obstructions, as difficulty breathing and swelling may obstruct it.  
2. **Breathing assistance:** If necessary, provide mechanical ventilation or assist with breathing until the anaphylactic reaction subsides.  
3. **Cooling measures:** The patient will be kept cool to avoid further fluid retention and potential hypothermia.

The patient is advised not to take any antihistamines without medical supervision in case of ongoing symptoms.

---

### **Follow-up Instructions**  
1. **Immediate follow-up:** The patient should call the clinic or emergency services if she experiences severe swelling, breathing difficulties, or any signs of respiratory distress.  
2. **Avoid further exposure:** She should avoid contact with the allergen (the antihistamine) until advised by a healthcare provider.  
3. **Medication review:** She will be prescribed an antihistamine to prevent future reactions and monitor its effectiveness under supervision.

The patient is asymptomatic otherwise, but close monitoring of her condition is recommended due to her advanced age and potential for rapid progression of symptoms.
