### **Chief Complaint**
The patient is a 27-year-old male who presented to the emergency department with a sudden onset of severe chest pain, described as substernal and sharp, worsening with exertion. The patient reported that the pain radiated to his back and jaw and was accompanied by nausea, shortness of breath, and a feeling of fainting. He stated that he had been running up a flight of stairs when the episode occurred.

---

### **History of Present Illness (HPI)**
The patient described the onset of his symptoms as sudden and unprovoked, occurring approximately 10 minutes after he began ascending the stairs. There was no history of chest pain in the past year, but he reported experiencing occasional discomfort in the lower abdomen in the past few months. The pain was described as sharp and constant, with a significant increase in intensity when he exerted himself.

The patient denied any recent changes in his lifestyle or health status. He reported that he had been feeling generally well prior to this episode and did not consume any substances that could cause allergic reactions or anaphylaxis.

### **Physical Examination Findings**
Upon arrival, the patient was conscious but appeared extremely distressed. His vital signs indicated a critical situation: blood pressure was significantly low (80/40 mmHg), heart rate was rapid and irregular (150 bpm), and he exhibited palpitations. He reported a feeling of fainting and stated that his breathing became labored.

The physical examination revealed tachycardia, bradycardia in the extremities, and signs of shock, including cyanotic mouth and lips. There was no evidence of anaphylaxis on initial assessment, but the patient’s condition required immediate intervention.

### **Assessment / Diagnosis**
Based on the patient’s presentation and physical examination findings, the primary diagnosis is **Cardiac Arrest** with a possible ECG abnormality noted during the examination. Secondary diagnoses include acute hypoxia and possible anaphylaxis (though no evidence of such was immediately apparent).

### **Plan / Treatment**
The immediate plan involves CPR to restore spontaneous circulation, followed by defibrillator use if available. Blood pressure will be controlled with appropriate medications, including a beta-blocker or vasopressor as needed. The patient will be monitored for signs of shock and stabilized until professional resuscitation can be administered.

### **Follow-up Instructions**
The patient should be referred to the emergency services immediately for further evaluation and potential transport to an ambulance. The family has been notified of the incident, and a follow-up appointment will be scheduled at the earliest opportunity once the patient’s condition is stabilized or any changes in his condition are noted.
