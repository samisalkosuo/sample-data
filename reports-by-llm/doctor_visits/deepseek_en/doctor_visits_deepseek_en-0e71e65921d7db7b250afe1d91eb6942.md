### **Chief Complaint**
The patient, a 97-year-old male, presented with sudden onset of severe chest pain, accompanied by shortness of breath and difficulty breathing. He reported feeling unwell earlier but had not sought immediate treatment.

### **History of Present Illness (HPI)**
The patient described experiencing chest pain that started abruptly, lasting approximately 5 minutes. He noted a significant increase in heart rate to about 120 beats per minute and shortness of breath, which worsened with exertion. He recalled feeling fatigued earlier but did not pursue medical attention promptly.

### **Physical Examination Findings**
Upon arrival, the patient exhibited a strong radial pulse (128 bpm) and tachycardia (130 bpm). His breathing was rapid (30 breaths per minute), and he appeared hypotensive with a blood pressure of 98/62 mmHg. He denied fever or chills but reported cold extremities, suggesting possible hypothermia from exposure to cold air.

### **Assessment / Diagnosis**
The patient's symptoms were consistent with an acute, severe cardiac emergency. The chest pain was classified as ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), with a high likelihood of a massive coronary artery occlusion. Given his advanced age and presentation, the primary concern was immediate intervention to prevent further complications.

### **Plan / Treatment**
- **Immediate CPR:** If cardiac arrest occurs, initiate CPR immediately.
- **Airway Clearance:** Clear airways promptly using mouth-to-nose or face-to-face techniques.
- **Oxygen Administration:** Provide high-flow oxygen (10-20 L/min) via non-rebreathing mask to maintain adequate oxygenation.
- **Call Emergency Services:** Remain calm and contact emergency medical services immediately upon arrival at the scene.

### **Follow-up Instructions**
The patient should rest at home with moderate fluid intake. He is advised to monitor for signs of shock or arrhythmias. If he experiences severe chest pain, shortness of breath, or fainting, he should seek immediate medical attention. Follow-up with the attending physician in 2-3 days.
