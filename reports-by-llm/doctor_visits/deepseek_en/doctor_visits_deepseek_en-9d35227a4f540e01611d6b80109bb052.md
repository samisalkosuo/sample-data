### **Chief Complaint**
The patient is a 91-year-old male who presented to Eura for evaluation of a mild rash located on his face, arms, and upper extremities. The rash has been present for approximately two weeks and began after the patient experienced increased soap usage in his bathroom.

---

### **History of Present Illness (HPI)**
The patient reported a localized, red, slightly raised Rash on his face, arms, and upper arms. He stated it started after using more soap than usual in his bathroom. No other symptoms were reported, including fatigue or itching elsewhere on the body.

---

### **Physical Examination Findings**
Upon examination, the patient was normothermic (36.8°C) and appeared alert with no visible signs of distress. His skin showed a mild Rash on the face, arms, and upper extremities, which was consistent with localized telangiectatic varices. No other notable findings were observed.

---

### **Assessment / Diagnosis**
The patient’s Rash is likely due to Telangiectatic Varices (TV), a common condition in aging individuals characterized by small red, raised veins under the skin. Given his age and the mild presentation, no immediate intervention was deemed necessary unless the Rash becomes widespread or accompanied by other symptoms.

---

### **Plan / Treatment**
The patient will be treated with Over-the-Counter (OTC) Hydrocortisone Cream applied twice daily to alleviate any discomfort caused by the Rash. He is advised to monitor for improvement and consult a dermatologist if the Rash persists after two weeks.

---

### **Follow-up Instructions**
The patient should return for follow-up in approximately two weeks if the Rash remains unchanged. If he experiences worsening symptoms or new symptoms such as fatigue, itching, or fever, he should contact his healthcare provider immediately.
