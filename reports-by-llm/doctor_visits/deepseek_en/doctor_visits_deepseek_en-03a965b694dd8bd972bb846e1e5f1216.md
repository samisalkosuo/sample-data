### **Assessment / Diagnosis**  
Based on the patient’s chief complaint, history of illness, physical examination findings, and age, the primary diagnosis is **persistent cough with weight loss and fatigue (likely related to a lower respiratory infection)**. Given his advanced age, there is no evidence of acute decompensated heart failure or other severe complications.

---

### **Plan / Treatment**  
1. **Antibiotics:** Initiate empiric treatment with a 5-day course of oral cephalosporin (e.g., ceftriaxone and ceftazidime) to cover potential bacterial etiology.
2. **Follow-up:** Schedule a follow-up in 7 days to assess the response to treatment and reassess for any worsening symptoms or complications.

---

### **Follow-up Instructions**  
- The patient should return for follow-up in 7 days to evaluate the effectiveness of the antibiotics and reassess for any signs of worsening cough, increased fatigue, weight loss, or shortness of breath.
- If the patient experiences signs of respiratory failure (e.g., orthopnea, crackles bilaterally), fever, or significant weight loss, he should seek immediate medical attention.
