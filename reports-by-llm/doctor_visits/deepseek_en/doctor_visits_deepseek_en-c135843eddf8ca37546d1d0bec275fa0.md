### **Chief Complaint**
The patient is a 17-year-old female who presented with complaints of fatigue and shortness of breath over the past few days. She has no prior medical history or significant past medical history.

---

### **History of Present Illness (HPI)**
The patient reported experiencing mild to moderate fatigue, which began approximately two days ago. It is not related to any specific precipitating event but started after she had a stressful day at school. She also mentioned experiencing occasional shortness of breath, particularly during physical activity or when sitting still for extended periods.

No prior symptoms were reported by the patient. She has no history of chest pain, dizziness, or other respiratory issues. The onset of fatigue and shortness of breath was gradual and not accompanied by any acute exacerbating factors.

### **Physical Examination Findings**
Upon examination, the patient appeared slightly pale due to increased heart rate and breathing. Her blood pressure was noted to be slightly elevated (130/85 mmHg), but no other significant findings were observed during the physical exam. She had normal vital signs overall, including a normal body temperature.

### **Assessment / Diagnosis**
Based on her complaints of fatigue and shortness of breath, along with the absence of acute symptoms, the primary consideration was to rule out conditions that could cause stable but non-urgent medical issues. The patient's presentation aligns with a possible underlying stress response or functional dyspnea.

No specific pathophysiological processes were identified during the examination. Further evaluation is needed to determine if this is related to anemia, cardiovascular concerns, or another condition requiring further investigation.

### **Plan / Treatment**
The doctor has decided to monitor the patient's symptoms and perform a basic blood workup (e.g., complete blood count) to assess for iron deficiency or other nutritional deficiencies that could contribute to her fatigue. Additionally, she will be advised to keep track of her symptoms' duration and severity.

If no improvement occurs within 48 hours or if symptoms persist, further evaluation may be warranted. Stress management techniques, such as deep breathing exercises or mindfulness practices, have been recommended to address potential underlying stress-related issues.

---

### **Follow-up Instructions**
The patient is advised to return for follow-up in 2-3 days if her fatigue does not improve or if she experiences any significant worsening of symptoms. If she develops shortness of breath that is worse than before, she should contact the clinic immediately.
