### **Chief Complaint**  
The patient presented to the emergency department with a sudden collapse and unresponsive state, accompanied by severe chest pain that worsened rapidly to palpitations and then a brief but intense episode of unconsciousness. The patient reported feeling unwell around noon, initially experiencing mild chest discomfort.

---

### **History of Present Illness (HPI)**  
The patient is a 26-year-old female who presented with sudden onset of severe shortness of breath, accompanied by a rapid and irregular heart rate. She described feeling faint upon sitting up and reported an episode of unconsciousness lasting approximately one minute. The patient stated she had been experiencing mild chest discomfort for the past hour but did not previously report any significant health issues.

### **Physical Examination Findings**  
Upon arrival, the patient was conscious but unresponsive to verbal stimuli. She exhibited signs of shock with a low blood pressure (98/60 mmHg) and rapid heart rate (120 bpm). Oxygen saturation on room air was 92% on the right lung and 88% on the left. The patient appeared hypotensive, with no peripheral edema noted. She denied any recent trauma or exposure to medications.

### **Assessment / Diagnosis**  
The patient’s presentation is consistent with an acute, unprovoked medical emergency. The clinical findings strongly suggest a cardiac arrest due to either an undiagnosed arrhythmogenic condition or external causes (e.g., electric shock). Given the severity of the situation and the absence of any known risk factors for sudden cardiac arrest in this patient, immediate intervention is required.

### **Plan / Treatment**  
1. **CPR Without Paddles:** Administer CPR manually until professional resuscitation equipment arrives or until definitive treatment can be initiated.
2. **Immediate Medication:** If suspected to have an allergic reaction, administer epinephrine (0.3 mg subcutaneously) if possible. If not available, activate an automated external defibrillator (AED).
3. **IV Fluids and Monitoring:** Begin IV fluids with 5% dextrose at 20 ml/kg/hr to restore blood volume and oxygenation.
4. **CNS Support:** Administer fentanyl 1 mcg subcutaneously for respiratory distress, if indicated.
5. **Oxygen Therapy:** Provide high-flow oxygen (10-20 L/min) via a face mask or nasal cannula.
6. **Monitoring:** Maintain close monitoring of vital signs and responsiveness to ensure effective resuscitation.

### **Follow-up Instructions**  
1. **Immediate Referral:** Secure the patient until professional emergency medical services arrive.
2. **Call for Emergency Services:** Contact 911 immediately if the patient does not respond to CPR or if her condition deteriorates.
3. **Referral to Cardiac Evaluation:** Schedule a follow-up appointment with a cardiologist within 48 hours to evaluate the cause of the cardiac arrest.
