**Clinic or Hospital Location:** Kauniainen

### **Chief Complaint**
The patient is a 46-year-old male who presented to Kauniainen Emergency Department with complaints of acute chest pain (ACP). The pain began approximately 3 hours prior and was described as progressively worsening, radiating to the back. The patient reported no history of significant heart disease or chest discomfort in the past.

### **History of Present Illness (HPI)**
The patient presented with a sudden onset of ACP that started about 3 hours ago. He described it as sharp and increasing in intensity, accompanied by shortness of breath (BSB) and a feeling of tightness in his chest. No prior symptoms were reported. The pain was localized to the left side but worsened when he bent forward. He denied any recent trauma or substance use.

On arrival, the patient appeared visibly distressed, with a rapid heart rate (HR: 120 bpm), tachycardia, and visible signs of exertional angina. He reported no history of diabetes, hypertension, or dyspnea on exertion in the past.

### **Physical Examination Findings**
- **Vital Signs:** Blood pressure (BP): 98/60 mmHg; HR: 120 bpm; RR: 24; temperature: 37°C.
- **Chest Exam:** Auscultation reveals increased effort-related S3 and S1 vibrations bilaterally, with a positive JVD on the left. No evidence of pericardial rub or rales.
- **Airway:** Clear to auscultation bilaterally; no accessory muscles engaged.
- **Lungs:** Clear to auscultation; no wheezing or crackles noted.
- **Extremities:** No visible injuries, but the patient reported localized tenderness at the left chest.

### **Assessment / Diagnosis**
Based on the clinical presentation and physical examination findings, the primary diagnosis considered is **Acute Chest Pain (ACP)**. The patient’s HR and BP suggest a possible underlying cause of vaso-occlusive disease or significant ischemia. The presence of effort-related tachycardia and positive JVD supports a possible coronary artery disease (CAD) or valvular heart disease.

Additional considerations include:
- **Respiratory Distress:** The patient’s BSB may be contributing to his overall distress but does not appear to be life-threatening.
- **Airway Adequacy:** No signs of airway obstruction, and the patient is capable of breathing without assistance.

---

### **Plan / Treatment**
Immediate stabilization is critical. The following measures are planned:
1. **Administer Oxygen:** Room air (20% O2) via nasal cannula to improve oxygenation.
2. **Secure Airway:** No further intervention needed; patient is capable of breathing.
3. **Basic Life Support (BLS):** Patient is not trained, so no CPR will be administered at this time.
4. **Administer Medications:**
   - Beta-blocker (e.g., metoprolol) to reduce heart rate and improve oxygenation.
   - Anticoagulant (e.g., aspirin or low-dose warfarin) if indicated by history or ECG findings.
5. **Electrocardiogram (ECG):** Ordered to assess for arrhythmias or ST-segment changes indicative of CAD.
6. **Transport:** Patient will be transported to Kauniainen General Hospital for further evaluation.

### **Follow-up Instructions**
- **Next Steps:** Follow-up appointment in 24 hours at Kauniainen General Hospital.
- **Diagnostic Tests:** ECG, blood work (including lipid panel and troponin level), and possibly imaging if indicated by ECG findings.
- **Patient Education:** Patient will be advised to monitor symptoms and seek immediate medical attention if they worsen.
