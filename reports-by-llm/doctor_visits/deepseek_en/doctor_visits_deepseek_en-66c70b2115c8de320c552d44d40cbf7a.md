### **Chief Complaint**
The patient is a 42-year-old female who presented with sudden chest pain radiating to her jaw and neck area. She described the pain as sharp and progressively worsening over several minutes. She also reported nausea and sweating, which worsened as the pain intensified.

---

### **History of Present Illness (HPI)**
The patient has a history of hypertension and diabetes, but no prior cardiovascular events. On presentation, she denied recent trauma or substance use. The pain began abruptly about 10 minutes prior to her arrival, initially localized to her left arm but rapidly spreading to her jaw and neck. She reported no significant relief during rest or after attempting to cough.

### **Physical Examination Findings**
Upon arrival, the patient was conscious and alert but appeared slightly cyanotic. Her blood pressure was elevated at 140/90 mmHg, and her heart rate was tachycardic at 100 bpm. She had a visible tenderness in the left arm and neck area, along with mild swelling of the jugular venous distension.

### **Assessment/Diagnosis**
Based on the patient's presentation, elevated blood pressure, chest pain, and tachycardia, the primary diagnosis considered was acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Further imaging guidance is needed to differentiate between STEMI or myocardial infarction versus a pulmonary cause.

---

### **Plan / Treatment**
- **Medications:** Initiate intravenous nitroglycerin 10 mcg/min IV for pain control.
- **Imaging:** Order an ECG and chest X-ray within 30 minutes to assess for coronary artery disease or pulmonary issues.
- **Vital Signs Monitoring:** Maintain close monitoring of blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation.
- **Specialist Consultation:** If imaging confirms a STEMI, refer to the cardiology team. If pulmonary cause is suspected, consider further respiratory evaluation.

If no improvement in symptoms within 5 minutes of treatment, further intervention may be required.

### **Follow-up Instructions**
- The patient should rest at home and monitor her condition closely.
- She should avoid further exertion or stress until advised otherwise.
- Follow up with the cardiology team in 24 hours if symptoms persist or worsen. If no improvement is noted, seek emergency care immediately.
