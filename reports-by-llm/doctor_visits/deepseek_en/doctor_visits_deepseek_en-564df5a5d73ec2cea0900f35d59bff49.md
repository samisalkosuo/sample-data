### **Chief Complaint**
The patient is a 39-year-old female who presented with a "sore throat" as her primary reason for visit.

---

### **History of Present Illness (HPI)**
The patient has reported experiencing a sore throat over the past few days, which became more pronounced overnight. She described it as uncomfortable and noted that she felt unwell during the night, with mild fever and chills. The sore throat began approximately two days ago and started to worsen last night.

### **Physical Examination Findings**
Upon examination, the patient reported a normal temperature (36Â°C). She exhibited a slight erythema around her mouth and throat, consistent with possible inflammation or infection. Her throat appeared mildly inflamed, and she had no other notable symptoms such as cough, headache, or fatigue. No signs of edema or weight loss were observed.

### **Assessment / Diagnosis**
Based on the patient's presentation, the primary diagnosis is likely **pharyngitis**, a common condition characterized by inflammation of the throat. Given her age and absence of significant risk factors (e.g., diabetes, hypertension), no further diagnostic workup was deemed necessary at this time.

### **Plan / Treatment**
The treatment plan includes:
- Prescribing an antibiotic such as Augmentin or Z-Pak to address potential bacterial infection.
- Advising the patient to rest and consume fluids if she has not yet done so.
- Suggesting no major procedures unless symptoms persist beyond a few days.

### **Follow-up Instructions**
The patient is advised to call the clinic in approximately 72 hours (3 days) if her sore throat persists or if she experiences worsening symptoms, such as fever. A follow-up appointment will be scheduled based on her response to treatment and any additional symptoms reported.
