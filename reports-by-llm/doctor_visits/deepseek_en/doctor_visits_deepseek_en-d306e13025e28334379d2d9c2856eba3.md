**History of Present Illness (HPI):** The patient describes experiencing dyspnea on exertion, particularly when climbing stairs. She notes that this symptom started around one week prior to the visit and became more pronounced during activity. She denies other symptoms such as fatigue or chest pain. The patient reports no history of heart disease but mentions a family history of hypertension.

**Physical Examination Findings:** Upon arrival, the patient is in good general health with no palpable ejected edema. Her blood pressure measures 130/85 mmHg, and her pulse rate is 78 bpm. She has normal respiratory rates on both inspirations and expirations. No wheezing or crackles are noted during physical examination.

**Assessment/Diagnosis:** Based on the patient's complaints and physical findings, the primary diagnosis considered is **cardiac dysregulation with preserved ejection fraction (HFrEF)**. This is supported by her hypertension history and the absence of acute respiratory signs.

**Plan / Treatment:** The treatment plan includes:
- Initiation of furosemide 40 mg IV every 8 hours to manage fluid retention.
- Home oxygen therapy at a flow rate of 20 L/min via nasal cannula.
- Follow-up in two weeks for reassessment and adjustment of therapy as needed.
