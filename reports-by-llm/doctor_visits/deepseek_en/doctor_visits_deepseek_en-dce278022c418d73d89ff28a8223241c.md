### **History of Present Illness (HPI)**

### **Physical Examination Findings**
Upon examination, the patient’s vital signs were normal (BP 128/79 mmHg, HR 68 bpm). The extremities appeared free of palpable lesions. The rash was localized to the right arm, approximately two inches in length and one inch in width. It had a dry, itchy consistency and a red undertone. No other notable findings were observed during the physical examination.

### **Assessment / Diagnosis**
Based on the patient’s presentation, the primary diagnosis considered is **dermatomal contact dermatitis** or a mild allergic reaction to the applied cream. The rash is consistent with a dry skin condition that may have been exacerbated by the cream. No evidence of systemic disease was identified during the examination.

### **Plan / Treatment**
The plan includes the following:
1. **Topical Treatment:** Prescription of a corticosteroid ointment (e.g., hydrocortisone 1%) to reduce inflammation and itching.
2. **Moisturizing Lotion:** Application to maintain hydration on the affected area.
3. **Monitoring:** Close observation for improvement or worsening symptoms over the next 48 hours.

No further hospitalization is anticipated, as the condition appears to be self-limiting with no signs of systemic involvement.

### **Follow-up Instructions**
The patient should return to the clinic in approximately one week to reassess the rash. If the rash does not improve or worsens, she should seek medical attention immediately. Additionally, she is advised to monitor for any new symptoms and inform her healthcare provider if they occur.
