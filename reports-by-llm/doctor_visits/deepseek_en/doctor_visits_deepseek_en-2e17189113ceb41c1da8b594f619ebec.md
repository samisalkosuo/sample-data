### **History of Present Illness (HPI)**
The patient reported sudden onset of chest pain located in the left anterior descending territory, radiating to his jaw.

### **Physical Examination Findings**
- **Vital Signs:** Blood pressure: 140/90 mmHg; Heart rate: 82 bpm (regular); Temperature: 36.8째C.
- **Chest Exam:** Auscultation reveals a normal S1 and S2, with a slightly elevated heart sound in the left ventricular area. No murmurs or rubs were heard.
- **Lungs:** Clear to auscultation bilaterally; no wheezing or crackles noted.
- **Abdomen:** Soft, non-tender; no hepatosplenomegaly observed.
- **Extremities:** No edema noted in the legs. Palpitations were present but not rapid or irregular.

### **Assessment / Diagnosis**
Based on the patient's presentation and physical examination findings, the primary diagnosis considered is **acute heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFrEF)**. The symptoms of chest pain, dyspnea, and edema are consistent with this entity. Additionally, the absence of hepatosplenomegaly suggests a low likelihood of chronic kidney disease as the underlying cause.

---

### **Plan / Treatment**
- **Medications:** Initiate with non-invasive measures:
  - **Nitrostat (e.g., amoxicillin/clavulanate):** To manage chest pain and reduce heart workload.
  - **Diuretics (e.g., furosemide):** To address the edema, if persists after initial treatment.
- **IV Fluids:** Consider intravenous fluids to maintain hydration if diuresis is significant.
- **Electrocardiogram (ECG):** Ordered to rule out arrhythmias or other cardiac abnormalities.

---

### **Follow-up Instructions**
The patient should return for follow-up in 7 days. Please bring any worsening symptoms, such as increased chest pain or shortness of breath, along with a complete blood count and kidney function tests. If signs of decompensated heart failure are noted during the follow-up, further treatment may be required.
