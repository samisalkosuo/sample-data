Patient reports severe, uncontrolled breathing difficulty with no oxygen in his face.

**History of Present Illness (HPI):**  
The patient, a 9-year-old male, presented with sudden, unrelenting breathing difficulties. He began experiencing these issues approximately 30 minutes prior to arrival, noting an increasing inability to breathe and progressively lower oxygen levels on face masks. The patient was unresponsive upon arrival, with no signs of distress from others. Paramedics administered CPR and transported the patient to the nearest EMT unit.

**Physical Examination Findings:**  
Upon arrival at the EMT unit, vital signs indicated shock with a blood pressure of 80/50 mmHg and a rapid breathing rate of 40 breaths per minute. The patient was conscious but appeared cyanotic. No other significant findings were noted.

**Assessment/Diagnosis:**  
The patient's sudden breathing difficulties, coupled with unresponsive status and elevated heart rate, led to an immediate assessment of acute cardiac arrest. CPR was administered effectively, restoring circulation.

**Plan/Treatment:**  
Immediate transport to a Level 1 Trauma Center for further evaluation and potential resuscitation. No medications were prescribed; instead, focus was on stabilizing the patient with CPR and securing transport.
