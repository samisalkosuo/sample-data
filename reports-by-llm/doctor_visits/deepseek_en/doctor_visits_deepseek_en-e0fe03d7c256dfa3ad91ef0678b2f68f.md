**Visit Summary Report**

**Visit Date:** 09.06.2025  
**Clinic or Hospital Location:** Savitaipale  

---

### **Chief Complaint**
The patient is a 91-year-old male who presented to the clinic with complaints of increasing back pain over the past two weeks, which has worsened significantly when sitting for more than an hour at a time. The patient also reported experiencing difficulty breathing and shortness of breath, particularly when exerting himself.

---

### **History of Present Illness (HPI)**
The patient has a history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus, both of which are contributing factors to his current symptoms. He mentioned that his back pain started approximately two weeks ago and became more pronounced with prolonged sitting. The pain is localized in the lower back area and radiates to the legs on one side. Additionally, the patient reported difficulty breathing during exertion, which he attributes to his age-related cardiovascular changes.

### **Physical Examination Findings**
The physical examination revealed the following findings:
- **General:** The patient appeared fatigued but otherwise stable.
- **Lung:** No wheezing or crackles were noted. He struggled to breathe deeply and reported difficulty with shortness of breath when exerting himself.
- **Chest:** No signs of cardiovascular compromise were observed, but there was mild edema in the legs consistent with fluid retention from his diabetes and hypertension.
- **Neurological:** The patient exhibited reduced muscle strength on both lower extremities. He had normal reflexes and no evidence of acute neuropathic changes.
- **Genitourinary:** No abnormalities noted during examination.

### **Assessment / Diagnosis**
Based on the patient's chief complaint, history of present illness, physical examination findings, and age-related risk factors:
1. **Degenerative Disc Disease:** The patient's lower back pain is likely secondary to degeneration of soft tissue components in the lumbar spine.
2. **Radicular Pain:** The pain radiating to the legs on one side suggests possible radicular involvement or nerve compression.
3. **Underlying Cardiovascular Changes:** The patient's age and history of hypertension contribute to his current symptoms, particularly his difficulty breathing.

### **Plan / Treatment**
The treatment plan includes the following:
1. **Medications:**
   - **NSAIDs:** prescribed to reduce inflammation (e.g., ibuprofen).
   - **Diuretics:** recommended to manage fluid retention and reduce blood pressure (e.g., furosemide).
   - **Blood Pressure Medications:** review and adjustment of current medications as needed.
2. **Physical Therapy:** Gentle exercises to improve muscle strength and flexibility in the lower extremities, particularly focusing on the legs affected by the back pain.
3. **Follow-Up:** A follow-up appointment with his primary care physician or the attending physician in two weeks to reassess symptoms and treatment response.

---

### **Follow-up Instructions**
- The patient is advised to return for a follow-up visit in two weeks at his next available opportunity.
- He should monitor his symptoms closely, particularly any worsening of back pain or difficulty breathing.
- The patient is encouraged to engage in light activity that does not exacerbate his condition and to avoid prolonged sitting.
