**Visit Summary**

**Visit Date:** 29.12.2023  
**Clinic or Hospital Location:** Jomala

### **Chief Complaint**
The patient is a 64-year-old male who presented with sudden, severe chest pain that started approximately 30 minutes prior to arrival at the clinic. The pain was described as sharp and unrelieved by rest, leading to dizziness and shortness of breath.

---

### **History of Present Illness (HPI)**
The patient reported a sudden onset of chest pain, which began after prolonged physical activity. He stated that the pain worsened with exertion and was accompanied by a racing and irregular heart rate. He also mentioned feeling faint upon arrival at the clinic and experiencing difficulty breathing.

---

### **Physical Examination Findings**
Upon arrival, the patient appeared pale due to lack of oxygenation. His blood pressure was significantly low (90/50 mmHg), and his heart rate was elevated (120 bpm). He exhibited a rapid and weak pulse, with no visible accessory heartbeats. He denied any other symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, or palpitations unrelated to the chest pain.

The airway was clear, but there was minimal effort in breathing, suggesting possible hypoxia. There were no signs of shock on physical examination, but the patient's condition required immediate medical attention.

### **Assessment / Diagnosis**
Based on the patient's presentation and findings, the primary diagnosis considered was a **cardiac arrest** due to sudden chest pain. The airway, breathing, and cardiovascular status necessitated urgent intervention.

Additional diagnostic workup included:
- Blood gas analysis revealing hypoxia (HbO2: 85% normal range).
- Basic metabolic panel showing mild hypotension and possible electrolyte imbalances.
- No evidence of prior medical conditions in the patient's history that would suggest a different cause, such as anaphylaxis or sepsis.

### **Plan / Treatment**
The immediate plan involved:
1. **Immediate CPR:** Administer CPR at the scene if feasible (though not performed due to airway obstruction).
2. **Defibrillator Use:** Administer a single shock with a defibrillator to restore electrical activity in the heart.
3. **Epinephrine Administration:** If signs of anaphylaxis were present, epinephrine would be administered intra-vitaly.
4. **Blood Work:** Conduct further blood tests to assess electrolyte levels and coagulation factors.

### **Follow-up Instructions**
The patient was advised to return within 24 hours for further evaluation and follow-up with the attending physician. He should also undergo a detailed chest X-ray and ECG to rule out any residual cardiac damage or arrhythmias.

Additionally, the patient will be scheduled for an appointment with his primary care physician in the coming week to discuss long-term management of his hypertension and diabetes, as these conditions may predispose him to sudden cardiac events.
