### **Chief Complaint**
The patient is a 3-year-old male who presented with a severe rash that has been spreading rapidly across his body over the past few hours. The rash began in the face and arms, initially appearing as small red bumps, but has now expanded to cover much of the body. He is experiencing intense itching, and the rash is worsening in intensity and size.

### **History of Present Illness (HPI)**
The patient reported that the rash started approximately 3 hours ago when he was exposed to a new substance he recently came into contact with. He described the initial rash as small red bumps on his face and arms, which began to itching immediately. Over time, the rash has spread rapidly across his entire body, including the legs, torso, and extremities. The itching is becoming increasingly intense, and the patient is unable to keep still due to the discomfort caused by the rash.

The patient has no history of allergies or significant pre-existing medical conditions. He is currently free from any other symptoms beyond the rash.

### **Physical Examination Findings**
Upon examination, the patient was conscious and alert but appeared distressed due to the intense itching associated with the rash. His vital signs were unstable, with a tachycardia (fast heart rate) and hypotension (low blood pressure). He is also experiencing difficulty breathing (tachypnea), which is worsening as the rash spreads.

The physical examination revealed a widespread rash affecting all body systems, including the skin, respiratory, cardiovascular, and extremities. The rash is spreading rapidly and appears to be erythema multiforme or a similar reaction.

### **Assessment / Diagnosis**
Based on the patient's presentation, the primary diagnosis considered is **anaphylaxis** due to an unknown allergen exposure. The rash, characterized by rapid spreading and intense itching, aligns with the clinical features of an allergic reaction. However, given the severity of symptoms (tachycardia, hypotension, and respiratory distress), sepsis cannot be entirely ruled out as a potential underlying condition.

Further diagnostic workup, including blood tests to assess for anaphylaxis or sepsis, will be required to confirm the diagnosis and determine the appropriate course of action.

### **Plan / Treatment**
The immediate plan involves stabilizing the patient's vital signs. This includes securing the airway, breathing, and circulation. The following measures are planned:

1. **Immediate Antihistamine Therapy:** To address the rash if it is due to an allergic reaction.
2. **Corticosteroid Therapy:** To reduce inflammation and stabilize the condition in case of sepsis.
3. **Antibiotics:** If a bacterial infection is suspected, though this should be confirmed by lab tests.
4. **Airway Management:** Ensuring clear airways to prevent further respiratory distress.

The patient will also receive intravenous fluids to replace any loss due to hypotension and electrolyte monitoring to ensure the effectiveness of interventions.

### **Follow-up Instructions**
The patient should remain at rest for 24 hours following the visit. He should avoid further exposure to allergens, as this could worsen his condition. If the rash does not improve or worsen within 24 hours, he should contact emergency services immediately.

If confirmed sepsis is present, the patient will be referred to a specialist for further treatment. In case of anaphylaxis, antihistamine therapy and intravenous corticosteroids will continue until symptoms stabilize.
