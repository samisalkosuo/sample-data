**Visit Summary Report**

**Visit Date:** 19th February 2024  
**Clinic Location:** Pietarsaari, Helsinki, Finland  

---

**Chief Complaint:** The patient is a 94-year-old female who presented with complaints of dizziness and difficulty breathing. She described the issue as sudden and worsening when she stood up quickly.

**History of Present Illness (HPI):** The patient has a history of hypertension, diabetes, and chronic respiratory conditions such as COPD and asthma. Her symptoms began approximately two days prior to her visit, starting with mild dizziness that became more pronounced upon standing. She reported difficulty breathing at night, which is exacerbated by lying flat.

**Physical Examination Findings:** Vital signs were within normal ranges for her age group. Blood pressure was slightly elevated due to hypertension (150/95 mmHg). Heart rate and respiratory rate were normal. Blood glucose levels indicated mild diabetes management with occasional hyperglycemia.

**Assessment/Diagnosis:** Based on the patient's symptoms, physical examination, and medical history, it is suspected that she may have orthopnea due to sleep apnea. Given her age and chronic health conditions, sleep apnea is a plausible diagnosis.

**Plan/Treatment:** The treatment plan includes lifestyle modifications such as maintaining an upright position while sleeping (the "catch" position). CPAP therapy will be prescribed to manage breathing difficulties. Additionally, dietary adjustments are recommended to reduce snoring.

**Follow-up Instructions:** The patient should follow up for a sleep study if not already conducted. Blood glucose monitoring is advised to ensure diabetes management. If CPAP therapy proves ineffective or if symptoms worsen, further evaluation by a specialist may be necessary, possibly involving a BiPAP machine.
