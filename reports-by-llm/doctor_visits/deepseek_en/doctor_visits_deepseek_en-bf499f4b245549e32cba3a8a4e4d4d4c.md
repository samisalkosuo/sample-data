### **Chief Complaint**
The patient is a 9-year-old male who presented to the clinic with complaints of swelling around his eyes, which began suddenly after he stopped taking antibiotics for a minor bacterial infection. The patient reported that the swelling worsened and he experienced difficulty breathing.

### **History of Present Illness (HPI)**
The child has a history of mild respiratory infections in the past three years, managed with oral antibiotics.

Upon discontinuation, he experienced localized swelling around both his upper and lower eyelids, which peaked within 15 minutes. He reported no prior exposure to penicillin or other similar medications.

### **Physical Examination Findings**
Upon arrival, the patient appeared slightly pale due to increased breathing. The physical examination revealed mild swelling (2-3 cm) around both the right and left upper eyelids, with no evidence of redness or discoloration beyond this area. No signs of respiratory distress were observed.

### **Assessment / Diagnosis**
The clinical presentation aligns with a penicillin allergy, likely induced by the sudden discontinuation of antibiotics containing penicillin. The mild swelling suggests an allergic reaction rather than a systemic allergic disorder.

### **Plan / Treatment**
- **Immediate Action:** Administer an epinephrine auto-injector (1 mcg) subcutaneously to alleviate symptoms.
- **Monitoring:** Continue observation for 30 minutes post-treatment, noting any worsening signs of swelling or respiratory distress.
- **Follow-up:** Schedule a follow-up appointment with the allergist in 24 hours to confirm the diagnosis and discuss further management.

### **Follow-up Instructions**
1. **EpiPen Administration:** The patient should take an epinephrine auto-injector immediately upon arrival at the follow-up visit.
