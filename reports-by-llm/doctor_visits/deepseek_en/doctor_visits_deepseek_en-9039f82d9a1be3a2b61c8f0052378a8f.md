"C chest pain radiating to the back, accompanied by palpitations since morning."

**History of Present Illness (HPI):**  
The patient is an 83-year-old female presenting with a sudden onset of chest pain. The pain began approximately four hours ago and is described as sharp and constant, radiating towards her back.

**Physical Examination Findings:**  
Upon arrival, the patient is alert and oriented, with no signs of acute distress. Her vital signs indicate a normal heart rate (88 bpm), blood pressure (130/75 mmHg), and temperature (98.6Â°F). She has slight edema in her extremities due to aging and hypertension. Her skin appears turgorously, and she reports no palpitations at this time.

**Assessment/Diagnosis:**  
The patient is being evaluated for acute chest pain, likely angina pectoris or a related condition. Given her age and comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes), the primary diagnosis is considered to be angina pectoris with possible underlying heart disease. The provider notes no immediate life-threatening signs but advises close monitoring.

**Plan/Treatment:**  
- **Medications:** Initiate intravenous nitroprusside 5 mcg/min for blood pressure control, followed by a beta-blocker such as metoprolol 25 mg orally to manage heart rate. IV fluids and electrolytes will be administered if needed.
- **Procedures/Tests:** Consider ECG monitoring in the next 30 minutes if there are signs of arrhythmias.

**Follow-up Instructions:**  
The patient is advised to return for follow-up in 24-48 hours, with a review of symptoms. If any chest pain or palpitations persist, she should return immediately. For primary care follow-up, schedule an appointment within 2-3 weeks.
