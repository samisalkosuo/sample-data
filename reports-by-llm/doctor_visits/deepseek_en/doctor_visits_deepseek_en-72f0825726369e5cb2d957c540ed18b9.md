### **Chief Complaint**
The patient is a 55-year-old female who presents with severe, crushing substernal pain that began suddenly two hours ago. She has known the onset of these symptoms for approximately three months but has not previously sought medical attention due to the gradual nature of her complaints.

---

### **History of Present Illness (HPI)**
The patient describes a sudden onset of severe chest pain radiating to her jaw and neck, described as a squeezing sensation. She states that it started two hours ago and began progressively worse in the last 30 minutes. She denies any shortness of breath or other symptoms at this time but reports a history of asymptomatic chest pain for approximately three months.

On examination, she appears fatigued, with a heart rate of 110 bpm (tachycardic), blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg, and is oriented and alert. She denies any other symptoms or signs of distress.

### **Physical Examination Findings**
Upon physical examination, the patient’s substernal area is tender in several localized areas but does not appear life-threatening at first glance. A thorough cardiovascular exam reveals a regular rate and rhythm, with no murmurs or palpitations beyond those noted on physical examination. Blood pressure remains elevated despite rest.

A routine ECG is performed, revealing an ST-segment elevation pattern suggestive of a STEMI (ST-elevation myocardial infarction). The patient’s blood pressure is elevated at 140/90 mmHg, and she reports no history of hypertension or diabetes. No other significant findings are noted.

---

### **Assessment / Diagnosis**
Based on the physical examination findings and the ECG results, the primary diagnosis is a STEMI (ST-elevation myocardial infarction). The patient’s symptoms are consistent with acute chest pain due to a myocardial infarction, necessitating immediate medical attention. A second opinion has been requested for further evaluation of the STEMI.

### **Plan / Treatment**
The immediate plan includes:
1. **Anticoagulation Therapy:** Initiate intravenous Coumadin ( warfarin) at a dose of 25 mg every 8 hours to prevent thrombosis.
2. **Rest:** Encourage the patient to rest to allow the heart muscle to begin healing.
3. **Follow-up:** Refer to the Cardiology Department for further evaluation and management.

Additional imaging studies, such as an Echocardiogram, may be recommended if there is any uncertainty regarding the STEMI.

---

### **Follow-up Instructions**
The patient should return for follow-up in 24-48 hours if she experiences signs of improvement or worsening symptoms. She is advised to bring her prescribed medications and any recent blood work results. If she experiences chest pain, shortness of breath, or fainting, she should seek immediate medical attention.
