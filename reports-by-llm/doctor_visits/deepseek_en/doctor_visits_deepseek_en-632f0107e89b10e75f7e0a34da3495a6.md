### **Chief Complaint**
The patient is a 20-year-old male who presented with a severe rash on his arms and legs, which began approximately two days prior and has been spreading rapidly. He also reported experiencing itching across his entire body since the onset of the rash.

---

### **History of Present Illness (HPI)**
The patient described the rash as itchy and red, with no prior exposure to known allergens or skin irritants. It started on his arms and legs but has now spread to his face, back, and upper body. He noted that the itching is constant and that his breathing became increasingly difficult, particularly when he moved.

### **Physical Examination Findings**
Upon arrival, the patient appeared distressed with a rapid heart rate and increased breathing due to anxiety related to the spreading rash and his difficulty breathing. The physical examination revealed a rash covering his arms and legs, with no other notable systemic symptoms. The skin turgor was noted in areas of involvement, suggesting possible dehydration.

### **Assessment**
The patient's presentation indicates an emergent situation requiring immediate attention. The primary diagnosis is a likely allergic reaction causing the rash and itching. Secondary possibilities include contact dermatitis or anaphylaxis, but given his age and lack of medical history, the most probable cause is an allergic reaction to an unknown allergen.

### **Plan / Treatment**
1. **Oral Steroids:** Initiate with prednisone 20 mg orally every 4 hours to manage the rash and inflammation.
2. **Antihistamines:** Administer loratadine 5 mg orally once daily as needed for itching.
3. **Monitoring:** Close monitoring of symptoms, including skin turgor and respiratory distress, will be performed throughout the day.
4. **Isolation:** The patient will be secured in a quiet environment to prevent further spreading of the rash and exacerbation of breathing difficulties.

### **Follow-up Instructions**
The patient should return for follow-up in two days for reassessment. If symptoms do not improve or worsen, further evaluation may include a skin prick test to confirm an allergic reaction.
