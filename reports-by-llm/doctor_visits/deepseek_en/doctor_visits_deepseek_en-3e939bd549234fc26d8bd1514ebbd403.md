### **Assessment / Diagnosis**
Based on the patient's presentation, vital signs, and history, the primary diagnosis is **acute chest pain due to an acute myocardial infarction (STEMI) or coronary artery dissection**. The patient is at risk for a potential life-threatening event given the sudden onset of symptoms and her previous unstable angina.

### **Plan / Treatment**
- **Immediate:** Call emergency services (EMS) and start IV fluids to rehydrate and restore electrolyte levels.
- **IV:** Administer nitroglycerin subcutaneously every 5 minutes as tolerated, with a maximum dose of 1 mg/min to control chest pain.
- **Monitoring:** Start an ECG if not already performed. Monitor for signs of arrhythmia or hypotension.
- **Disposition:** If no life-threatening signs emerge within 30 minutes, consider further stabilization at the nearest cardiac care unit.

### **Follow-up Instructions**
The patient is advised to return in 24 hours for further evaluation by a cardiologist. She should bring any recent changes in symptoms or medications and be prepared to discuss her medical history, including previous chest pain episodes.
