- The patient has a history of hypertension and diabetes, which may contribute to the cause or progression of this event.
- No evidence of acute shock or hypovolemia is noted.

### **Plan/Treatment**
Immediate action is required to address the life-threatening situation:

1. **Medical Treatment:**
   - **Antibiotics:** IV amoxicillin-clavulanate (for possible bacterial infection).
   - **Hypertension Management:** Initiate statin therapy to control blood pressure, as this may be related to the cause of the STEMI.
   - **Pain Management:** Administer hydrocodone for pain relief.

2. **Diagnostic Testing:**
   - Repeat ECG in 24 hours to monitor cardiac status.
   - Blood glucose levels will be monitored post-discharge to ensure glycemic control is maintained.

3. **Patient Education:**
   - Advise the patient to avoid further exertion and rest as much as possible until cleared by a healthcare provider.

### **Follow-Up Instructions**
- **Repeat ECG:** In 24 hours, monitor for any signs of STEMI progression or resolution.
