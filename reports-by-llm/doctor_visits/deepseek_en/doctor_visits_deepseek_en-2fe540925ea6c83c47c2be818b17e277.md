**Visit Date:** 07.12.2023  
**Clinic or Hospital Location:** Kärsämäki

### **Chief Complaint**
The patient is a 85-year-old female who reports sudden chest pain, possibly indicative of cardiac arrest.

---

### **History of Present Illness (HPI)**
The patient describes the onset and progression of chest pain as sudden and severe. She states that it began without warning and radiated to her left arm. She denies prior warning signs such as dizziness or fatigue. Her vital signs at presentation include a blood pressure of 150/95 mmHg, a heart rate of 120 bpm, and low oxygen saturation on room air (9% on normal face mask, 4% on high flow nasal cannula). She denies recent trauma, fever, or weight loss. The patient reports no history of heart disease, hypertension, or diabetes at presentation.

---

### **Physical Examination Findings**
The patient’s vital signs are highly unstable, with a rapidly elevated heart rate and tachycardia. Blood pressure is significantly high (150/95 mmHg), suggesting possible shock. She has no edema noted on physical examination. An ECG reveals ST elevation in leads II and III, consistent with a probable myocardial infarction (MI). Blood pressure is low at 80/50 mmHg, indicative of acute hypotension.

---

### **Assessment / Diagnosis**
The primary diagnosis is an acute chest pain event with possible perforation or acute myocardial infarction. Differential diagnoses include LUQ perforation, acute MI, or a massive ascendancy. Given the patient’s age and presentation, immediate intervention is required.

---

### **Plan / Treatment**
- **Vital Signs Monitoring:** Immediate attention to blood pressure (target <140/90 mmHg) and heart rate.
- **Blood Pressure Control:** Initiate appropriate medications, such as ACE inhibitors or ARBs if indicated by ECG findings.
- **Electrocardiogram Monitoring:** Continue monitoring for arrhythmias.
- **Computed Tomography (CT) Scan of the Abdomen:** Order to rule out LUQ perforation and guide potential surgical intervention.

---

### **Follow-up Instructions**
The patient is scheduled for follow-up in 24–48 hours with updated symptoms, vital signs, and ECG findings. If no improvement or worsening occurs, she should return immediately. In the event of severe hypotension (e.g., blood pressure <70 mmHg), she must seek emergency care without delay.
