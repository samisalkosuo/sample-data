### **Chief Complaint**  
The patient is a 68-year-old female who presents with intermittent chest discomfort (chest pain) that started approximately one month ago, following increased stress and sleep deprivation. She describes the pain as exertional in nature but reports it has been worsening over time, particularly when she exercises or sleeps poorly. She also notes a significant weight loss of about 10 pounds over the past three months, accompanied by fatigue and occasional shortness of breath (BSB).

### **History of Present Illness (HPI)**  
The patient describes her chest discomfort as intermittent, typically occurring in the evening after physical activity or stress. She mentions that it is not constant but gets progressively worse with exertion. The pain is described as pressing and radiating to her jaw, though it does not always localize clearly.  

Onset: Approximately one month ago, following increased stress and sleep deprivation.  

Symptoms:  
- Intermittent chest discomfort (chest pain)  
- Weight loss of approximately 10 pounds over the past three months  
- Fatigue as a result of the weight loss  
- Occasional shortness of breath (BSB), particularly during exertion or sleep  
- No history of fever, nausea, or vomiting  

No history of recent trauma, infection, or substance use. She denies any history of chest pain in the past year and does not report any significant changes in her lifestyle recently.

### **Physical Examination Findings**  
The patient is normothermic (36°C) and reports no palpable tenderness or signs of hepatosplenomegaly. Her cardiovascular exam reveals:  
- Blood pressure slightly elevated (~140/90 mmHg), with a pulse rate of 82 bpm, which is within the normal range for her age.  
- Heart rate on auscultation is 78 bpm, with no murmurs or irregularities noted.  
- No edema is visible in the extremities.  

No signs of respiratory distress or fluid retention are present. The patient appears normocytic and normochromic in appearance.

### **Assessment**  
Based on her chief complaint, history of illness, and physical examination findings, the primary diagnosis considered is **stable angina pectoris (coronary artery disease)**. The intermittent chest discomfort, weight loss, fatigue, and shortness of breath are consistent with a chronic condition affecting multiple systems.  

Additional considerations include:  
- Possible underlying hypertension or diabetes, given her weight loss and fatigue.  
- No evidence of acute decompensated heart failure or cardiogenic shock is present.  

Electrocardiogram (EKG) results would be needed to confirm the diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD).

### **Plan**  
The patient will undergo the following diagnostic workup:  
1. **Laboratory Tests:** Comprehensive lipid panel, including total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and fasting glucose levels.  
2. **Electrocardiogram (EKG):** To confirm the diagnosis of coronary artery disease.  
3. **Imaging:** Stress test or echo-cardiogram to assess left ventricular function if CAD is confirmed.  

Medications:  
- **Statins:** To manage cholesterol and reduce risk of angina.  
- **Diuretics:** To address potential fluid retention.  
- **Beta-blockers:** To control chest discomfort and improve exercise tolerance.  
- **Antihypertensive medications:** If blood pressure is elevated.  

Procedures:  
- Stress test or echo-cardiogram to evaluate left ventricular function if CAD is confirmed.

### **Follow-Up Instructions**  
1. The patient should return for follow-up in two weeks for the results of her laboratory tests and imaging studies.  
2. She should take her prescribed medications as directed, including any statins, diuretics, beta-blockers, or antihypertensive medications.  
3. If she experiences chest discomfort, shortness of breath, or fatigue, she should contact her healthcare provider immediately for further evaluation.

This report reflects a comprehensive evaluation and management plan based on the severity level 3 (urgent but stable condition requiring multiple resources). The patient is being managed for potential coronary artery disease with close monitoring to ensure optimal control of her symptoms and underlying conditions.
