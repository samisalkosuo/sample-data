**Chief Complaint:** The patient reported a mild rash on his anterio-lumbar region that appeared approximately two days ago. He described it as tender and red, with no associated symptoms such as itching or fever.

**History of Present Illness (HPI):** The rash began on the left side of his upper back and spread slightly to the right over the past 48 hours. It is painless but slightly erythematous. No other symptoms were reported, including no fever, fatigue, or weight loss.

**Physical Examination Findings:** Upon examination, the patient's anterio-lumbar region showed a tender, red rash that was evenly distributed without any scaling or exudate. No other notable findings were observed during the physical check.

**Assessment/Diagnosis:** Based on the clinical presentation and examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is erythema multiforme (EMA), a mild skin condition characterized by an itchy, red rash that can appear anywhere on the body.

**Plan/Treatment:** 
- **Topical Treatment:** Apply a mild, non-irritating topical antihistamine cream to the affected area twice daily.
- **Sun Protection:** Avoid direct sun exposure for at least 30 minutes after applying broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher.
- **Reassurance:** Provide reassurance regarding the minor nature of the condition and its self-limiting qualities.

**Follow-up Instructions:** The patient should monitor the rash for any worsening symptoms. A follow-up consultation is recommended in 2 to 3 days if no significant changes are observed, preferably by phone or video call.
