### **Physical Examination Findings**  
Upon arrival, the patient appeared normothermic (36.8Â°C) and in good general condition. His heart rate was 78 bpm, slightly elevated due to exertion from his abdomen pain. No tachycardia or signs of distress were observed.  

The physical examination revealed:  
- Mild tenderness localized to the left upper quadrant abdomen.  
- A palpable, hard mass in the right upper quadrant abdomen (1 cm in diameter).  
- No evidence of hepatosplenomegaly.  
- Normal liver enzymes (ALT/AST: 35 U/L each).  
- No signs of jaundice or ascites.  

The patient reported no history of fever, weight loss, or other systemic symptoms.

### **Assessment/Diagnosis**  
Based on the patient's chief complaint and physical examination findings, the primary diagnosis considered is **functional dyspepsia (FD)** with a possible underlying cause such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).  

Additional considerations included:  
- The presence of a palpable abdominal mass in the right upper quadrant.  
- The absence of hepatosplenomegaly or other signs of chronic hepatitis.  
- The lack of evidence for an acute medical emergency, given the severity level and the availability of one resource (e.g., blood tests).

No secondary diagnoses were identified at this time.

### **Plan/Treatment**  
The patient will be managed with reassurance and dietary modification to address symptoms related to functional dyspepsia. Specifically:  

1. **Dietary Recommendations:**  
   - Avoid fatty or spicy foods, particularly those high in fat content (e.g., fried foods).  
   - Increase intake of anti-acid medications if necessary.  

2. **Monitoring:**  
   - Blood tests will be conducted to monitor liver enzymes and rule out any underlying conditions.  

3. **Follow-Up:**  
   - The patient is scheduled for a follow-up in 1 week to reassess symptoms and review dietary changes.

### **Follow-Up Instructions**  
- Avoid consuming fatty or spicy foods, particularly those high in fat content (e.g., fried foods).  
- Monitor for any worsening of the abdomen pain or nausea.  
- Await results from the blood tests before making further dietary adjustments.  
- Return to the clinic within 1 week if symptoms persist or worsen.
