### **Chief Complaint**
The patient is a 75-year-old female who presented to the emergency department with complaints of chest pain and shortness of breath for approximately two hours following a meal. She reported that her symptoms worsened after consuming fatty food.

---

### **History of Present Illness (HPI)**
The patient described experiencing mild chest discomfort, rated on the scale from 1 to 10, which she estimated at an 8/10 due to its onset and intensity. The pain was localized to the left side of her heart and radiated towards her shoulder. She stated that it started five minutes prior to eating a fatty meal, which she believes may have triggered it. She also reported feeling slightly out of breath during exertion but did not experience any other symptoms such as nausea, dizziness, or palpitations.

### **Physical Examination Findings**
Upon arrival, the patient appeared slightly pale and had increased heart rate (108 bpm) and blood pressure (135/90 mmHg). She reported no history of chest pain in the past 6 months. The physical examination revealed mild edema in her legs but no signs of respiratory distress or cyanosis. No other notable findings were observed.

### **Assessment / Diagnosis**
Based on the patient's presentation, the primary diagnosis considered was **angina pectoris** due to suspected coronary artery disease (CAD). However, given the severity and duration of her symptoms, further investigation into a potential acute cardiac event is warranted. No acute life-threatening signs were identified at this time.

### **Plan / Treatment**
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Administer oxygen via nasal cannula at 4 L/min to ensure adequate ventilation.
   - Secure the patient in a comfortable position and monitor vital signs closely.
   - Provide reassurance and reassess her symptoms if they worsen.

2. **Medical Evaluation:**
   - Order an Echocardiogram to assess left ventricular function and identify any structural abnormalities.
   - Conduct a stress test (e.g., ST-segment shift) to evaluate ischemic changes in the heart.
   - Consider a 12-lead ECG to rule out inferior wall myocardial infarction.

3. **Plan for Follow-Up:**
   - Schedule a follow-up appointment in 48 hours to reassess symptoms and review test results.
   - If no acute event is identified, monitor her condition and consider discontinuing the fatty meal if it was a precipitating factor.

---

### **Follow-up Instructions**
- The patient should return for follow-up in approximately 48 hours. During this time, she should avoid further exertion or consumption of fatty foods.
- If symptoms persist or worsen, she should return to the emergency department immediately.
- Follow all instructions from her healthcare provider regarding medication and monitoring.
