**Date:** 20.08.2024  
**Clinic Location:** Pukkila, Finland

### **Chief Complaint**  
The patient is a 96-year-old female who presented with a mild rash on her face and neck. The rash began approximately two weeks prior to the visit and has been progressively worsening in intensity. She described it as erythema, scaling, and itching, which she attributes to increased sun exposure during her daily activities.

---

### **History of Present Illness (HPI)**  
The patient reported a localized skin reaction that started two weeks ago. Initially, she noticed mild itching on her face and neck after spending time outdoors. Over the following days, the rash became more noticeable, particularly when she engaged in physical activity or faced direct sunlight. She has no history of similar skin reactions in the past. The patient noted that she avoids prolonged sun exposure due to her advanced age and reports no other symptoms at this time.

### **Physical Examination Findings**  
Upon examination, the patient’s vital signs were within normal limits (BP: 128/79 mmHg; HR: 68 bpm). The skin on her face and neck was mildly erythematous with scattered scaling. No palpable lymph nodes or other systemic symptoms were identified. There was no evidence of edema, fatigue, or other signs of systemic distress.

### **Assessment / Diagnosis**  
Based on the patient’s presentation, a likely diagnosis of a mild allergic reaction (likely toluene hypersensitivity) is considered. The rash aligns with typical characteristics of an allergic skin reaction, particularly in an individual with a history of sun sensitivity and atopic dermatitis. No other abnormalities were noted during the examination.

### **Plan / Treatment**  
1. **Medications:** Over-the-counter antihistamine medication (e.g., loratadine or cetirizine) to alleviate itching and reduce the severity of the rash.  
2. **Procedures/Recommendations:** No further diagnostic testing is necessary at this time. Monitor the condition over the next few days with reassurance from the healthcare provider.  
3. **Follow-up:** A follow-up visit in approximately two weeks to assess the resolution of the rash and ensure no progression.

### **Follow-up Instructions**  
- Follow up in 2 weeks for reassessment if the rash has not cleared or shows signs of worsening.
- Avoid prolonged sun exposure as it may exacerbate the condition.
- Discontinue any potential irritants, such as perfumes or scented products, to prevent further reactions.
