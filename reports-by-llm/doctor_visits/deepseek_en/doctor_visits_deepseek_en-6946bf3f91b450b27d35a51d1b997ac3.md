### **Plan / Treatment**
1. **Medications:** Initiate monitoring of blood glucose levels with Metformin 500 mg twice daily for type 2 diabetes management.
2. **Procedures/Recommendations:**
   - Start with a low-dose nitroprusside (e.g., 6 mcg) to assess left ventricular function without causing significant stress on her heart.
   - If nitroprusside response is inconclusive, consider a stress test or Echocardiogram to evaluate cardiac function and rule out any underlying cardiovascular issues.
