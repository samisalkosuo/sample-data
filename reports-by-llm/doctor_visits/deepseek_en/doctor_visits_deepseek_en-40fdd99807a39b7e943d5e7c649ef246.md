### **Chief Complaint**
The patient is a 100-year-old female who presents with sudden onset of severe shortness of breath, accompanied by chest discomfort and fatigue for the past several hours. She states that her symptoms worsened significantly over the last 30 minutes.

---

### **History of Present Illness (HPI)**
The patient describes experiencing mild fatigue for approximately two hours prior to her presentation. This was followed by a sudden onset of severe shortness of breath, which she experienced even at rest. She mentions that the chest discomfort started about three days ago but did not initially appear severe. She denies any recent trauma or illness and reports no history of heart disease.

### **Physical Examination Findings**
Upon arrival, the patient is conscious and alert but appears significantly decompensated. Her systemic presentation includes:  
- Rapid heart rate (120 bpm) with regular rhythm.  
- Tachycardia (140 bpm).  
- Cyanotic绀绀紫 due to acute decompensated heart failure.  
- Mildly elevated temperature (38°C).  
- Slightly increased respiratory rate (30 breaths per minute).  
- No edema noted on physical examination.  

Vital signs at presentation:  
- Blood pressure: 90/60 mmHg (pre-hypertensive).  
- Heart rate: 120 bpm.  
- Respiratory rate: 30 breaths per minute.  
- SpO2: 98% on room air.

### **Assessment / Diagnosis**
The patient is presenting with acute decompensated heart failure, likely secondary to pulmonary congestion and shock. She has no history of prior heart disease or significant comorbidities. The clinical picture suggests a need for immediate interventions.

---

### **Plan / Treatment**
- **Immediate Interventions:**  
  - Intravenous fluids to raise blood pressure (1000 mL over 4 hours).  
  - Oxygen therapy with non-invasive mechanical ventilation at 20 L/min, as her SpO2 remains normoxic.  

- **Medical Management:**  
  - Anticoagulation therapy if there is a risk of clotting (e.g., warfarin or abciximab).  
  - Administration of short course epinephrine (1 mcg) to treat any potential severe allergic reaction or acute hypotensive crisis.  

- **Pharmacological Therapy:**  
  - Long-acting beta-blocker (e.g., metoprolol) to manage tachycardia and reduce pulmonary congestion.  
  - ACE inhibitor if contraindicated, based on patient preference.

### **Follow-up Instructions**
The patient should remain in the hospital for continued monitoring until her condition stabilizes. She is advised to avoid any fluid intake unless prescribed by her attending physician. She must return for follow-up within 24-48 hours or as directed by her doctor.
