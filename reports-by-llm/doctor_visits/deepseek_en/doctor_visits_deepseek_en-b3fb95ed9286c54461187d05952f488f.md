### **Assessment / Diagnosis**
The patient's presentation indicates an acute medical emergency requiring immediate attention. The clinical findings suggest a potential cardiac arrest due to the sudden onset of chest pain and associated respiratory distress. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause, which could involve conditions such as unexplained hypertension, arrhythmias, or other cardiovascular issues.

### **Plan / Treatment**
Immediate CPR (Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation) will be administered by the medical team. ECC (Electrical Cardioversion) may follow if CPR is ineffective. Blood work will be conducted to identify potential causes of the episode, such as cardiac arrhythmias or electrolyte imbalances. Further treatment options will depend on the results of these tests.

### **Follow-up Instructions**
The patient should remain in a quiet and supportive environment post-emergency until stabilized. She should monitor her vital signs closely for any signs of distress. If she is unable to be transported immediately, she should stay at the hospital under close medical supervision.
