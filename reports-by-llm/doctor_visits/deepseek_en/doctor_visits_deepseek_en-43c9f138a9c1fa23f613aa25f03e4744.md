**Chief Complaint:** Mild Rash on Arms and Legs  

The patient is a 13-year-old female who presented with a mild rash located on her arms and legs. The rash began approximately two weeks prior, starting as a small red spot that gradually expanded outward. She described it as itchy and uncomfortable to touch, particularly in warmer weather.

---

**History of Present Illness (HPI):**  
The patient reported no significant history of skin conditions or exposure to any products. The rash appeared symmetrical on both arms and legs without any asymmetry. There were no other symptoms reported, such as fever, itching elsewhere, or systemic signs of infection.

---

**Physical Examination Findings:**  
Upon examination, the skin was smooth with no visible ulcers or open sores. The rash itself was slightly red or warm to the touch. No edema, jaundice, or other systemic symptoms were present. The patient reported no exposure to any skincare products beyond what she typically uses.

---

**Assessment/Diagnosis:**  
The primary diagnosis is considered a mild skin reaction, likely due to contact dermatitis from her skincare products. This is speculative and based on the presented symptoms without an underlying condition like eczema or contact allergen exposure.

**Plan/Treatment:**  
Monitor for improvement with reassurance. No immediate medications are required unless indicated by follow-up findings. Follow-up will involve monitoring the rash's progression and scheduling a revisit in two weeks to assess its resolution.

---

**Follow-up Instructions:**  
The patient is advised to avoid further exposure to her skincare products until the follow-up visit. She should wear protective clothing when handling similar products. A follow-up appointment is scheduled for 14 days, with reassurance of skin health and monitoring any changes in the rash's appearance or severity.
