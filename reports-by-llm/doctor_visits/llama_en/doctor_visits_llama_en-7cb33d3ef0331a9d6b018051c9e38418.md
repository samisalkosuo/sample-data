**Visit Summary**

**Date:** 29.06.2024
**Location:** Kumlinge Clinic
**Severity Level:** 3 (Urgent)

**Patient Information:**
- **Gender:** Male
- **Age:** 76 years

**Chief Complaint:**
The patient presented with complaints of progressive difficulty breathing, particularly during exertion, and a feeling of general malaise.

**History of Present Illness (HPI):**
The patient reported that his symptoms began approximately two weeks ago. Initially, he experienced mild shortness of breath after walking more than 100 meters without resting. Over time, the symptoms have worsened, with the patient now needing to rest after even minor exertion. He also reports a decrease in his usual appetite and an increase in fatigue.

**Physical Examination Findings:**
Given the severity level of this case (3), the physical examination was conducted with caution to avoid exacerbating any potential respiratory compromise. The patient appeared anxious but cooperative, with vital signs showing:

- **Temperature:** 37.5Â°C
- **Blood Pressure:** 160/90 mmHg
- **Heart Rate:** 110 beats per minute
- **Respiratory Rate:** 24 breaths per minute
- **Oxygen Saturation (SpO2):** 92% on room air

The patient's lungs were clear to auscultation, and there was no evidence of consolidation or wheezing. The chest was slightly enlarged due to the patient's increased respiratory effort.

**Assessment / Diagnosis:**
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation is suspected. This condition is consistent with the patient's history of progressive shortness of breath over time, particularly during exertion, along with decreased appetite and fatigue.

**Plan / Treatment:**
The patient was prescribed:

- **Inhaled Corticosteroids:** 500 mcg via metered-dose inhaler (MDI) twice daily for 2 weeks.
- **Bronchodilator:** Albuterol sulfate 2 puffs via MDI as needed for symptoms.
- **Antibiotics:** Amoxicillin-clavulanate 500 mg orally twice daily for 7 days, pending culture results.

The patient was also advised to increase fluid intake and avoid smoking. A follow-up appointment is scheduled for 1 week from the date of this visit to assess the effectiveness of treatment and adjust as necessary.

**Follow-up Instructions:**
- The patient should return to the clinic in one week for a follow-up appointment.
- If symptoms worsen or do not improve with treatment, contact the healthcare provider immediately.
- The patient is advised to continue taking prescribed medications as directed and to report any changes in symptoms to the healthcare provider.

**Additional Notes:** Due to the severity of this case (3), it was deemed necessary to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust treatment accordingly.
