**Date:** May 9, 2023
**Location:** Pello Clinic
**Severity Level:** 3 (Urgent)

**Patient Information:**
- **Gender:** Male
- **Age:** 98 years old

**Chief Complaint:**
The patient presented with complaints of worsening shortness of breath and fatigue over the past week, which have significantly impacted his daily activities.

**History of Present Illness (HPI):**
Mr. [Last Name] reported that he has been experiencing progressive dyspnea (shortness of breath) and generalized fatigue, particularly in the morning. These symptoms worsened over the past week, with an increase in frequency and severity. He also mentioned a recent episode of orthopnea (difficulty breathing while lying down), which he described as feeling like he is drowning. The patient has no history of similar episodes and has been relatively healthy until this point.

**Physical Examination Findings:**
Given Mr. [Last Name]'s age and the severity of his symptoms, a thorough physical examination was conducted to assess for any underlying causes. Vital signs were within normal limits, but oxygen saturation levels were slightly decreased (92% on room air). The patient's respiratory rate was elevated at 24 breaths per minute. A chest X-ray was ordered to evaluate for any pulmonary complications.

**Assessment / Diagnosis:**
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with possible pneumonia is suspected. The patient's age and comorbidities also raise concerns for potential complications such as respiratory failure or cardiac issues.

**Plan / Treatment:**
- **Medications:** The patient was started on oxygen therapy via nasal cannula, with the goal of maintaining an oxygen saturation level above 90%. He will be prescribed a short-course inhalation therapy (SCT) regimen consisting of bronchodilators and corticosteroids to manage his COPD symptoms. Antibiotics were also ordered based on the chest X-ray findings.
- **Procedures:** A pulmonary function test (PFT) was conducted to assess Mr. [Last Name]'s lung function, which revealed significant impairment consistent with his diagnosis of COPD.

**Follow-up Instructions:**
The patient is scheduled for a follow-up appointment in 2 weeks to reassess his condition and adjust his treatment plan as needed. He will also be contacted by the respiratory therapy department to discuss oxygen therapy management and provide education on proper use of inhalers.
