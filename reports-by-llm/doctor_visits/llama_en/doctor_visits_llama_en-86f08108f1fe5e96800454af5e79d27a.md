**Visit Summary**

**Date:** January 29, 2024
**Location:** Pielavesi Clinic
**Patient Information:**
- **Gender:** Male
- **Age:** 104 years

**Chief Complaint:**
The patient presented with complaints of progressive shortness of breath and fatigue over the past week.

**History of Present Illness (HPI):**
The patient reported that his shortness of breath worsened over time, making it increasingly difficult to perform daily activities. He also experienced generalized fatigue, which affected his appetite and sleep patterns. The patient denied any chest pain or coughing up blood. His oxygen saturation levels were consistently below 90% on room air.

**Physical Examination Findings:**
Given the patient's age and severity level (1), a thorough physical examination was conducted with caution to avoid exacerbating any potential respiratory compromise. Vital signs revealed a heart rate of 120 bpm, blood pressure of 180/80 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 82% on room air. The patient appeared pale and had difficulty speaking in full sentences due to shortness of breath.

**Assessment / Diagnosis:**
The patient's presentation is consistent with acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF), given the progressive nature of his symptoms and low oxygen saturation levels. Further diagnostic testing, including an echocardiogram and blood work, was ordered to confirm this diagnosis.

**Plan / Treatment:**
- **Medications:** The patient was started on furosemide 40 mg IV every 6 hours as needed for fluid overload and metoprolol succinate 50 mg orally twice daily for heart rate control.
- **Oxygen Therapy:** Continuous oxygen therapy via nasal cannula at 4 liters per minute was initiated to improve oxygen saturation levels.
- **Monitoring:** The patient will be closely monitored for signs of worsening heart failure, including increased shortness of breath, fatigue, and decreased urine output.

**Follow-up Instructions:**
The patient is scheduled for a follow-up appointment in two weeks. In the meantime, he should continue to take his medications as prescribed and report any changes in symptoms or condition to the clinic immediately.
