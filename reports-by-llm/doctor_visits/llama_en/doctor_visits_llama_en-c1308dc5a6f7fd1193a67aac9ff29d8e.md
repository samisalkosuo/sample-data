**Visit Summary**

**Date:** 19.03.2024
**Location:** Kuhmoinen Clinic

**Patient Information:**
- **Gender:** Female
- **Age:** 33 years old

**Chief Complaint:**
The patient presented with a complaint of worsening right lower quadrant abdominal pain, accompanied by nausea and vomiting.

**History of Present Illness (HPI):**
The patient reported that her symptoms began approximately 2 days ago, initially presenting as mild discomfort. Over the past 24 hours, the pain has intensified, becoming more severe and radiating to her back. She also experiences nausea and vomiting, which have worsened over time. The patient denied any recent travel or exposure to infectious agents.

**Physical Examination Findings:**
Given the severity level of 4, the physical examination was focused on assessing for signs of peritonitis, dehydration, and potential bowel obstruction. The patient presented with tenderness in the right lower quadrant, guarding (muscle tension), and rebound tenderness. Her vital signs were stable, but she appeared dehydrated. No significant abdominal masses or distension were noted.

**Assessment / Diagnosis:**
Based on the clinical presentation, a diagnosis of acute appendicitis was made. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with this diagnosis.

**Plan / Treatment:**
The patient will be admitted for observation and treatment. She will receive broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover potential bacterial infections and undergo imaging studies (CT scan) to confirm the diagnosis and assess for any complications such as bowel obstruction or perforation. The patient will also be managed with intravenous fluids to address dehydration.

**Follow-up Instructions:**
The patient is scheduled for follow-up in 24 hours to reassess her condition and remove the appendix via surgical intervention if necessary. She should return to the clinic at that time, prepared for possible surgery. In the meantime, she should continue to manage her symptoms with over-the-counter pain medication as directed by her healthcare provider.

**Additional Notes:**
The patient's age and overall health status make this a relatively straightforward case. However, given the severity of her symptoms, close monitoring is necessary to ensure that any complications arise promptly.
