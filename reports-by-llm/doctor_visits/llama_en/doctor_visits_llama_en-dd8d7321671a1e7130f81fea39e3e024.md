### Chief Complaint

The patient presented with a complaint of progressive difficulty breathing over the past two weeks, exacerbated by exertion. She reported feeling short of breath even at rest and experiencing occasional coughing fits.

---

### History of Present Illness (HPI)

The patient's symptoms began approximately three weeks ago, worsening gradually over time. Initially, she attributed her symptoms to a cold but soon realized that the difficulty breathing persisted despite rest and hydration. The patient has no significant past medical history relevant to her current condition. She is a non-smoker and has never been a heavy drinker.

The patient's family reported that her oxygen saturation levels have decreased significantly over the past week, prompting them to seek immediate medical attention. They observed her using supplemental oxygen at home but noted an increase in shortness of breath during exertion.

### Physical Examination Findings

Given the severity level and patient profile, a thorough physical examination was conducted with emphasis on respiratory function. The patient's vital signs were as follows:
- **Temperature:** 37.5°C
- **Blood Pressure:** 140/80 mmHg
- **Heart Rate:** 110 bpm
- **Oxygen Saturation (SpO2):** 92% on room air

The physical examination revealed no acute distress or abnormalities in the lungs, heart, or other organs. However, auscultation of the lungs showed bilateral wheezes consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation.

### Assessment / Diagnosis

Based on the patient's history and physical findings, a diagnosis of COPD exacerbation was made. The patient is at risk for respiratory failure due to her decreased oxygen saturation levels and symptoms suggestive of acute bronchospasm.

**Additional Considerations:**
- **Potential Complications:** Respiratory failure, acute heart failure.
- **Underlying Conditions:** COPD, asthma (history not provided).

---

### Plan / Treatment

The patient was admitted for close monitoring and treatment to manage her exacerbation. The following interventions were initiated:
- **Oxygen Therapy:** Supplemental oxygen at 4 liters per minute via nasal cannula.
- **Bronchodilators:** Albuterol administered via nebulizer, with a plan for repeated doses as needed.
- **Corticosteroids:** Prednisone 40 mg daily to reduce inflammation and prevent further exacerbation.
- **Monitoring:** Continuous pulse oximetry and frequent vital sign checks.

### Follow-up Instructions

The patient is scheduled for follow-up in the clinic on April 3, 2024. She will be assessed for improvement or worsening of symptoms and adjusted accordingly. The family was advised to continue oxygen therapy at home if her condition does not improve within a few days. They were also instructed to seek immediate medical attention if she experiences any increase in shortness of breath, chest pain, or fever.

**Discharge Instructions:**
- **Medications:** Continue as prescribed.
- **Follow-up:** Schedule for April 3, 2024.
