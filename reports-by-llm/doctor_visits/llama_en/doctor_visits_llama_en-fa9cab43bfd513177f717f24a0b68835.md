Patient Information:
Male, 63 years old

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with complaints of progressive difficulty breathing and a persistent cough, which worsened over the past week.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient reported that he has been experiencing increasing shortness of breath, particularly during physical exertion. He also mentioned a persistent cough that produces yellowish sputum. The symptoms started approximately 7 days ago and have gradually worsened. The patient denied any recent travel or exposure to potential allergens.

Physical Examination Findings:
Given the severity level of 2 (Emergent – potential life threat), the physical examination was focused on assessing respiratory function and identifying potential causes for the patient's symptoms. Vital signs revealed a temperature of 38.5°C, blood pressure 140/90 mmHg, pulse 110 bpm, and oxygen saturation 92% on room air. The patient exhibited signs of respiratory distress, including increased work of breathing and bilateral wheezes. Lung sounds were clear bilaterally, but there was an increase in lung markings consistent with bronchitis.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of acute bronchitis was made. The patient's age and underlying health status also contributed to the severity of his condition.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient was prescribed a 7-day course of azithromycin (1g daily) for suspected community-acquired pneumonia. He was also advised to use an inhaler containing salbutamol as needed for bronchospasm relief. The patient was instructed to rest and avoid strenuous activities until his symptoms improved.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient is scheduled for a follow-up appointment in 2 weeks to reassess his condition and adjust the treatment plan if necessary. He should contact the clinic immediately if his symptoms worsen or if he experiences any concerning signs, such as chest pain or difficulty breathing.

Note: The patient's condition was closely monitored during the visit, and his oxygen saturation levels were regularly checked to ensure that they remained stable.
