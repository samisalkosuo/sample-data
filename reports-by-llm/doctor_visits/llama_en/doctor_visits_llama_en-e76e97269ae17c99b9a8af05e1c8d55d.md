**Visit Summary**

**Date:** 29.07.2025
**Location:** Kihni√∂ Clinic
**Severity Level:** 4

**Patient Information:**
- **Gender:** Male
- **Age:** 41 years old

**Chief Complaint:**
The patient presented with a complaint of progressive left-sided chest pain radiating to the back, accompanied by shortness of breath and fatigue over the past two weeks.

**History of Present Illness (HPI):**
The patient reported that the symptoms started approximately three weeks ago. Initially, he experienced mild discomfort while engaging in physical activities but gradually worsened over time. The pain is described as a dull ache, worsening with deep breathing and movement. He also reports experiencing occasional coughing fits, which seem to be triggered by exertion. The patient has noticed an increase in fatigue, particularly during the morning hours.

**Physical Examination Findings:**
Given the severity level of 4, the physical examination was conducted with caution to avoid exacerbating the condition. Vital signs were within normal limits. The patient's oxygen saturation was 98% on room air. The chest was examined for any abnormalities; a dull ache was noted in the left lower quadrant, and there was no evidence of respiratory distress. The lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.

**Assessment / Diagnosis:**
Based on the history and physical examination findings, the patient is suspected to have a possible pulmonary embolism (PE) given the nature of his symptoms and the severity level of 4. Further diagnostic testing, including an echocardiogram and possibly a CT pulmonary angiography, will be necessary for confirmation.

**Plan / Treatment:**
The patient was started on anticoagulation therapy with apixaban 2 mg twice daily to reduce the risk of further clot formation. He is also prescribed aspirin 81 mg once daily for its antiplatelet effects. The patient is advised to remain ambulatory and avoid heavy lifting or strenuous activities until further notice.

**Follow-up Instructions:**
The patient will be scheduled for follow-up in two weeks to assess the efficacy of anticoagulation therapy and monitor for any signs of improvement or deterioration. In the meantime, he should report any worsening symptoms immediately to his primary care physician.
