Visit Summary:

Date: March 10, 2024
Location: Juupajoki Clinic

Patient Information:
Male patient, age 26

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with complaints of worsening back pain and fatigue over the past few weeks.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient reported a gradual increase in back pain, particularly in the lower lumbar region, which started approximately 6 weeks ago. The pain is described as a dull ache that worsens with movement and improves with rest. Additionally, the patient has been experiencing fatigue, which is more pronounced on mornings and after periods of physical activity. There have been no recent trauma or significant changes in lifestyle that could contribute to these symptoms.

Physical Examination Findings:
Given the severity level of 4, the patient's presentation warrants a thorough examination. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg and a pulse rate of 70 beats per minute. The patient's temperature is 37°C (98.6°F). On physical examination, there is tenderness in the lower lumbar region, but no significant muscle spasms or neurological deficits. The patient's gait is slightly altered due to pain.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of chronic low back pain with associated fatigue is considered. Further evaluation may include imaging studies (e.g., MRI) to rule out underlying structural causes such as disc herniation or spinal stenosis.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient will be prescribed a multimodal approach to manage their symptoms:

* Acetaminophen 500mg three times daily for pain management
* Ibuprofen 200mg twice daily for anti-inflammatory effects
* Muscle relaxants (cyclobenzaprine) as needed for muscle spasms
* Physical therapy referral to address posture, strengthening, and flexibility exercises

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient is advised to follow up in two weeks for a re-evaluation of their symptoms. In the meantime, they are encouraged to maintain a consistent exercise routine, avoid heavy lifting, and use proper body mechanics when performing daily activities.

Note: The severity level of 4 indicates that the patient's condition requires careful monitoring and management to prevent further deterioration.
