**Chief Complaint:**
The patient presented with a 2-day history of worsening abdominal pain, accompanied by nausea and vomiting. He reported that the pain is more pronounced after meals and has increased in severity over the past 24 hours.

**History of Present Illness (HPI):**
The patient's symptoms began on Wednesday evening, with mild cramping and discomfort. Initially, he managed his symptoms with over-the-counter antacids and rest. However, the pain worsened significantly overnight, leading to vomiting and dehydration. He has not been able to keep fluids down and is experiencing significant distress.

A diagnostic imaging study (CT scan) of the abdomen is planned for the following day to confirm the diagnosis and assess for any complications. The patient's parents have been informed, and they are advised to monitor their child's condition closely.
