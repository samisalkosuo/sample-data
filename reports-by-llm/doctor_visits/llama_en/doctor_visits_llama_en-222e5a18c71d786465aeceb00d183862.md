Visit Summary:

Date: May 6, 2025
Location: Utsjoki Clinic

Patient Information:
Male, 64 years old

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with complaints of progressive shortness of breath and fatigue over the past few weeks.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient reported that his symptoms began approximately 4-6 weeks ago, worsening gradually over time. He described feeling winded even when performing light activities such as walking or gardening. The patient also mentioned experiencing occasional chest discomfort, which he attributes to angina. Notably, the patient's oxygen saturation levels have been consistently below 90% on room air, indicating a significant impairment in his respiratory function.

Physical Examination Findings:
Given the severity of the patient's symptoms and his age, a thorough physical examination was performed to assess for any underlying conditions contributing to his shortness of breath. The patient exhibited signs of congestive heart failure (CHF), including bilateral rales and jugular venous distension. His oxygen saturation levels remained below 90% on room air, further supporting the presence of CHF.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
Based on the patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, and laboratory results (not provided), a diagnosis of congestive heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) was made. The patient's low oxygen saturation levels and signs of CHF suggest that he is at risk for significant morbidity and mortality if not properly managed.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient will be started on 25 mg of spironolactone daily to manage fluid overload and reduce symptoms of CHF. He will also receive 500 mg of lisinopril twice daily to reduce blood pressure and alleviate strain on the heart. The patient will be advised to maintain a low-sodium diet, increase his fluid intake, and avoid strenuous activities until further notice.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient is scheduled for follow-up in one week to reassess his symptoms and adjust his treatment plan as needed. He should contact the clinic immediately if he experiences any worsening of his symptoms or if he requires assistance with breathing.

Severity Level: 2

Note: The severity level of 2 indicates that the patient's condition poses a potential life threat, but immediate resuscitation is not required.
