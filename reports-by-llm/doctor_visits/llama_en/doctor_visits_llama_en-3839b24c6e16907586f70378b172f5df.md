Location: Hämeenlinna Clinic

Patient Information:
Gender: Male
Age: 3 years

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with a 2-day history of fever, cough, and difficulty breathing.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient's parents reported that their child had been playing outside in the cold weather when he started to feel unwell. He developed a high fever, which was accompanied by a persistent cough and shortness of breath. The symptoms worsened over the past 24 hours, with the child becoming increasingly irritable and refusing to drink fluids.

Physical Examination Findings:
Given the patient's age and severity level (3), the physical examination revealed signs of respiratory distress, including bilateral wheezes and decreased lung sounds. The patient's oxygen saturation was 92% on room air, indicating mild hypoxemia. The child's temperature was 39°C, confirming the presence of a fever.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
Based on the clinical presentation, the patient is diagnosed with viral acute bronchiolitis, a common lower respiratory tract infection in young children. The high fever and cough are consistent with this diagnosis, while the shortness of breath and wheezes suggest some degree of airway obstruction.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient will be started on acetaminophen (Tylenol) 4 mg/kg every 4 hours as needed for fever reduction. A course of azithromycin 10 mg/kg orally once daily for 5 days is recommended to treat the underlying bacterial infection. The child will also receive oxygen therapy via nasal cannula to maintain an oxygen saturation of at least 90%. Follow-up appointments are scheduled for 2 and 7 days post-discharge.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient's parents should contact our clinic if they notice any worsening of symptoms, such as increased difficulty breathing or refusal to drink fluids. The child is expected to make a full recovery with supportive care and antibiotic treatment.
