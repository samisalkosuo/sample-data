Date: January 4, 2024
Location: Isojoki Clinic

Patient Information:
Male, 74 years old

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with complaints of worsening shortness of breath and fatigue over the past week, which has significantly impacted his daily activities.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient reported a gradual increase in dyspnea (shortness of breath) and fatigue, particularly after minimal exertion. He also experienced orthopnea (difficulty breathing while lying down), paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (waking up with shortness of breath), and mild coughing. The patient's symptoms worsened over the past week, leading him to seek medical attention.

Physical Examination Findings:
Given the patient's age and severity level, a thorough physical examination was performed. Vital signs revealed a blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg, pulse of 100 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 92% on room air, and temperature of 37.4°C (99.3°F). The patient exhibited signs of congestive heart failure, including bilateral jugular venous distension and crackles bilaterally in the lungs.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
The patient's presentation is consistent with chronic heart failure, specifically left-sided heart failure. The presence of orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and signs of congestion on physical examination support this diagnosis. Further testing, including an electrocardiogram (ECG) and echocardiogram, was ordered to confirm the diagnosis and assess cardiac function.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient was started on furosemide 40 mg orally twice daily for symptomatic relief of fluid overload and edema. Lisinopril 10 mg orally once daily was initiated for its renoprotective effects and blood pressure management. The patient was also advised to increase his sodium intake to 3,000-4,000 mg per day and to avoid strenuous activities.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient is scheduled for a follow-up appointment in two weeks to reassess his symptoms and adjust his medication regimen as needed. He is also advised to monitor his blood pressure and report any changes to the healthcare provider.
