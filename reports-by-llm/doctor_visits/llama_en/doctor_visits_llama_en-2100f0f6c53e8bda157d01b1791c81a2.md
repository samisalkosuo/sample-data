**Visit Summary**

**Date:** November 6, 2025
**Location:** Joroinen Clinic
**Severity Level:** 4 (Less-urgent â€“ stable, 1 resource)

**Patient Information:**
Female patient, age 92.

**Chief Complaint:**
The patient presented with complaints of worsening shortness of breath and fatigue over the past week. She reported difficulty breathing during exertion and a general feeling of being unwell.

**History of Present Illness (HPI):**
The patient's symptoms began approximately one week ago, with an initial episode of coughing up pink, frothy sputum. Since then, her shortness of breath has worsened, and she has experienced fatigue, particularly in the morning. She also reports a mild fever, which has been present for several days.

**Physical Examination Findings:**
Given the patient's age and severity level, a thorough physical examination was conducted to assess for any underlying conditions contributing to her symptoms. The patient appeared frail but alert, with vital signs within normal limits. Her oxygen saturation was 92% on room air, indicating mild hypoxemia. Lung sounds were clear bilaterally, with no evidence of consolidation or wheezing. Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rhythm and blood pressure within normal limits.

**Assessment / Diagnosis:**
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation was made. The patient's age and history of smoking are consistent with this diagnosis. Further testing, including a chest X-ray and spirometry, may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.

**Plan / Treatment:**
The patient will be started on a short-course inhaler regimen consisting of bronchodilator and corticosteroid therapy. She will also receive oxygen therapy as needed to maintain an oxygen saturation level above 90%. The patient's physician will review her medication list and adjust as necessary to minimize interactions.

**Follow-up Instructions:**
The patient is scheduled for a follow-up appointment in two weeks to assess the effectiveness of treatment and monitor for any signs of worsening symptoms. In the meantime, she should continue to use her inhaler as directed and report any changes in her symptoms or breathing difficulties to her physician.

**Additional Notes:**

* The patient's family members were educated on the importance of oxygen therapy and the need to monitor her oxygen saturation levels.
* A home visit will be arranged for the patient to assess her ability to perform daily activities and provide additional support as needed.
