**Visit Summary**

**Date:** April 8, 2024
**Location:** Lieto Clinic
**Severity Level:** 4 (Less-urgent â€“ stable, 1 resource)

**Patient Information:**
Male patient, age 91 years.

**Chief Complaint:**
The patient presented with complaints of worsening shortness of breath and fatigue over the past week. He reported difficulty breathing during exertion and an increase in oxygen requirements at home.

**History of Present Illness (HPI):**
The patient's symptoms began approximately two weeks ago, following a recent hospitalization for pneumonia. Since then, his condition has progressively worsened, with increasing shortness of breath and fatigue. The patient reports that he is able to perform daily activities with some difficulty but requires more frequent oxygen therapy at home.

**Physical Examination Findings:**
Given the patient's age and severity level, a comprehensive physical examination was performed with a focus on respiratory function. The patient exhibited signs of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including bilateral wheezing and decreased lung sounds in both lungs. His oxygen saturation levels were 92% on room air, indicating mild hypoxemia.

**Assessment / Diagnosis:**
The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of exacerbation of COPD. The patient's age and comorbidities also contribute to his increased risk for respiratory complications.

**Plan / Treatment:**
The patient will be started on oral corticosteroids (prednisone) 40 mg daily for 5-7 days to reduce inflammation and improve lung function. His oxygen therapy will be adjusted as needed to maintain an oxygen saturation level of 90% or higher. The patient will also receive education on proper use of inhalers, smoking cessation counseling, and referrals to pulmonary rehabilitation services.

**Follow-up Instructions:**
The patient is scheduled for a follow-up appointment in two weeks to reassess his condition and adjust treatment as needed. His family members are advised to monitor his oxygen levels closely and report any changes or concerns to the clinic promptly.

**Additional Recommendations:**

* The patient's primary care physician will review his medication list and adjust as necessary.
* A referral to a pulmonologist for further evaluation and management is recommended.
* The patient's home environment should be assessed for potential respiratory hazards, such as tobacco smoke or strong chemicals.
