Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with complaints of persistent and worsening back pain radiating to his left lower extremity, accompanied by swelling in the affected area. He reported difficulty walking and standing for extended periods.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient described a gradual onset of symptoms over the past 2 weeks, starting with mild discomfort while lifting heavy objects at work. Initially, he attributed it to muscle strain but noticed increasing pain and swelling as the days passed. The pain worsened when he stood for more than an hour or engaged in physical activities that required prolonged standing. He reported no fever, chills, or recent travel history.

Physical Examination Findings:
Given the severity level of 5 (non-urgent), the examination focused on assessing the patient's musculoskeletal system and evaluating the extent of his condition. The patient exhibited tenderness over the affected area with swelling that was palpable to 2+ cm in diameter. Range of motion was slightly limited, but no deformity or instability was noted.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
The diagnosis is suspected acute compartment syndrome due to prolonged standing and heavy lifting at work. This condition requires prompt recognition and management to prevent irreversible damage.

Plan / Treatment:
- The patient will be prescribed ibuprofen 400mg orally twice daily for pain management.
- A referral to an orthopedic specialist for further evaluation and potential surgical intervention is recommended.
