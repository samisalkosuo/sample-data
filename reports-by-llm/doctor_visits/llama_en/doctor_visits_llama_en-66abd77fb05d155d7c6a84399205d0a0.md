Location: Kangasala Clinic

Patient Information:
Gender: Female
Age: 47

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with complaints of worsening back pain and fatigue over the past few weeks, which has significantly impacted her daily activities.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient reported a gradual increase in lower back pain, radiating to her left buttock, accompanied by morning stiffness. She also experienced generalized fatigue, which worsened over time. The pain is exacerbated by movement and relieved by rest. Additionally, she noticed some weight loss and difficulty sleeping.

Physical Examination Findings:
Given the severity level of 2 (Emergent â€“ potential life threat), a thorough physical examination was conducted to assess for any underlying conditions that may be contributing to her symptoms. The patient's vital signs were stable, with a blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg, pulse of 72 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. 

A detailed neurological examination revealed tenderness in the left lumbar region, with no evidence of radiculopathy or cauda equina syndrome. The patient's gait was slightly altered due to pain, but no significant weakness or sensory deficits were noted.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of chronic lower back pain with possible lumbar disc herniation is suspected. Further imaging studies (MRI) are recommended to confirm this suspicion.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient was prescribed:

* A 5-day course of oral ibuprofen for pain management
* A referral to an orthopedic specialist for further evaluation and potential surgical intervention

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient is advised to follow up with the orthopedic specialist within two weeks for further evaluation. She should also schedule a follow-up appointment with her primary care physician in six weeks to reassess her condition.
