Visit Summary:

Date: December 8, 2023
Location: Haapavesi Clinic

Patient Information:
Male patient, aged 98 years

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with complaints of worsening shortness of breath and fatigue over the past week.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient reported a gradual increase in difficulty breathing, particularly during exertion. He also experienced generalized weakness and loss of appetite. The patient's oxygen saturation levels have been consistently below 90% on room air. There is no recent history of trauma or significant illness that could explain these symptoms.

Physical Examination Findings:
Given the patient's age and severity level (2), a thorough physical examination was performed to assess for any potential underlying causes of his symptoms. The patient appeared frail, with multiple comorbidities including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Vital signs were as follows: blood pressure 160/90 mmHg, heart rate 110 bpm, respiratory rate 24 breaths/min, oxygen saturation 82% on room air. The patient's lungs were clear to auscultation, but there was evidence of bilateral crackles bilaterally.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of acute exacerbation of COPD with hypoxemia is suspected. Given the patient's age and comorbidities, it is essential to manage his condition carefully to avoid further decline.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient was started on oxygen therapy via nasal cannula at 4 liters/minute, with close monitoring for saturation levels. He was also prescribed a short-acting beta-agonist (SABA) inhaler as needed for acute symptoms. The patient's medications were adjusted to reduce his risk of exacerbation, including reducing his inhaled corticosteroid dose and adding a phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient is scheduled for follow-up in 2 weeks to reassess his oxygen saturation levels and adjust his treatment plan as needed. It is essential that the patient adheres to his medication regimen and follows up promptly if he experiences any worsening symptoms.

Discharge Summary:
The patient was discharged home with instructions on how to use his inhaler, manage his medications, and monitor his oxygen saturation levels. The patient's family members were educated on how to recognize signs of worsening COPD exacerbation and seek immediate medical attention if necessary.
