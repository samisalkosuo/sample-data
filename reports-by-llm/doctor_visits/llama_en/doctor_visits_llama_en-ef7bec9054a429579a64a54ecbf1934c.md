**Location:** Keitele Clinic
**Severity Level:** 3 (Urgent â€“ stable, needs 2+ resources)

**Patient Information:**
- **Gender:** Male
- **Age:** 30 years old

**Chief Complaint:**
The patient presented with a complaint of worsening back pain and recent onset of fatigue.

**History of Present Illness (HPI):**
The patient reported a gradual increase in lower back pain over the past week, which worsened to a level that interfered with his daily activities. He also mentioned experiencing fatigue, particularly after physical exertion, which started about 3 days ago. The patient denied any recent trauma or significant weight loss.

**Physical Examination Findings:**
Given the severity level of 3, the examination revealed tenderness in the lower back region without signs of acute injury. A thorough neurological examination did not reveal any focal deficits. The patient's vital signs were stable with a blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg and a heart rate of 80 beats per minute.

**Assessment / Diagnosis:**
The diagnosis is suspected musculoskeletal strain, likely due to overuse or poor posture. Given the severity level, further diagnostic testing such as imaging (e.g., X-ray) might be considered if symptoms persist or worsen.

**Plan / Treatment:**
- The patient will be prescribed a short course of pain medication (e.g., acetaminophen or ibuprofen) to manage pain and inflammation.
- A physical therapy referral is recommended for strengthening exercises to improve posture and reduce strain on the back muscles.
- The patient is advised to maintain good posture, avoid heavy lifting, and engage in regular exercise.

**Follow-up Instructions:**
The patient should follow up with the clinic in 2 weeks to assess the effectiveness of treatment. If symptoms persist or worsen, further evaluation may be necessary.

**Additional Notes:** It is essential for the patient to report any changes in his condition, including worsening pain or difficulty breathing, as these could indicate a more serious underlying issue requiring immediate attention.
