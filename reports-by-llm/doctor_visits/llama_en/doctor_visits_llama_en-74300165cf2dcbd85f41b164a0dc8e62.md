Patient Information:
Male, aged 38 years

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with complaints of progressive left-sided chest pain radiating to the back, which worsened over the past 24 hours.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient reported a gradual increase in discomfort starting from the evening before, which intensified throughout the night. He described the pain as sharp and stabbing, often accompanied by shortness of breath and a feeling of tightness in his chest. The patient denied any history of heart disease or previous episodes of similar symptoms.

Physical Examination Findings:
Given the severity level of 1, indicating an immediate life-threatening situation, the physical examination was conducted with utmost urgency. Vital signs revealed a blood pressure of 90/60 mmHg, pulse rate of 120 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on room air. The patient's left arm was noted to be slightly swollen, and there were no visible signs of trauma or injury.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
Based on the clinical presentation and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) with possible pulmonary embolism (PE) was made. Further evaluation revealed an elevated troponin level of 10 ng/mL, indicating cardiac damage.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient was immediately administered oxygen via non-rebreather mask, and a 12-lead ECG was performed to confirm the diagnosis. He was also started on aspirin 300 mg orally, clopidogrel 75 mg orally, and heparin 5000 units IV bolus followed by a continuous infusion of 1000 units/hour. The patient was subsequently transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for close monitoring.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient will be seen in the ICU daily for further evaluation and management. A follow-up appointment with cardiology will be scheduled within 72 hours to assess cardiac function and adjust treatment as needed. The patient is advised to return home only when cleared by the healthcare team, and to contact the clinic immediately if they experience any worsening symptoms or chest pain.

Note: Due to the severity of the patient's condition, a more detailed report would typically be generated in an electronic health record system, including additional information such as medication administration records, lab results, and imaging studies.
