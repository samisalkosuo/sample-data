Visit Summary:

Date: December 8, 2023
Location: Ulvila Clinic

Patient Information:
Male, 41 years old

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with complaints of progressive difficulty breathing over the past few days, which has worsened over the past 24 hours.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient reported that he has been experiencing increasing shortness of breath, particularly during physical activity. He described his symptoms as a tight, constricting sensation in his chest and a feeling of suffocation. The patient also reported coughing up small amounts of rust-colored sputum. He denied any fever or chest pain.

Physical Examination Findings:
Given the severity level of 1, the patient's presentation is consistent with an immediate life-threatening situation. The patient was found to be in respiratory distress, with a rapid and shallow breathing rate (24 breaths/min). His oxygen saturation was 92% on room air. The lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally, but there was a notable increase in the anterior chest wall. The patient's blood pressure was 140/90 mmHg, and his pulse was 120 beats/min.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
Based on the patient's presentation, a diagnosis of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is suspected. Further diagnostic testing, including a complete blood count (CBC), basic metabolic panel (BMP), and arterial blood gas (ABG), will be ordered to confirm this diagnosis.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient was immediately admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for close monitoring and aggressive respiratory support. He was placed on a non-invasive ventilation strategy, with a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) setting of 10 cm H2O. The patient also received oxygen therapy via nasal cannula, with an initial flow rate of 6 liters per minute. Medications were ordered to include dexamethasone 4 mg IV q 6 hours and norepinephrine 0.5 mcg/kg/min IV bolus q 10 minutes.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient will be seen in the ICU daily for assessment of his respiratory status and titration of his ventilatory support. A follow-up appointment with a pulmonologist will be scheduled within 72 hours to discuss long-term management and potential lung transplantation.

Discharge Instructions:
None.

Note: The patient's condition is being closely monitored, and any changes in his status will be reported promptly to the attending physician.
