Visit Details:
-----------------

* Visit Date: 16.12.2024
* Severity Level: 2 (Emergent – potential life threat)

Chief Complaint:
----------------

Mr. Kallevala presented with a 2-day history of progressive dyspnea, which worsened over the past 24 hours. He reported feeling short of breath during physical activity and at rest, particularly when lying down.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
---------------------------------

The patient described his symptoms as follows: "I've been feeling like I'm running out of air, even when I'm just sitting or lying down. It's getting worse by the day." He reported no chest pain or cough, but did mention a mild fever (38.5°C) and fatigue. The patient also mentioned that he had noticed an increase in his heart rate (120 bpm) during episodes of dyspnea.

Physical Examination Findings:
------------------------------

Upon examination, the patient appeared anxious and short of breath. His oxygen saturation was 92% on room air. The lungs were clear to auscultation, but the patient did exhibit a mild wheeze bilaterally. The heart rate remained elevated at 120 bpm, with regular rhythm. Blood pressure was 140/90 mmHg.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
-------------------------

Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of acute bronchitis is suspected. The patient's dyspnea and wheezing are consistent with this diagnosis. Given the severity of his symptoms (dyspnea, fever, and elevated heart rate), we consider this an emergent situation.

Plan / Treatment:
-------------------

* Medications: The patient will be prescribed a 5-day course of azithromycin (1g daily) for suspected community-acquired pneumonia.
* Oxygen therapy: The patient will receive supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula at 2L/min to help alleviate dyspnea.
* Monitoring: The patient will be monitored closely for signs of worsening respiratory status, including increased dyspnea, fever, or decreased oxygen saturation.

Follow-up Instructions:
-------------------------

The patient is scheduled for follow-up in 7-10 days to reassess his symptoms and adjust treatment as needed. In the meantime, he should continue to take his prescribed medication and report any changes in his symptoms to our office.

Discharge Summary:
-------------------

Mr. Kallevala was discharged from the clinic with a plan for further evaluation and management of his acute bronchitis. He was advised to follow up with our office in 7-10 days to reassess his condition.
