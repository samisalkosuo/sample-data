Patient Information:
Male, 37 years old

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with complaints of progressive shortness of breath and fatigue over the past week.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient reported that his symptoms began after a strenuous workout three weeks ago. Initially, he experienced mild dyspnea and fatigue, which gradually worsened over time. He has not noticed any chest pain or cough. The patient's symptoms have been exacerbated by physical activity, and he reports feeling short of breath even when sitting still.

Physical Examination Findings:
Given the severity level of 1, the patient's presentation is consistent with a life-threatening condition requiring immediate attention. The patient was found to be in moderate distress, with an oxygen saturation of 92% on room air. His pulse was 110 bpm, and blood pressure was 140/90 mmHg. The lungs were clear to auscultation, but the patient's jugular venous distension (JVD) was noted.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of acute pulmonary edema secondary to exertional heart failure is suspected. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause of this condition.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient was started on oxygen therapy via nasal cannula with a flow rate of 4 liters per minute. He was also administered intravenous furosemide 40 mg IV every 6 hours as needed for dyspnea. The patient's vital signs were closely monitored, and he was placed on cardiac monitoring.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient is to be followed up in the emergency department within 24 hours for further evaluation and management. He is also advised to avoid strenuous activities until further clearance is obtained.
