Visit Summary:

Patient Name: Mr. K. Järvi
Date of Visit: 15.11.2023
Location: Pomarkku Clinic

Chief Complaint:
Mr. Järvi presented with complaints of progressive shortness of breath, fatigue, and decreased mobility over the past few weeks.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient reported that his symptoms began approximately 6 weeks ago, initially worsening gradually. He described feeling winded even when performing light activities, such as walking or gardening. The patient also mentioned experiencing persistent fatigue, which has significantly impacted his daily routine. Notably, he has not experienced any chest pain or palpitations.

Physical Examination Findings:
Given the patient's age and severity level (4), a thorough examination was conducted with caution to avoid exacerbating any potential conditions. Vital signs were within normal limits. The patient's oxygen saturation was 98% on room air. A physical examination revealed no acute abnormalities, but his gait was slightly unsteady due to decreased mobility.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
Based on the patient's symptoms and examination findings, a diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation is suspected. The patient's age and history of smoking are consistent with this diagnosis. Further testing, such as spirometry, may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient was prescribed a short-course inhaler therapy with bronchodilators and a corticosteroid. He will also receive oxygen therapy as needed, starting at 2 L/min via nasal cannula. The patient is advised to maintain a regular exercise routine, including gentle stretching exercises, under the guidance of his primary care physician.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient is scheduled for follow-up in two weeks to reassess his condition and adjust treatment as necessary. In the meantime, he should contact the clinic immediately if his symptoms worsen or if he experiences any concerning signs, such as increased shortness of breath or chest pain.
