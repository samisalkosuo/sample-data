**Visit Summary**

**Date:** December 20, 2024
**Location:** Kristiinankaupunki Clinic
**Severity Level:** 5 (Non-urgent â€“ minor complaints)

**Patient Information:**
Female patient, age 71.

**Chief Complaint:**
The patient presented with a complaint of mild left-sided shoulder pain and stiffness, which she reported had been worsening over the past week. She also mentioned experiencing occasional numbness in her left arm, particularly at night.

**History of Present Illness (HPI):**
The patient described the onset of her symptoms as gradual, starting about 7-10 days ago. The pain is described as a dull ache, worsened by movement and relieved by rest. She also reported experiencing occasional tingling sensations in her left arm, which she believes may be related to her shoulder pain. There was no recent trauma or injury associated with the onset of symptoms.

**Physical Examination Findings:**
Upon examination, the patient's vital signs were within normal limits. The left shoulder was tender to palpation, and there was noticeable stiffness in the range of motion. Neurological examination revealed mild paresthesia (tingling sensation) in the left arm, particularly over the medial aspect of the forearm. No other significant abnormalities were noted.

**Assessment / Diagnosis:**
Based on the patient's presentation, a diagnosis of possible bicipital tendinitis or rotator cuff strain was considered. The presence of numbness and tingling sensations in the left arm may be related to referred pain from the shoulder. Further evaluation with imaging studies (e.g., ultrasound) may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.

**Plan / Treatment:**
The patient will be prescribed a course of analgesics (ibuprofen or acetaminophen) for symptom management and anti-inflammatory effects. A referral to an orthopedic specialist for further evaluation and potential injection therapy (corticosteroid or platelet-rich plasma) may be considered if symptoms persist or worsen.

**Follow-up Instructions:**
The patient is advised to follow up with the clinic in 2 weeks to reassess symptoms and adjust treatment as needed. In the meantime, she should continue to use ice packs for pain management and avoid heavy lifting or strenuous activities that exacerbate her symptoms.

**Additional Notes:** The patient's age and potential underlying comorbidities (e.g., osteoporosis) will be taken into consideration during future evaluations.
