**Location:** Kuusamo Clinic
**Severity Level:** 2 (Emergent â€“ potential life threat)

**Patient Information:**
- **Gender:** Female
- **Age:** 80 years old

**Chief Complaint:**
The patient presented with difficulty breathing and a feeling of impending doom, which she described as "like being suffocating." She reported that these symptoms started approximately 2 hours prior to arrival.

**History of Present Illness (HPI):**
The patient's respiratory symptoms began after she experienced a sudden onset of chest discomfort. She stated that the pain was sharp and stabbing, radiating to her back. The patient also mentioned experiencing lightheadedness and dizziness, which worsened over time. Her oxygen saturation levels were 92% on room air at the time of presentation.

**Physical Examination Findings:**
Upon examination, the patient exhibited signs of respiratory distress, including tachypnea (rapid breathing rate) and bilateral wheezing. Her blood pressure was 160/90 mmHg, and her pulse was 110 beats per minute. The physical exam also revealed a slight decrease in mental status, with the patient appearing anxious and agitated.

**Assessment / Diagnosis:**
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with possible pneumonia was made. The patient's age and comorbidities also contributed to her increased risk for respiratory complications.

**Plan / Treatment:**
The patient was started on oxygen therapy via nasal cannula at 4 liters per minute, with the goal of maintaining an oxygen saturation level above 90%. She was also prescribed a course of antibiotics (amoxicillin-clavulanate) and a bronchodilator inhaler (albuterol). The patient's pain was managed with acetaminophen. Close monitoring for respiratory status and potential complications will be performed.

**Follow-up Instructions:**
The patient is scheduled to follow up in 2 days to assess her response to treatment and adjust the plan as necessary. In the meantime, she should continue to use her inhaler as prescribed and report any worsening symptoms immediately.

**Additional Notes:** The patient's family members were educated on basic life support techniques and encouraged to monitor her oxygen saturation levels at home.
