Patient Information:
- Gender: Male
- Age: 2 years

Chief Complaint:
The patient's mother reported that her 2-year-old son has been experiencing severe abdominal pain and vomiting for the past 24 hours, with episodes of bloody diarrhea.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The child was brought to the clinic in distress, complaining of severe abdominal pain that worsens with feeding. He has had several episodes of projectile vomiting, which have resulted in dehydration. The patient also reports having a few episodes of bloody stools over the past 24 hours. His temperature is 38.5°C (101.3°F), and he appears lethargic.

Physical Examination Findings:
Given the severity of symptoms, a thorough physical examination was conducted to assess for any signs of dehydration or abdominal tenderness. The patient's skin is dry and cool to the touch, with sunken eyes and decreased urine output. Abdominal tenderness is present in the lower quadrant, consistent with an acute abdomen.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
Based on the clinical presentation, a diagnosis of acute gastroenteritis with possible intussusception is suspected. The patient's symptoms are severe enough to warrant immediate attention, given his age and the presence of bloody stools.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient was started on intravenous fluids for rehydration and administered an antacid to manage vomiting. A barium enema study will be performed to assess for intussusception. If necessary, a surgical consultation will be sought to address any potential complications.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient is scheduled for follow-up in 24 hours to reassess his condition and adjust treatment as needed. The mother is advised to continue administering oral rehydration solutions and monitor the child's stool output closely. If symptoms worsen or if there are signs of sepsis, immediate return to the clinic is required.

Severity Level: 3 (Urgent)
