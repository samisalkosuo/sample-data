**Chief Complaint:**
The patient presented with complaints of progressive shortness of breath and fatigue over the past week.

**History of Present Illness (HPI):**
The patient reported that her shortness of breath worsened over time, particularly when walking or climbing stairs. She also experienced significant fatigue, which interfered with her daily activities. The patient denied any chest pain, cough, or fever. Her symptoms began approximately 2 weeks ago and have progressively worsened.

**Physical Examination Findings:**
Given the patient's advanced age and severity level (4), a comprehensive physical examination was performed to assess for potential underlying causes of her symptoms. The patient appeared frail and weak, with significant weight loss noted. Her oxygen saturation levels were 92% on room air, indicating mild hypoxemia. The lungs were clear to auscultation, and the cardiac examination revealed no abnormalities. The patient's vital signs were stable.

**Assessment / Diagnosis:**
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation was made. The patient's age and comorbidities also contributed to her overall clinical picture.

**Plan / Treatment:**
The patient was prescribed oxygen therapy via nasal cannula with a flow rate of 2 liters per minute, starting at 8 am today and continuing for the next 24 hours. She will be followed up in 1 week to reassess her symptoms and adjust treatment as needed. The patient's primary care physician will also contact her home healthcare provider to discuss further management.

**Follow-up Instructions:**
The patient is advised to follow up with her primary care physician in 1 week for a re-evaluation of her condition. She should continue to use oxygen therapy as prescribed and report any changes in symptoms or worsening shortness of breath. Additionally, the patient's home healthcare provider will contact her daily to monitor her oxygen saturation levels and provide support.

**Additional Notes:**
Given the patient's advanced age and severity level, it is essential to closely monitor her condition and adjust treatment accordingly. The patient's family members should be educated on her condition and the importance of following up with her healthcare providers regularly.
