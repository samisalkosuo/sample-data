**Date:** 30.07.2025
**Location:** Juva Clinic
**Severity Level:** 4

**Patient Information:**
- **Gender:** Male
- **Age:** 62 years old

**Chief Complaint:**
The patient presented with complaints of progressive difficulty breathing, particularly in the morning and after exertion, for the past two weeks. He reported feeling short of breath even while sitting still.

**History of Present Illness (HPI):**
The patient's symptoms began approximately three weeks ago, worsening over time. Initially, he experienced mild discomfort but gradually progressed to more pronounced difficulty breathing. The patient described his breathing as "shallow" and noted that he often feels lightheaded upon standing up from a seated position. He has not experienced any chest pain or coughing up blood. Despite these symptoms, the patient reported feeling generally well, with no fever or other systemic complaints.

**Physical Examination Findings:**
Upon examination, the patient exhibited signs of respiratory distress, including increased respiratory rate (24 breaths per minute) and use of accessory muscles for breathing. His oxygen saturation was 92% on room air. The patient's vital signs were as follows: blood pressure 140/90 mmHg, pulse 110 beats per minute, temperature 98.6°F (37°C), and respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute. The physical examination revealed no abnormalities in the lungs or heart.

**Assessment / Diagnosis:**
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation is suspected. The patient's history of smoking (30 pack-years) supports this diagnosis. Further evaluation with pulmonary function tests may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.

**Plan / Treatment:**
The patient was prescribed the following medications:
- Albuterol inhaler for symptom relief
- Fluticasone inhaler for long-term control of COPD symptoms
- Levalburol inhaler as needed for acute exacerbations

Additionally, the patient was advised to increase his physical activity gradually and avoid exposure to pollutants. Follow-up appointments will be scheduled in two weeks for reevaluation.

**Follow-up Instructions:**
The patient is instructed to follow up with our clinic in two weeks for a reassessment of his condition. In the meantime, he should continue to use his inhalers as directed and report any worsening symptoms immediately.
