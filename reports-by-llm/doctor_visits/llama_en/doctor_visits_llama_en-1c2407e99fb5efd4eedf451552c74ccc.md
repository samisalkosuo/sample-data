**Visit Summary**

**Date:** March 15, 2025
**Location:** Multia Clinic
**Patient Information:**
- **Gender:** Male
- **Age:** 82 years old

**Chief Complaint:**
The patient presented with complaints of worsening shortness of breath and fatigue over the past week.

**History of Present Illness (HPI):**
The patient reported a gradual increase in difficulty breathing, particularly during exertion, which has led to reduced activity levels. He also mentioned feeling increasingly fatigued, even after resting, and experiencing mild chest discomfort that worsens with deep breathing. The symptoms began approximately 2 weeks ago and have progressively worsened.

**Physical Examination Findings:**
Given the patient's age and severity level (3), a thorough physical examination was conducted to assess for any underlying causes of his symptoms. Vital signs were within normal limits, but oxygen saturation was slightly decreased at 92% on room air. The patient exhibited mild bilateral wheezing and a low-grade fever of 38.5Â°C. A chest X-ray would be necessary to fully evaluate the lungs.

**Assessment / Diagnosis:**
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation is suspected. The patient's age and history of smoking further support this diagnosis. Further evaluation with a chest X-ray and possibly a pulmonary function test may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.

**Plan / Treatment:**
The patient was prescribed a short course of oral corticosteroids for acute bronchospasm management, as well as an inhaler containing a bronchodilator. He will also receive oxygen therapy at home to help manage his symptoms and improve oxygen saturation levels. Follow-up appointments are scheduled for 1 week after discharge from the hospital to assess the effectiveness of treatment.

**Follow-up Instructions:**
The patient is advised to follow up with his primary care physician in one week to reassess his condition and adjust treatment as necessary. In the meantime, he should continue to use his inhaler as directed and monitor his oxygen saturation levels closely. If symptoms worsen or do not improve with treatment, he should contact his healthcare provider immediately.

**Additional Notes:**
The patient's family was informed of his diagnosis and treatment plan, and they were advised on how to manage his condition at home. A referral for pulmonary rehabilitation services will be made if deemed necessary post-discharge.
