Varkaus Clinic Visit Summary

Visit Date: August 27, 2024

Patient Information:
- Gender: Female
- Age: 20 years old

Severity Level: 4 (Less-urgent â€“ stable, 1 resource)

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with a complaint of worsening fatigue and shortness of breath over the past week. She reported difficulty breathing during physical activity and experiencing dizziness upon standing.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient's symptoms began approximately two weeks ago, following an upper respiratory tract infection. Initially, she experienced mild cough and congestion but gradually worsened to include significant fatigue and shortness of breath. The patient denied any chest pain or fever in the past 24 hours. She also reported no recent exposure to allergens or irritants.

Physical Examination Findings:
Upon examination, the patient appeared pale with a slightly elevated pulse (110 bpm) and normal respiratory rate (16 breaths/min). Her oxygen saturation was 92% on room air. The lungs were clear to auscultation, and there was no evidence of wheezing or crackles. The heart was within normal limits, and peripheral pulses were 2+.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
Given the patient's age, symptoms, and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) with exertional dyspnea is considered likely. Further testing may be necessary to rule out other potential causes such as anemia or hypothyroidism.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient will be prescribed 500 mg of iron supplement orally once daily for the next two weeks, starting immediately. Additionally, she will receive a prescription for 25 mcg of levothyroxine (T4) to evaluate for possible hypothyroidism. The patient is advised to maintain a balanced diet rich in fruits and vegetables, avoid heavy lifting or strenuous exercise until further notice.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient should follow up with the clinic in two weeks to assess her response to treatment and adjust as necessary. She will also be scheduled for a follow-up appointment with an endocrinologist if the levothyroxine prescription is deemed necessary.
