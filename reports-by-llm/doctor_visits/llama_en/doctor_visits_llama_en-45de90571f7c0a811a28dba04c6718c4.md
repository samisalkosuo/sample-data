Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with complaints of worsening shortness of breath and fatigue over the past two weeks, which have progressively worsened despite increasing physical activity.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient reported a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. She described her symptoms as starting with mild dyspnea on exertion, which gradually increased in severity to moderate shortness of breath at rest. The patient also experienced fatigue, particularly after morning activities, and reported feeling weak and lacking energy. Over the past week, she has noticed a decrease in her ability to perform daily tasks due to these symptoms.

Physical Examination Findings:

Assessment / Diagnosis:
Based on the patient's symptoms, history, and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction was made. The severity level of this condition is 4, indicating that while it poses a significant threat to her quality of life, it does not represent an immediate life-threatening situation.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient will be started on lisinopril 10mg daily and furosemide 40mg twice daily for management of hypertension and fluid overload. She will also be prescribed metoprolol succinate 50mg twice daily for rate control. The patient is advised to increase her salt intake and avoid strenuous activities until further evaluation.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient will be scheduled for a follow-up appointment in two weeks to reassess her condition and adjust medication as needed. She is also advised to contact the clinic immediately if she experiences worsening symptoms, such as increased shortness of breath or chest pain.

Discharge Summary:

The patient was discharged with instructions on managing her chronic heart failure and will be monitored closely for any changes in her condition.
