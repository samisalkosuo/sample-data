Location: Hollolla Clinic

Patient Information:
Gender: Female
Age: 13

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with a 2-day history of worsening abdominal pain, accompanied by nausea and vomiting.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient reported that her symptoms began after consuming a large meal at school. The pain initially started as a mild cramp but gradually intensified over the past 24 hours. She described the pain as sharp and stabbing, located in the upper right quadrant of her abdomen. Nausea and vomiting followed shortly after the onset of pain. The patient reported no fever, diarrhea, or blood in her stool.

Physical Examination Findings:
Given the severity level of 3 (Urgent â€“ stable, needs 2+ resources), a thorough physical examination was performed. Vital signs were within normal limits. Abdominal tenderness was noted in the upper right quadrant, with guarding present. The patient's abdomen was also slightly distended. No masses or rebound tenderness were detected.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of acute appendicitis is suspected. Further diagnostic testing, including imaging studies (e.g., ultrasound), may be necessary to confirm this diagnosis.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient will undergo immediate imaging studies to confirm the diagnosis. If appendicitis is confirmed, surgical consultation will be sought for potential appendectomy. The patient will also receive antibiotics as prescribed by the surgeon to reduce the risk of post-operative complications.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient should follow up with the surgeon within 24-48 hours to discuss further management and scheduling of surgery. In the meantime, the patient is advised to rest and avoid strenuous activities. If symptoms worsen or new symptoms develop (e.g., fever, severe abdominal pain), the patient should contact the clinic immediately.

Note: The severity level of 3 indicates that the patient's condition requires immediate attention but is still stable. The plan and treatment outlined above are tailored to address this level of urgency while also considering the patient's age and profile.
