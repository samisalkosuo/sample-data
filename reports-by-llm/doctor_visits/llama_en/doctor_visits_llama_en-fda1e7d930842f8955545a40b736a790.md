**Date:** November 1, 2025
**Location:** Sysmä Clinic
**Severity Level:** 4 (Less-urgent – stable, 1 resource)

**Patient Information:**
Male patient, age 12

**Chief Complaint:**
The patient presented with a 2-day history of progressive abdominal pain and vomiting.

**History of Present Illness (HPI):**
The patient reported that his symptoms began 2 days ago, worsening over the past 24 hours. He described the pain as crampy and located in the upper right quadrant of his abdomen. Vomiting has been present for most of this time, with some episodes of diarrhea. The patient denied any fever or recent travel.

**Physical Examination Findings:**
Given the severity level of 4, a thorough physical examination was performed to assess for any potential complications. The patient appeared stable and alert, with no signs of dehydration (e.g., no sunken eyes, dry mucous membranes). Abdominal tenderness was noted in the upper right quadrant, but no guarding or rebound tenderness were present. The vital signs were within normal limits.

**Assessment / Diagnosis:**
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of acute appendicitis is suspected. Further evaluation with imaging studies (e.g., ultrasound) may be necessary to confirm this diagnosis.

**Plan / Treatment:**
The patient will be admitted for observation and treatment. Antibiotics will be administered to cover potential bacterial infection. The patient will also receive intravenous fluids to maintain hydration. A surgical consultation will be obtained to discuss the possibility of appendectomy.

**Follow-up Instructions:**
The patient is scheduled for follow-up in 24 hours to reassess his condition and determine if surgery is necessary. In the meantime, the patient should continue to rest and avoid strenuous activities. If symptoms worsen or new symptoms develop (e.g., fever, severe abdominal pain), the patient should contact the clinic immediately.

**Additional Notes:**
The patient's parents will be contacted to discuss the diagnosis and treatment plan in more detail. A referral to a pediatric surgeon will be made if surgery is deemed necessary.
