Patient Information:
Male, 44 years old

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with complaints of worsening back pain and fatigue over the past week, which has significantly impacted his daily activities.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient reported a gradual increase in lower back pain, radiating to his left buttock, accompanied by morning stiffness. He also experienced fatigue, particularly after physical activity, and reported difficulty sleeping due to discomfort. The pain worsened over the past week, with an exacerbation during heavy lifting at work on Tuesday.

Physical Examination Findings:
Given the severity level of 2 (Emergent – potential life threat), a thorough examination was conducted to assess for any underlying causes of the patient's symptoms. Vital signs were within normal limits. The patient exhibited tenderness and guarding in the left lumbar region, with positive straight leg raise test. Range of motion was limited due to pain.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
The patient's presentation is suggestive of acute lumbosacral strain, likely caused by heavy lifting at work. Further evaluation revealed no signs of neurological compromise or systemic illness. A diagnosis of acute lumbosacral strain was made.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient will be prescribed 500mg of ibuprofen three times daily for pain management and inflammation reduction. He is also advised to rest, avoid heavy lifting, and engage in gentle stretching exercises to maintain range of motion. A referral to the orthopedic department for further evaluation and potential imaging (e.g., X-ray or MRI) will be made.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient should follow up with the clinic in two weeks to reassess his symptoms and adjust treatment as needed. In the meantime, he is advised to monitor his pain levels and report any worsening symptoms to the clinic.
