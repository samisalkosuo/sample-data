Visit Summary:

Patient Name: Mr. John Doe
Date of Visit: April 9, 2023
Location: Alavieska Clinic

Chief Complaint:
Mr. Doe presented with complaints of progressive shortness of breath and fatigue over the past week, which have worsened over the past few days.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient reported that he has been experiencing increasing difficulty breathing, particularly during exertion, and has noticed a decrease in his overall energy levels. He also mentioned feeling weak and dizzy at times. The symptoms started approximately 7-10 days ago and have progressively worsened. Mr. Doe denied any recent travel or exposure to new environments that could be contributing factors.

Physical Examination Findings:
Given the patient's age (103 years) and severity level of 3, a thorough physical examination was conducted with caution to avoid exacerbating his condition. Vital signs were stable, but oxygen saturation was slightly low at 92% on room air. The patient's respiratory rate was 24 breaths per minute, and his blood pressure was 140/80 mmHg. A chest X-ray revealed bilateral infiltrates consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
Based on the patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, and history, a diagnosis of COPD exacerbation was made. The patient's age and comorbidities also contributed to the severity of his condition.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient was started on oxygen therapy with a flow rate of 4 liters per minute, and he was prescribed oral corticosteroids (prednisone) 40 mg daily for 5 days. Additionally, Mr. Doe was advised to use an inhaler as directed by his primary care physician. The patient's family members were educated on the importance of monitoring his oxygen saturation levels and reporting any changes in his symptoms.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient is scheduled for a follow-up appointment in 2 weeks to reassess his condition and adjust his treatment plan as needed. His primary care physician will contact him to discuss further management options, including potential pulmonary rehabilitation referrals.

Discharge Summary:
Mr. Doe was discharged home with instructions on oxygen therapy and medication management. His family members were advised to seek immediate medical attention if he experiences any worsening of symptoms or signs of respiratory distress.
