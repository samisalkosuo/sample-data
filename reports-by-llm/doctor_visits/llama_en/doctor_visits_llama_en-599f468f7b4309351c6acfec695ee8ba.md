**Visit Summary**

**Date:** December 10, 2024
**Location:** Kempele Clinic
**Severity Level:** 5 (Non-urgent â€“ minor complaints)

**Patient Information:**
Female patient, age 102 years.

**Chief Complaint:**
The patient presented with a complaint of mild fatigue and shortness of breath, which she reported had been worsening over the past few weeks. She also mentioned experiencing occasional dizziness upon standing.

**History of Present Illness (HPI):**
The patient's symptoms began approximately 6 weeks ago, with an initial onset of fatigue that gradually worsened. Over time, she has experienced shortness of breath, particularly during exertion or when lying down. The patient reported feeling dizzy on occasion, especially upon standing up from a seated position. Despite these symptoms, the patient has been able to maintain her daily activities without significant distress.

**Physical Examination Findings:**
Given the patient's age and severity level, a thorough physical examination was conducted with caution to avoid exacerbating any potential underlying conditions. The patient appeared alert and oriented, with no acute distress or discomfort. Vital signs were within normal limits. A review of her medical history revealed no recent illnesses or injuries that could be contributing to her symptoms.

**Assessment / Diagnosis:**
Based on the patient's presentation and physical examination findings, it is likely that she is experiencing age-related decline in cardiovascular function, which may be contributing to her fatigue and shortness of breath. The dizziness upon standing is also consistent with orthostatic hypotension, a common condition in older adults.

**Plan / Treatment:**
The patient will be prescribed a low-dose beta-blocker (metoprolol) to help manage her symptoms and reduce the risk of cardiovascular complications. Additionally, she will be advised on measures to improve her overall health, including regular exercise, dietary modifications, and stress management techniques. The patient's family members will also receive education on recognizing signs of dehydration and the importance of monitoring her medication regimen.

**Follow-up Instructions:**
The patient is scheduled for a follow-up appointment in 6 weeks to reassess her symptoms and adjust her treatment plan as needed. In the meantime, she should report any changes in her symptoms or concerns to her primary care provider promptly.

**Additional Notes:**

* The patient's family members will be contacted to discuss her care plan and provide support.
* A referral to a geriatrician for further evaluation and management of her cardiovascular risk factors has been made.
* The patient's medication regimen will be reviewed in 3 months to ensure optimal management of her symptoms.
