He described the pain as radiating down his left leg and into his buttock. The patient also mentioned experiencing fatigue, particularly after physical activity, and difficulty sleeping due to discomfort. He denied any recent trauma or significant weight loss.

A thorough neurological examination revealed no focal deficits or weakness in the left leg.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient is advised to follow up with the orthopedic department within two weeks to reassess his condition. In the meantime, he should continue taking ibuprofen as directed and maintain a regular exercise routine to improve overall fitness and reduce discomfort.
