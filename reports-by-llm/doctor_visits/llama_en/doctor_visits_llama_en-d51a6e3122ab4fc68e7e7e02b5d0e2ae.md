**Visit Summary**

**Date:** August 8, 2024
**Location:** Pyhäranta Clinic
**Severity Level:** 5 (Non-urgent – minor complaints)

**Patient Information:**
Male patient, age 6 years.

**Chief Complaint:**
The patient presented with a mild rash on his left arm, which he noticed during the summer vacation. He reported that it started as a small, itchy spot and has been gradually spreading over the past few days.

**History of Present Illness (HPI):**
The patient described the rash as red and slightly scaly, with some minor itching and pruritus. He mentioned that he had recently spent time outdoors playing in the woods, where he may have come into contact with unknown allergens or irritants. The rash has not been accompanied by any systemic symptoms such as fever, chills, or malaise.

**Physical Examination Findings:**
Upon examination, a mild, erythematous rash was observed on the patient's left arm, measuring approximately 5 cm in diameter. The rash was tender to the touch and had some minor scaling. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.

**Assessment / Diagnosis:**
Based on the patient's presentation and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of mild contact dermatitis is suspected. This condition is likely caused by an allergic reaction or irritation from exposure to unknown substances during outdoor activities. Further evaluation may include patch testing to identify specific allergens.

**Plan / Treatment:**
The patient will be prescribed a topical corticosteroid cream (0.05% hydrocortisone) to reduce inflammation and itching. The patient is also advised to avoid further exposure to the suspected allergen or irritant until the rash has fully resolved. Follow-up appointments will be scheduled in 3-5 days to assess the response to treatment.

**Follow-up Instructions:**
The patient should return for follow-up appointments on August 12, 2024, and August 19, 2024, to monitor the resolution of the rash. In the meantime, the patient is advised to keep the affected area clean and dry, and to avoid scratching or rubbing the area.

**Additional Notes:**
The patient's parents were provided with information on how to manage their child's symptoms at home, including applying topical corticosteroid cream as directed and avoiding further exposure to potential allergens.
