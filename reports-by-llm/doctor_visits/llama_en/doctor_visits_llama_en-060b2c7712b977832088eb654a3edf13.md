**Date:** March 12, 2024
**Location:** Kauhajoki Clinic
**Severity Level:** 2 (Emergent â€“ potential life threat)

**Patient Information:**
- **Gender:** Male
- **Age:** 43 years old

**Chief Complaint:**
The patient presented with a 2-day history of progressive left-sided chest pain, which worsened over the past 24 hours. He reported difficulty breathing and a feeling of tightness in his chest.

**History of Present Illness (HPI):**
The patient described the onset of symptoms as sudden and severe, starting approximately 48 hours ago. Initially, he experienced mild discomfort, but it rapidly progressed to sharp, stabbing pains that radiated to his left arm. He also reported shortness of breath, particularly during exertion, and a feeling of anxiety. The pain was exacerbated by deep breathing and movement.

**Physical Examination Findings:**
Upon examination, the patient exhibited signs consistent with an acute coronary syndrome (ACS). His pulse was 102 beats per minute, blood pressure was 160/90 mmHg, and oxygen saturation was 92% on room air. The left sternal border was tender to palpation, and there were no other notable findings.

**Assessment / Diagnosis:**
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is suspected. Further testing, including an electrocardiogram (ECG), troponin levels, and echocardiography, will be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.

**Plan / Treatment:**
The patient was immediately admitted to the coronary care unit for further evaluation and management. He received aspirin 325 mg orally, clopidogrel 75 mg orally, and a beta-blocker (metoprolol succinate) 50 mg sublingually. An ECG showed ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, and aVL, confirming the diagnosis of STEMI. The patient was also administered heparin 60 units/kg IV bolus followed by a continuous infusion of 1000 units/hour.

**Follow-up Instructions:**
The patient will be scheduled for an urgent echocardiogram within the next 24 hours to assess cardiac function and guide further management. He is to follow up with his primary care physician in one week to review medication adherence and adjust treatment as necessary. The patient should also attend a follow-up appointment with the cardiology team in two weeks.

**Additional Notes:**
The patient's family members were informed of the diagnosis, and they will be contacted for further instructions regarding the patient's care plan.
