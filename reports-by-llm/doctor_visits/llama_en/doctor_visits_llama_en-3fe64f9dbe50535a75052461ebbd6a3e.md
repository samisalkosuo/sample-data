Chief Complaint:
----------------

Mr. Lindström reported experiencing worsening shortness of breath over the past few days, which has progressively increased in severity. He also mentioned a persistent cough with yellow sputum production.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
---------------------------------

The patient's symptoms began approximately 7-10 days ago, initially presenting as mild dyspnea that worsened over time. The shortness of breath is exacerbated by exertion and relieved by rest. Mr. Lindström has also noticed an increase in coughing, which produces yellowish sputum. He reports no fever or chest pain.

Physical Examination Findings:
------------------------------

Given the patient's age and symptoms, a thorough physical examination was conducted to assess for any underlying conditions that may be contributing to his respiratory distress. The patient's vital signs were:

* Blood Pressure: 160/90 mmHg
* Pulse: 110 bpm
* Respiratory Rate: 24 breaths/min
* Oxygen Saturation (SpO2): 92% on room air

The physical examination revealed bilateral wheezes and crackles in the lungs, consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation. The patient's lung fields were clear to auscultation.

Assessment/Diagnosis:
------------------------

Based on the patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, and history of COPD, a diagnosis of acute exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD) was made. The patient's oxygen saturation levels indicate mild hypoxemia, which warrants close monitoring.

Plan/Treatment:
-----------------

The patient will be started on high-flow nasal cannula therapy to improve oxygenation and reduce work of breathing. He will also receive a prescription for salmeterol inhaler (50 mcg twice daily) and fluticasone inhaler (250 mcg once daily). The patient is advised to use his inhalers as directed and to avoid smoking.

Follow-up Instructions:
-------------------------

The patient will be scheduled for follow-up in 2 weeks to reassess his condition. In the meantime, Mr. Lindström should contact the clinic if he experiences any worsening symptoms or requires additional oxygen therapy.

Severity Level: 3 (Urgent)

Note: The severity level of 3 indicates that the patient's condition is stable but requires 2+ resources for management.
