**Visit Summary**

**Date:** July 8, 2023
**Location:** Imatra Clinic
**Severity Level:** 5 (Non-urgent â€“ minor complaints)

**Patient Information:**
Female patient, age 4 years.

**Chief Complaint:**
The patient's mother reported a mild rash on her child's arm, which appeared 2 days ago. The rash is described as small, flat, and slightly itchy, with no signs of infection or discomfort.

**History of Present Illness (HPI):**
The patient was otherwise healthy until the onset of the rash. There were no preceding illnesses, injuries, or exposure to potential allergens. The mother reported that her child had been playing outside in the sun recently and may have scratched herself on a thorn bush. The rash has not changed in size or color over the past 2 days.

**Physical Examination Findings:**
The patient's arm was examined, revealing several small, flat lesions with a diameter of approximately 1-2 cm. These lesions were lightly itchy to the touch and did not exhibit any signs of inflammation, redness, or swelling. The rest of the examination revealed no other abnormalities.

**Assessment / Diagnosis:**
Based on the physical examination findings, the patient is diagnosed with a mild, self-limiting rash likely caused by an allergic reaction to minor skin irritation (e.g., thorn bush scratch). No systemic symptoms were noted, and there is no indication of infection or other underlying conditions.

**Plan / Treatment:**
The patient will be prescribed a topical antihistamine cream to alleviate itching and reduce the risk of further scratching. The mother is advised to apply the cream 2-3 times daily as needed and to monitor the rash for any changes in size, color, or severity. Follow-up appointments will be scheduled in 1 week to assess the patient's progress.

**Follow-up Instructions:**
The patient should return to the clinic in 1 week for a follow-up examination to assess the resolution of the rash. In the meantime, the mother is advised to keep a close eye on the rash and contact the clinic if any signs of infection or worsening symptoms develop.
