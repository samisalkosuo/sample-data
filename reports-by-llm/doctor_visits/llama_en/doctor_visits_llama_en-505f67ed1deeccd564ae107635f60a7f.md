History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient reported feeling increasingly short of breath, even when performing light physical activities. He also experienced fatigue, particularly in the morning, which has made it difficult for him to carry out his daily routine. The patient denied any chest pain or coughing up blood. His symptoms worsened over the past two days, prompting him to seek medical attention.

Physical Examination Findings:

A chest X-ray was ordered to assess for any pulmonary complications.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient was prescribed a short-course inhaler therapy with salbutamol and fluticasone propionate, to be taken as directed by the pharmacist. He was also advised to use a peak flow meter regularly to monitor his lung function. The patient's doctor recommended that he avoid strenuous activities for the next two weeks and follow up in one week.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient is scheduled to return to the clinic in one week for a follow-up appointment, where his progress will be assessed and any necessary adjustments made to his treatment plan.
