Patient Information:
- Gender: Female

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with complaints of worsening shortness of breath and fatigue over the past week.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient reported that her shortness of breath worsened gradually, particularly during exertion. She also experienced increased fatigue, which has been persistent for several days. The patient mentioned that she had a recent fall at home, but denied any other significant symptoms or injuries. Her oxygen saturation levels were found to be 92% on room air.

Physical Examination Findings:
Upon examination, the patient appeared frail and weak, with difficulty breathing during exertion. Her vital signs showed a blood pressure of 160/90 mmHg, pulse rate of 100 beats per minute, and respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute. The physical examination revealed no acute abnormalities.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
Given the patient's age and history of recent falls, it is essential to consider potential causes for her shortness of breath, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pneumonia, or cardiac issues. However, considering the severity level 4, these concerns are less pressing than other factors.

The patient was prescribed oxygen therapy via a nasal cannula with a flow rate of 2 liters per minute for 24 hours. She will also receive a follow-up appointment in one week to reassess her condition and adjust treatment as necessary.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient is advised to contact the clinic if she experiences any worsening symptoms, such as increased shortness of breath or chest pain. Additionally, she should continue to take her prescribed medications as directed by her pharmacist.
