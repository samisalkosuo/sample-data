**Location:** Sund Clinic
**Severity Level:** 3 (Urgent)

**Patient Information:**
- **Gender:** Male
- **Age:** 76 years old

**Chief Complaint:**
The patient presented with complaints of worsening shortness of breath and fatigue over the past week.

**History of Present Illness (HPI):**
The patient reported a gradual increase in difficulty breathing, particularly during exertion. He also mentioned feeling increasingly fatigued, which has affected his ability to perform daily activities. The symptoms worsened over the past few days, prompting him to seek medical attention. There is no history of chest pain or cough.

**Physical Examination Findings:**
Given the patient's age and severity level, a thorough physical examination was conducted with caution to avoid exacerbating any potential conditions. Vital signs were as follows:
- **Temperature:** 98.6°F (37°C)
- **Blood Pressure:** 140/90 mmHg
- **Heart Rate:** 100 beats per minute
- **Respiratory Rate:** 24 breaths per minute

The patient's oxygen saturation was 92% on room air, indicating mild hypoxemia. The lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally. Cardiac examination revealed a regular rhythm with no murmurs or gallops. The abdomen was soft and non-tender.

**Assessment / Diagnosis:**
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation is suspected. Given the severity level, it is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and provide supportive care.

**Plan / Treatment:**
- **Medications:** The patient will be prescribed a short-course inhaler containing bronchodilator medication (e.g., albuterol) for symptom relief.
- **Oxygen Therapy:** Continuous oxygen therapy at 2 liters per minute via nasal cannula will be initiated to improve oxygen saturation levels.
- **Monitoring:** The patient will be closely monitored for signs of worsening respiratory distress, including increased shortness of breath, chest pain, or cyanosis.

**Follow-up Instructions:**
The patient is scheduled for a follow-up appointment in 2 weeks. In the meantime, he should continue to use his inhaler as directed and report any changes in symptoms to his healthcare provider. It is also essential for him to maintain good lung hygiene practices, including regular cleaning of his home environment.

**Additional Instructions:**
The patient's family members or caregivers are advised to monitor his oxygen saturation levels closely and seek immediate medical attention if they notice any signs of worsening respiratory distress.
