**Visit Summary**

**Date:** July 12, 2023
**Location:** Tammela Clinic
**Severity Level:** 3 (Urgent)

**Patient Information:**
Male patient, age 97 years.

**Chief Complaint:**
The patient presented with complaints of worsening shortness of breath and fatigue over the past week. He reported difficulty breathing during exertion and an overall feeling of exhaustion.

**History of Present Illness (HPI):**
The patient's symptoms began approximately two weeks ago, following a recent hospitalization for pneumonia. Since then, his condition has progressively worsened, with increasing shortness of breath and fatigue. The patient reports that he is able to perform daily activities with significant difficulty and requires regular breaks to rest.

**Physical Examination Findings:**
Given the patient's age and severity level, a thorough physical examination was conducted to assess for any underlying conditions contributing to his symptoms. Vital signs were stable, with a blood pressure of 140/80 mmHg, pulse of 100 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on room air. The patient exhibited significant respiratory distress during exertion, with decreased lung sounds bilaterally. Cardiovascular examination revealed no acute abnormalities.

**Assessment / Diagnosis:**
Based on the patient's history and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation is suspected. The patient's age, recent hospitalization for pneumonia, and worsening symptoms over time support this diagnosis. Further testing, including pulmonary function tests and possibly a chest X-ray, may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.

**Plan / Treatment:**
The patient will be started on oxygen therapy via nasal cannula, with titration as needed to maintain an oxygen saturation of 88% or higher. The patient will also receive bronchodilator medication via inhaler, as prescribed by his primary care physician. A follow-up appointment will be scheduled for the following week to reassess the patient's condition and adjust treatment as necessary.

**Follow-up Instructions:**
The patient is advised to follow up with his primary care physician in one week to assess the effectiveness of treatment and make any necessary adjustments. The patient should also contact the clinic immediately if he experiences worsening shortness of breath, chest pain, or other concerning symptoms.
