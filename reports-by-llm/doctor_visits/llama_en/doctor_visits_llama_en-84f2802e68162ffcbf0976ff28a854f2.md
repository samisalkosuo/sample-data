Visit Summary:

Date: April 1, 2024
Location: Nurmij√§rvi Clinic

Patient Information:
Female patient, age 68 years

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with complaints of worsening shortness of breath and fatigue over the past few weeks.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient reported a gradual increase in symptoms, starting with mild exertional dyspnea that worsened over time. She also experienced fatigue, particularly in the morning, which interfered with her daily activities. The patient denied any chest pain or coughing up blood. Her symptoms have progressively worsened over the past few weeks.

Physical Examination Findings:
Given the severity of the patient's symptoms and age, a thorough physical examination was performed to assess for potential underlying causes. Vital signs were within normal limits. Oxygen saturation was 92% on room air. The lungs were clear to auscultation. Cardiac examination revealed a slightly elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP) without any notable murmurs or gallops. The patient's extremities were cool and pale, indicating possible decreased peripheral perfusion.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction was made. The elevated JVP and decreased oxygen saturation suggest potential fluid overload and decreased cardiac output.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient will be started on furosemide 40 mg orally twice daily for symptomatic relief of edema and shortness of breath. She will also receive lisinopril 10 mg orally once daily to reduce blood pressure and alleviate strain on the heart. The patient is advised to increase her salt intake and avoid strenuous activities until further evaluation.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient will be scheduled for a follow-up appointment in two weeks to reassess her symptoms and adjust medication as needed. She is also advised to contact the clinic immediately if she experiences any worsening of symptoms, such as increased shortness of breath or chest pain.

Severity Level: 3 (Urgent)
