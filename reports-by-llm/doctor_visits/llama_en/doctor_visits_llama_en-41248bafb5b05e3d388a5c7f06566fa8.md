**Visit Summary**

**Date:** June 9, 2023
**Location:** Kerava Clinic
**Severity Level:** 5 (Non-urgent â€“ minor complaints)

**Patient Information:**
Female patient, age 34.

**Chief Complaint:**
The patient presented with a complaint of mild, itchy skin lesions on her arms and legs. She reported that the lesions have been present for approximately 2 weeks and have worsened slightly over the past few days.

**History of Present Illness (HPI):**
The patient described the lesions as small, raised patches with a slight scaling texture. They are most prominent on her forearms and upper thighs. The patient reports that she has not experienced any pain or discomfort associated with the lesions. She also mentioned that she has been experiencing mild itching, which she finds manageable with over-the-counter antihistamines.

**Physical Examination Findings:**
Upon examination, the lesions were found to be small, well-defined, and slightly raised. They were most prominent on the patient's forearms and upper thighs. The skin was otherwise normal in appearance. No other abnormalities were noted during the physical examination.

**Assessment / Diagnosis:**
Based on the patient's presentation and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of mild dermatitis is suspected. The lesions are likely caused by an allergic reaction to an environmental factor or food item. Further evaluation may be necessary to determine the specific cause of the dermatitis.

**Plan / Treatment:**
The patient will be prescribed a topical corticosteroid cream (0.05% hydrocortisone) to be applied twice daily for 7-10 days. The patient is also advised to avoid scratching the affected areas and to use cool compresses to reduce itching. If the symptoms worsen or do not improve with treatment, further evaluation may be necessary.

**Follow-up Instructions:**
The patient will be scheduled for a follow-up appointment in 2 weeks to assess the response to treatment. In the meantime, the patient is advised to continue applying the topical corticosteroid cream as directed and to contact the clinic if she experiences any worsening of symptoms or if she has any concerns.

**Additional Notes:**
The patient was counseled on sun protection measures to prevent further irritation of the skin lesions. She was also advised to avoid scratching the affected areas, which can lead to infection and scarring.
