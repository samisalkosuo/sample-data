Date: October 6, 2025
Location: Nurmijärvi Clinic

Patient Information:
- Gender: Male
- Age: 35 years

Severity Level: 4 (Less-urgent – stable, 1 resource)

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with complaints of persistent left-sided chest pain radiating to the back, which worsened over the past few days. He reported no fever, shortness of breath, or other systemic symptoms.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient described a gradual onset of chest discomfort starting 2 days ago, which initially improved with rest but has since returned and intensified. The pain is sharp and stabbing in nature, exacerbated by deep breathing and movement. He denied any history of heart disease, hypertension, or smoking.

Physical Examination Findings:
Vital signs were within normal limits (BP: 120/80 mmHg, HR: 72 bpm, RR: 16 breaths/min). The patient's oxygen saturation was 98% on room air. A thorough physical examination revealed no acute distress, but the left sternal border showed tenderness to palpation.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
Given the patient's age and lack of risk factors for coronary artery disease, a primary concern is musculoskeletal strain or costochondritis. The chest pain could also be indicative of a musculoskeletal issue such as a pulled intercostal muscle. Further evaluation with imaging studies (e.g., X-ray) may be necessary to rule out other causes.

Plan / Treatment:
- The patient was advised to rest and avoid strenuous activities.
- Over-the-counter pain medication, specifically acetaminophen or ibuprofen, is recommended for symptom management.
- A follow-up appointment will be scheduled in 2 weeks to assess the patient's condition further.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient should return to the clinic in 2 weeks for a re-evaluation of his symptoms. In the meantime, if the pain worsens or persists, he should contact the clinic immediately.
