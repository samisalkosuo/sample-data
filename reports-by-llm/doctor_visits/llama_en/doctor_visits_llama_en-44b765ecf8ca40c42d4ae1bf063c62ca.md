Patient Information:
Female, 53 years old

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with complaints of worsening shortness of breath and fatigue over the past week, which have progressively worsened.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient reported a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. She described her symptoms as starting with mild dyspnea on exertion, which gradually increased in severity to moderate shortness of breath at rest. The patient also experienced fatigue, particularly in the morning, which has been accompanied by mild orthopnea. There was no mention of chest pain or palpitations.

Physical Examination Findings:
Given the patient's symptoms and history, a thorough physical examination revealed:

- Vital signs: Blood pressure 160/100 mmHg, heart rate 92 bpm, respiratory rate 24 breaths/min, oxygen saturation 95% on room air.
- Lung exam: Bilateral wheezes and crackles were noted in the lower lung fields.
- Cardiovascular exam: No murmurs or gallops were detected.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
Based on the patient's symptoms, history, and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation with possible cardiac involvement is suspected. The patient's blood pressure is elevated, which may be related to her hypertension and possibly her COPD exacerbation.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient was prescribed:

- Inhaled corticosteroids (fluticasone propionate 500 mcg via nebulizer twice daily)
- Bronchodilator inhaler (albuterol sulfate 2 puffs via metered-dose inhaler as needed for symptoms)
- Oral beta-blocker (metoprolol succinate 50 mg once daily) to manage hypertension
- Oxygen therapy (2 liters per minute via nasal cannula) for at least the next 24 hours

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient is advised to follow up with her primary care physician in two weeks to reassess her symptoms and adjust treatment as needed. She should also schedule a pulmonary function test appointment within the next month.

Severity Level: 3 (Urgent – stable, needs 2+ resources)

Note: The severity level of 3 indicates that the patient's condition requires more than one resource but is still considered stable.
