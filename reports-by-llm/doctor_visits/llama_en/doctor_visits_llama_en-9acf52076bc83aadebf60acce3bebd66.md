**Date:** 13.05.2025
**Location:** Inkoo Clinic
**Patient Information:**
- **Gender:** Male
- **Age:** 14 years old

**Chief Complaint:**
The patient presented with a complaint of progressive difficulty breathing over the past few days, which worsened during physical activity.

**History of Present Illness (HPI):**
The patient reported that he has been experiencing shortness of breath and fatigue for several days. The symptoms started after returning from school on Friday afternoon and have progressively worsened since then. He described his breathing as labored and reported feeling lightheaded during physical activity, such as playing soccer with friends.

**Physical Examination Findings:**
Given the severity level of 1 (Resuscitation â€“ immediate life threat), a thorough and rapid assessment was conducted. The patient's oxygen saturation levels were found to be significantly decreased at 88% on room air. His respiratory rate was elevated at 24 breaths per minute, and his blood pressure was within normal limits. A rapid sequence intubation was performed due to the severity of his symptoms.

**Assessment / Diagnosis:**
The patient's presentation is consistent with acute asthma exacerbation, likely triggered by a viral infection. The low oxygen saturation levels and elevated respiratory rate indicate severe respiratory distress.

**Plan / Treatment:**
- **Medications:** The patient was administered 100% oxygen via non-rebreather mask and received an intravenous dose of salbutamol (albuterol) for bronchodilation.
- **Procedures:** A rapid sequence intubation was performed to secure the airway, followed by administration of a neuromuscular blocking agent to facilitate endotracheal intubation. The patient was then transferred to the intensive care unit for close monitoring and further management.

**Follow-up Instructions:**
The patient will be admitted to the intensive care unit for observation and treatment. A follow-up appointment has been scheduled for 24 hours post-admission to assess the patient's progress and adjust treatment as necessary. The patient's parents have been advised to contact the clinic immediately if they notice any worsening of symptoms or if the patient experiences difficulty breathing.

**Discharge Instructions:**
The patient will require close monitoring in the intensive care unit, with regular assessments of oxygen saturation levels, respiratory rate, and blood pressure. The patient is also advised to avoid strenuous activities until further clearance is obtained from a healthcare provider.
