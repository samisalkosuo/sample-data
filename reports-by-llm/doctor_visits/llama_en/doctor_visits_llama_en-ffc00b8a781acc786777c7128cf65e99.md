**Visit Summary**

**Date:** October 29, 2024
**Location:** Jokioinen Clinic
**Severity Level:** 3 (Urgent)

**Patient Information:**
Male patient, age 100 years.

**Chief Complaint:**
The patient presented with complaints of progressive shortness of breath and fatigue over the past week. He reported feeling increasingly weak and having difficulty performing daily activities due to his respiratory symptoms.

**History of Present Illness (HPI):**
The patient's symptoms began approximately two weeks ago, worsening gradually over time. He experiences shortness of breath upon exertion, which is relieved by rest. The patient also reports coughing up pink, frothy sputum on several occasions. His oxygen saturation levels have been consistently below 90% on room air.

**Physical Examination Findings:**
Given the patient's age and severity level, a thorough physical examination was performed to assess for any underlying conditions contributing to his symptoms. The patient appeared frail with significant weight loss and cachexia. His respiratory rate was elevated at 24 breaths per minute, and his oxygen saturation levels remained below 90% on room air. Bilateral crackles were heard in the lungs bilaterally, consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient's vital signs were as follows: blood pressure 160/80 mmHg, heart rate 110 beats per minute, and temperature 37.5Â°C.

**Assessment / Diagnosis:**
The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with severe COPD exacerbation, likely secondary to chronic bronchitis. The presence of pink, frothy sputum further supports this diagnosis. Given the patient's age and underlying health conditions, it is essential to manage his symptoms aggressively to prevent further decline.

**Plan / Treatment:**
The patient will be started on high-flow nasal cannula therapy with supplemental oxygen at 4-5 liters per minute. He will also receive bronchodilator inhalation therapy twice daily, as prescribed by his primary care physician. The patient's primary care physician will contact the clinic to discuss further management and potential hospitalization.

**Follow-up Instructions:**
The patient is scheduled for follow-up in one week to reassess his condition and adjust treatment as necessary. His primary care physician will also schedule a home visit within the next 48 hours to assess the patient's condition and provide additional guidance on managing his symptoms at home.

**Additional Notes:** Due to the patient's age and severity level, it is essential to closely monitor his condition and be prepared for potential complications such as respiratory failure or cardiac arrhythmias.
