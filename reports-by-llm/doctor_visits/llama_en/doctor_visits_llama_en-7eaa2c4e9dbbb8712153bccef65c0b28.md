Location: Suonenjoki Clinic

Patient Information:
Female patient, age 19 years

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with a complaint of mild abdominal pain and nausea, which she reported had been worsening over the past few days.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient described her symptoms as starting with a dull ache in her lower abdomen, which gradually increased in intensity. She also experienced nausea and vomiting, particularly after meals. The pain was not constant but rather came and went, with episodes lasting several hours at a time. The patient reported no fever, chills, or other systemic symptoms.

Physical Examination Findings:
Given the severity level of 5 (non-urgent), the physical examination was relatively unremarkable. The patient's vital signs were stable, with a blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg, pulse of 72 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. Abdominal tenderness was noted in the lower quadrant, but no guarding or rebound tenderness was present. The rest of the examination was unremarkable.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of mild acute appendicitis was made. The patient's age and presentation were consistent with this diagnosis, although further imaging studies would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient was prescribed a course of antibiotics (amoxicillin-clavulanate) to cover for potential bacterial infection. She was also advised to rest and avoid heavy lifting or strenuous activities. Follow-up appointments would be scheduled in one week to monitor her symptoms and assess the effectiveness of treatment.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient is instructed to follow up with the clinic in one week to reassess her symptoms. If her symptoms worsen or she experiences any signs of sepsis (e.g., fever, chills, rapid heartbeat), she should contact the clinic immediately for further evaluation and potential hospital admission.

It is essential to note that while this report is based on a realistic scenario, it is not intended to be a substitute for actual clinical judgment. In practice, a healthcare provider would need to consider additional factors, such as laboratory results, imaging studies, and patient history, when making a diagnosis and developing a treatment plan.
