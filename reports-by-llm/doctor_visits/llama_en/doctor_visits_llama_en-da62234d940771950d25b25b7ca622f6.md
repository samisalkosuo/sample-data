**Visit Summary**

**Date:** November 12, 2023
**Location:** Enonkoski Clinic
**Severity Level:** 5 (Non-urgent â€“ minor complaints)

**Patient Information:**
Male patient, age 16.

**Chief Complaint:**
The patient presented with a mild rash on his left arm, which he noticed for the first time yesterday. He reported that it started as a small, itchy spot and has since grown in size but remains relatively painless.

**History of Present Illness (HPI):**
The patient described the rash as a red, flat patch with slightly raised edges. It is located on his left forearm, approximately 2 cm in diameter. He mentioned that he had been engaging in moderate physical activity over the past few days and has not experienced any significant discomfort or fever. The rash has been itchy, but he reported using calamine lotion to alleviate symptoms.

**Physical Examination Findings:**
Upon examination, the rash was found to be consistent with the patient's description. It was located on his left forearm, with no signs of infection, such as redness, swelling, or pus. The skin appeared healthy and unaffected elsewhere. No other notable findings were observed during the physical exam.

**Assessment / Diagnosis:**
Based on the patient's presentation and examination findings, a diagnosis of mild dermatitis is suspected. This condition is likely caused by an allergic reaction to an environmental factor, such as pollen or soaps. Given the patient's age and lack of systemic symptoms, this is considered a minor complaint.

**Plan / Treatment:**
The patient will be prescribed a topical corticosteroid cream (0.05% hydrocortisone) to reduce inflammation and itching. He will also be advised to avoid scratching the affected area and use calamine lotion as needed for symptom relief. Follow-up appointments will be scheduled in 2 weeks to monitor the rash's resolution.

**Follow-up Instructions:**
The patient is instructed to return to the clinic in 2 weeks for a follow-up examination. If symptoms worsen or fail to improve, he should contact his primary care physician for further guidance.
