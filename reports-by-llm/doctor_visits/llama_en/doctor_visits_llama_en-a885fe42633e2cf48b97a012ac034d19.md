Visit Summary:

Date: 12.02.2025
Location: Vantaa Clinic

Patient Information:
Female, 54 years old

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with complaints of worsening back pain and recent onset of fatigue.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient reported a gradual increase in back pain over the past few weeks, which has worsened over the past week. She described the pain as a dull ache, primarily located in the lower back, radiating to her buttocks and thighs. The pain is exacerbated by movement and relieved by rest. Additionally, she reported feeling fatigued, with decreased energy levels and difficulty concentrating. These symptoms have been present for approximately 2 weeks.

Physical Examination Findings:
Given the severity level of 5 (non-urgent), the physical examination was relatively unremarkable. The patient's vital signs were within normal limits. The back pain was assessed as tenderness to palpation, with no evidence of muscle spasm or guarding. The neurological examination revealed no abnormalities in sensation, motor function, or reflexes. A thorough abdominal examination did not reveal any significant findings.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of chronic low back pain was made. The fatigue and decreased energy levels are likely related to the underlying back pain. Further evaluation is recommended to rule out any underlying conditions that may be contributing to these symptoms.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient will be prescribed 500mg of ibuprofen twice daily for pain management, as needed. A referral to a specialist (orthopedic) will be made to further evaluate and manage the patient's back pain. The patient is advised to maintain good posture, engage in regular exercise, and avoid heavy lifting or bending.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient should follow up with the orthopedic specialist within 2 weeks for further evaluation and management of her back pain. Additionally, she will be scheduled for a follow-up appointment with our clinic in 6 weeks to reassess her symptoms and adjust treatment as needed.
