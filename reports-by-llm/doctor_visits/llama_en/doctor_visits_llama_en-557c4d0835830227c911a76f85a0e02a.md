Date: June 7, 2024
Location: Jyväskylä Clinic

Patient Information:
Gender: Female
Age: 20 years

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with a 2-day history of worsening fatigue, generalized malaise, and mild fever. She reported feeling unwell since the previous evening, with no specific onset or precipitating factors.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient described her symptoms as gradually increasing in severity over the past two days. Initially, she experienced a low-grade fever (38°C) and general malaise, which worsened throughout the day. She also reported feeling weak and fatigued, with no significant weight loss or changes in appetite. The patient denied any recent travel, exposure to sick individuals, or new medications.

Physical Examination Findings:
Vital signs: Temperature 38.5°C, Blood Pressure 110/70 mmHg, Pulse 90/min, Respiratory Rate 16/min.
General appearance: The patient appeared pale and weak, with no significant abnormalities on visual inspection.
Abdominal examination: No tenderness or guarding was noted.
Lymph nodes were palpable in the neck region.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of viral pharyngitis (common cold) is suspected. The presence of fever, malaise, and lymphadenopathy supports this diagnosis. Given the patient's age and presentation, further testing for streptococcal pharyngitis or other infections is not immediately warranted.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient was prescribed a 5-day course of amoxicillin (500mg orally twice daily) to treat her suspected viral pharyngitis. She was also advised to rest, stay hydrated, and use over-the-counter pain relievers as needed for fever and headache.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient is scheduled for follow-up in two weeks to assess the resolution of symptoms and evaluate for any potential complications. In the meantime, she should continue to take her medication as directed and contact the clinic if her symptoms worsen or do not improve with treatment.

Severity Level: 2 (Emergent – potential life threat)

Note: The patient's symptoms are mild but potentially concerning due to the presence of fever and lymphadenopathy. Close monitoring and follow-up are necessary to ensure resolution of symptoms and prevent potential complications.
