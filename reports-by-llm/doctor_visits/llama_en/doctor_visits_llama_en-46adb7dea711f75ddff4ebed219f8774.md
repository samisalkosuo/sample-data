**Visit Summary**

**Date:** July 10, 2023
**Location:** Siikajoki Clinic
**Patient Information:**
- **Gender:** Female
- **Age:** 94 years old

**Chief Complaint:**
The patient presented with complaints of worsening shortness of breath and fatigue over the past week.

**History of Present Illness (HPI):**
The patient reported a gradual increase in difficulty breathing, particularly during exertion. She also mentioned feeling increasingly fatigued, which has resulted in reduced mobility and decreased appetite. The symptoms began approximately 2 weeks ago and have progressively worsened. There is no history of chest pain or cough.

**Physical Examination Findings:**
Given the patient's age and severity level (1), a thorough assessment was conducted to identify potential life-threatening conditions. Vital signs revealed a blood pressure of 160/90 mmHg, pulse rate of 110 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 92% on room air, and temperature of 37.4°C (99.3°F). The patient appeared anxious but cooperative.

**Assessment / Diagnosis:**
The patient's presentation is concerning for acute heart failure, given the rapid onset of symptoms and signs suggestive of fluid overload (e.g., shortness of breath, fatigue). Further evaluation is necessary to confirm this diagnosis.

**Plan / Treatment:**
- **Medications:** The patient was started on furosemide 40 mg IV every 6 hours as needed for dyspnea and diuretic therapy.
- **Monitoring:** Continuous ECG monitoring and oxygen saturation monitoring were initiated.
- **Procedures:** An echocardiogram is scheduled for the following day to assess cardiac function.

**Follow-up Instructions:**
The patient will be seen in the emergency department at 8 AM on July 11, 2023. The nurse will contact her family member with updated information and instructions regarding medication administration and follow-up care.
