**Visit Summary**

**Date:** September 3, 2024
**Location:** Virolahti Clinic
**Severity Level:** 2 (Emergent â€“ potential life threat)

**Patient Information:**
Female patient, age 13.

**Chief Complaint:**
The patient presented with a 2-day history of worsening abdominal pain and vomiting, accompanied by fever and general malaise. She reported that her symptoms have progressively worsened over the past 24 hours.

**History of Present Illness (HPI):**
The patient's abdominal pain began as mild and was initially managed at home with over-the-counter antacids. However, the pain has since intensified, becoming more severe and localized to the right lower quadrant. She also reports episodes of vomiting, which have led to dehydration. Fever, which started 2 days ago, has been intermittent but persistent. The patient's general malaise and fatigue are significant concerns.

**Physical Examination Findings:**
Given the severity level of this case, a thorough physical examination was conducted with caution. Vital signs revealed tachycardia (heart rate of 120 bpm) and mild dehydration (specific gravity of urine at 1.010). Abdominal tenderness was noted in the right lower quadrant, with guarding present. The patient's abdomen was also slightly distended.

**Assessment / Diagnosis:**
Based on the clinical presentation, a diagnosis of acute appendicitis is highly suspected. This condition requires prompt surgical intervention to prevent complications such as perforation and peritonitis.

**Plan / Treatment:**
The patient will be admitted for immediate surgical evaluation and management. Preoperative fluid resuscitation and broad-spectrum antibiotics will be administered to stabilize the patient before surgery. Postoperatively, pain management with opioids will be initiated, and follow-up appointments will be scheduled to monitor recovery.

**Follow-up Instructions:**
The patient is advised to return to the clinic in 2 weeks for a postoperative follow-up appointment. In the meantime, she should avoid strenuous activities and adhere strictly to her medication regimen as prescribed by her healthcare provider.
