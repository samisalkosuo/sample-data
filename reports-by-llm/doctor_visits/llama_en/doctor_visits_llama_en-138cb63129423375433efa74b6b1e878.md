Visit Summary:

Date: 09.04.2025
Location: Joensuu Clinic

Patient Information:
Gender: Male
Age: 2 years

Chief Complaint:
The patient's mother reported that her 2-year-old son has been experiencing severe respiratory distress, with episodes of apnea and cyanosis, over the past few hours.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The child was brought to the clinic in a state of distress, with rapid breathing rate (40 breaths/min) and decreased oxygen saturation (82% on room air). The mother reported that these symptoms started approximately 2 hours ago, after the child had been playing outside. During this time, the child became increasingly irritable and refused to feed or drink. The patient's temperature is 38.5°C (101.3°F), and the blood pressure is 90/60 mmHg.

Physical Examination Findings:
Given the severity of the symptoms, a high index of suspicion for respiratory distress syndrome was maintained throughout the examination. The child was observed to be in moderate distress, with rapid breathing rate and decreased oxygen saturation. The lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally, but the patient's chest wall was slightly tense. The heart rate is 140 beats/min, and the blood pressure remains stable.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
Based on the clinical presentation, a diagnosis of severe respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) with possible viral etiology was made. The child's symptoms are consistent with a lower respiratory tract infection, possibly caused by a viral agent such as RSV or influenza.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient was administered oxygen via nasal cannula at 5 liters/min and placed on supplemental oxygen therapy in the recovery room. The child received a dose of acetaminophen (15 mg/kg) for fever management and a dose of dexamethasone (0.5 mg/kg) to reduce inflammation. The mother was advised to monitor the patient's oxygen saturation closely and report any further changes in respiratory status.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient will be followed up with an emergency department visit within 2 hours if symptoms worsen or do not improve with treatment. The child is expected to require close monitoring for signs of respiratory failure, including decreased oxygen saturation, increased work of breathing, and bilateral infiltrates on chest radiograph.
