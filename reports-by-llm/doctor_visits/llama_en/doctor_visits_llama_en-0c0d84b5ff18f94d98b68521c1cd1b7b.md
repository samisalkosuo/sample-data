Date: March 11, 2024
Location: Tornio Clinic

Patient Information:
Female patient, age 53

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with complaints of persistent and worsening right-sided shoulder pain, which she described as a dull ache that has been increasing in intensity over the past few weeks. She reported difficulty lifting her arm and performing daily activities due to the discomfort.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient's symptoms began approximately 6 weeks ago, with initial episodes of sharp pain radiating from her shoulder down to her elbow. Over time, the pain has transitioned to a dull ache that is exacerbated by movement and relieved by rest. She reported no recent trauma or injury to the affected area.

Physical Examination Findings:
Given the patient's age and presentation, a thorough physical examination was conducted to assess for any underlying conditions that may be contributing to her symptoms. The right shoulder was found to be tender to palpation, with limited range of motion. No signs of infection, inflammation, or neurological deficits were noted. A radiograph of the affected area was ordered to further evaluate the cause of her symptoms.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
Based on the patient's presentation and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of adhesive capsulitis (frozen shoulder) was made. This condition is characterized by stiffness and pain in the shoulder joint, which can be exacerbated by movement and relieved by rest.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient will undergo further evaluation with radiography to confirm the diagnosis and assess for any underlying conditions that may be contributing to her symptoms. In the meantime, she will be advised to continue with gentle exercises to maintain range of motion and reduce stiffness. A referral to a physical therapist was made to provide additional guidance on managing her condition.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient is scheduled for follow-up in 2 weeks to reassess her symptoms and adjust her treatment plan as needed. She is also advised to contact the clinic if her symptoms worsen or if she experiences any significant increase in pain or stiffness.

Severity Level: 3 (Urgent â€“ stable, needs 2+ resources)

Note: The severity level of 3 indicates that the patient's condition requires additional resources and attention, but is currently stable. Further evaluation and management are necessary to prevent progression of the condition.
