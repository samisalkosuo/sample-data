Visit Summary:

Date: 13.08.2023
Location: Porvoo Clinic

Patient Information:
Gender: Female
Age: 101 years

Severity Level: 4 (Less-urgent â€“ stable, 1 resource)

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with a complaint of progressive shortness of breath and fatigue over the past week, which has worsened over the past few days. She reported feeling increasingly weak and having difficulty performing daily activities.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient's symptoms began approximately 7-10 days ago, with an initial onset of mild dyspnea (shortness of breath) that gradually increased in severity. Over time, she has experienced worsening fatigue, particularly after minimal exertion, and has had to reduce her usual activities due to decreased energy levels. The patient reported no chest pain or cough, but did mention a slight increase in sputum production.

Physical Examination Findings:
Given the patient's advanced age and comorbidities (hypertension, hyperlipidemia), a thorough physical examination was conducted with particular attention to respiratory function. Vital signs were stable, with a blood pressure of 160/90 mmHg, pulse of 80 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. The patient's lungs were clear to auscultation, and there were no signs of congestion or edema. A thorough neurological examination revealed no focal deficits.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
Based on the patient's history and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation was made. The patient's symptoms are consistent with a worsening of her underlying COPD, likely exacerbated by environmental factors such as air pollution in Porvoo.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient will be prescribed a short-course inhaler therapy with bronchodilators and corticosteroids to manage her symptoms. She will also receive oxygen therapy as needed, with the goal of maintaining an oxygen saturation level above 90% on room air. The patient's hypertension and hyperlipidemia will require ongoing management.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient is scheduled for a follow-up appointment in 2 weeks to reassess her symptoms and adjust her treatment plan as necessary. She is advised to continue taking her prescribed medications as directed, and to report any changes in her symptoms or concerns to the healthcare provider promptly.

Additional Recommendations:
Given the patient's advanced age and comorbidities, it is essential that she receives regular follow-up appointments to monitor her condition and adjust her treatment plan accordingly. Additionally, the patient should be educated on proper COPD management techniques, including smoking cessation and avoiding environmental triggers such as air pollution.
