Visit Summary:

Patient Name: Mr. Juhani Kalleinen
Date of Visit: 06.05.2024
Location: Pyhäranta Clinic

Chief Complaint:
Mr. Kalleinen presented with complaints of worsening shortness of breath and fatigue over the past week, which has significantly impacted his daily activities.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient reported that he had been experiencing progressive dyspnea (shortness of breath) and fatigue, particularly after minimal exertion. He also mentioned a recent increase in coughing, producing yellowish sputum. Mr. Kalleinen's symptoms worsened over the past 48 hours, leading him to seek medical attention.

Physical Examination Findings:
Given the patient's age (82 years) and severity level (4), the physical examination was focused on assessing his respiratory status. Vital signs revealed a temperature of 37.5°C, blood pressure 160/90 mmHg, pulse 100 bpm, and oxygen saturation 92% on room air. The lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally. The patient's chest X-ray showed bilateral infiltrates consistent with pneumonia.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
Based on the patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, and laboratory results (not provided), a diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia was made. The patient's age and comorbidities (hypertension, hyperlipidemia) also contributed to his increased risk for complications.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient was started on antibiotics (amoxicillin-clavulanate 500mg twice daily) and oxygen therapy (2L/min via nasal cannula). He was also advised to rest, stay hydrated, and avoid strenuous activities. A follow-up appointment is scheduled for 3 days from today.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient should return to the clinic on 08.05.2024 at 10:00 AM for a follow-up evaluation. In the meantime, he should continue taking his medications as prescribed and monitor his oxygen saturation levels closely. If his symptoms worsen or he experiences any signs of respiratory distress (e.g., chest pain, difficulty breathing), he should contact the clinic immediately.

Discharge Instructions:
The patient was advised to avoid close contact with others to prevent the spread of infection. He should also report any changes in his symptoms or concerns to the healthcare provider promptly.
