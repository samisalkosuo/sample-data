**Date:** 13.03.2024
**Location:** Sysmä Clinic
**Severity Level:** 2 (Emergent – potential life threat)

**Patient Information:**
- **Gender:** Male
- **Age:** 68 years old

**Chief Complaint:**
The patient presented with a 2-day history of progressive dyspnea, orthopnea, and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. He reported feeling short of breath at rest and experiencing worsening symptoms over the past 24 hours.

**History of Present Illness (HPI):**
The patient's symptoms began approximately 48 hours ago, with an initial onset of mild dyspnea that gradually worsened. He described his breathing as labored and reported orthopnea, where he feels the need to sit upright to alleviate shortness of breath. Noturnal episodes of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea have also occurred, leaving him feeling gasping for air upon waking. The patient's oxygen saturation levels were consistently below 90% on room air.

**Physical Examination Findings:**
Upon examination, the patient exhibited signs consistent with heart failure, including jugular venous distension (JVD) and bilateral rales. His respiratory rate was elevated at 24 breaths per minute, and his blood pressure was 140/80 mmHg. The patient's oxygen saturation levels remained below 90% on room air.

**Assessment / Diagnosis:**
Based on the patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, and laboratory results (not provided), a diagnosis of acute decompensated heart failure is suspected. Further testing, including echocardiogram and troponin levels, will be ordered to confirm this diagnosis.

**Plan / Treatment:**
The patient was started on intravenous furosemide 40 mg IV q 6 hours and nitroglycerin 3 mg IV SL q 5 minutes as needed for angina. Oxygen therapy was initiated with a nasal cannula at 4 liters per minute, and supplemental oxygen was provided as needed to maintain an oxygen saturation level above 90%. The patient will be closely monitored for signs of worsening heart failure or cardiac arrhythmias.

**Follow-up Instructions:**
The patient is scheduled for follow-up in 24 hours to reassess his condition and adjust treatment as necessary. He should return to the clinic with any changes in symptoms, such as increased shortness of breath, chest pain, or swelling.
