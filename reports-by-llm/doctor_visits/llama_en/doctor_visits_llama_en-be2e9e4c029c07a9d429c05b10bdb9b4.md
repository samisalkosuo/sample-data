**Visit Summary**

**Date:** 15.07.2025
**Location:** Sonkajärvi Clinic
**Severity Level:** 3 (Urgent – stable, needs 2+ resources)

**Patient Information:**
- **Gender:** Male
- **Age:** 25 years old

**Chief Complaint:**
The patient presented with a complaint of worsening back pain radiating to the left leg, accompanied by progressive numbness and tingling in the lower extremities. He reported difficulty walking due to severe pain and limited mobility.

**History of Present Illness (HPI):**
The patient's symptoms began 2 weeks ago after an episode of acute trauma during a sports injury. Initially, he experienced localized pain but gradually worsened over time, with increasing numbness and weakness in the affected leg. He reported no recent fever, chills, or other systemic symptoms.

**Physical Examination Findings:**
Given the severity level of 3 (Urgent), the physical examination was conducted with caution to avoid exacerbating the patient's condition. The patient presented with significant tenderness and swelling along the left lower extremity, particularly in the posterior aspect of the thigh. Muscle strength was decreased in the affected leg, with notable weakness in plantarflexion. Sensory examination revealed diminished sensation in the lateral aspect of the foot.

**Assessment / Diagnosis:**
The clinical presentation is suggestive of a post-traumatic sciatic nerve injury, likely resulting from the acute trauma sustained during the sports injury. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with this diagnosis.

**Plan / Treatment:**
- **Medications:** The patient will be prescribed 500mg of ibuprofen orally twice daily for pain management.
- **Procedures:** An ultrasound-guided corticosteroid injection into the affected nerve sheath is recommended to reduce inflammation and promote healing. This procedure will be performed by an interventional radiologist within the next 48 hours.
- **Follow-up Instructions:** The patient is scheduled for a follow-up appointment in 2 weeks to assess the efficacy of treatment and plan further management as needed.

**Follow-up Instructions:**
The patient should return for a follow-up appointment on [insert date, two weeks from the current visit]. During this visit, we will reassess the patient's symptoms and adjust treatment as necessary. The patient is advised to maintain a regular exercise routine, including stretching exercises to promote healing and prevent further injury.

**Additional Instructions:**
The patient should avoid heavy lifting, bending, or strenuous activities until further notice. He is also advised to report any worsening symptoms or new neurological deficits promptly.
