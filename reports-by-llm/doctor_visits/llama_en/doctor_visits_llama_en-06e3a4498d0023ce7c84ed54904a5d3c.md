**Visit Summary**

**Date:** 15.05.2025
**Location:** Kerava Clinic
**Severity Level:** 4 (Less-urgent – stable, 1 resource)

**Patient Information:**
Male patient, aged 97 years.

**Chief Complaint:**
The patient reported experiencing difficulty breathing and a persistent cough for the past week, which has worsened over the past few days. He also mentioned feeling fatigued and having a low-grade fever of 38.5°C.

**History of Present Illness (HPI):**
The patient's symptoms began approximately one week ago, with an initial episode of severe shortness of breath that required him to sit upright in bed. Since then, his condition has progressively worsened, with increasing difficulty breathing and a persistent cough productive of yellowish sputum. The patient reports feeling increasingly fatigued, which has affected his ability to perform daily activities. His fever has been relatively stable at 38.5°C.

**Physical Examination Findings:**
Given the patient's age and severity level, a thorough physical examination was performed with caution to avoid exacerbating any potential respiratory compromise. The patient appeared anxious but calm, with a temperature of 38.5°C, blood pressure 140/80 mmHg, and oxygen saturation 92% on room air. Lung sounds were bilaterally clear, with no signs of consolidation or wheezing. The patient's cardiovascular system was stable, with normal heart rate and rhythm. A thorough examination of the neck revealed no lymphadenopathy.

**Assessment / Diagnosis:**
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation is suspected. The patient's age and history of smoking are consistent with this diagnosis. Further testing, including a chest X-ray and possibly a CT scan, may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.

**Plan / Treatment:**
The patient will be started on oral corticosteroids 40 mg daily for 5 days, followed by a tapering course over the next 2 weeks. He will also receive oxygen therapy as needed, with an initial flow rate of 4 liters per minute. The patient's medication list will be reviewed to ensure that he is not taking any medications that may exacerbate his respiratory condition.

**Follow-up Instructions:**
The patient will be scheduled for a follow-up appointment in 2 weeks to assess the effectiveness of treatment and monitor for any signs of worsening symptoms. In the meantime, the patient should continue to take his prescribed medication as directed and contact the clinic if he experiences any increase in shortness of breath or coughing.

**Additional Instructions:**
The patient's family members will be educated on basic life support techniques, including CPR and oxygen administration. The patient will also receive a list of emergency contact numbers, including the clinic and local ambulance services.
