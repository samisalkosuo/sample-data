Visit Summary:

Date: October 13, 2024
Location: Lepp√§virta Clinic

Patient Information:
Male, 45 years old

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with complaints of worsening back pain and fatigue over the past few weeks.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient reported a gradual increase in back pain, primarily located in the lower lumbar region, which has worsened over time. He also experiences fatigue, particularly after physical activity, and reports difficulty sleeping due to discomfort. The patient denies any recent trauma or significant weight loss. Onset of symptoms began approximately 6 weeks ago.

Physical Examination Findings:
Given the severity level of 3 (Urgent), the patient's physical examination revealed tenderness in the lower lumbar region with moderate stiffness, particularly upon extension. Muscle mass appears relatively preserved, but there is a noticeable decrease in range of motion. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg and a pulse rate of 80 beats per minute.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
The patient's presentation is suggestive of chronic lower back pain, potentially exacerbated by overuse or underlying musculoskeletal issues. Further diagnostic testing may be necessary to rule out other potential causes, such as disc herniation or spinal stenosis.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient will undergo a series of diagnostic tests, including an MRI scan of the lumbar spine and possibly blood work to assess for inflammatory markers. In the meantime, the patient is advised to continue with over-the-counter pain management medication (e.g., ibuprofen) as directed by the pharmacist. A referral to a specialist for further evaluation and potential intervention will be made.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient is scheduled for follow-up in 2 weeks to reassess symptoms and adjust treatment plan as necessary. In the meantime, it is essential that the patient adheres to the prescribed medication regimen and reports any changes in symptoms or pain levels promptly.

Discharge Summary:

The patient was discharged with a prescription for over-the-counter pain management medication and instructions for follow-up appointments.
