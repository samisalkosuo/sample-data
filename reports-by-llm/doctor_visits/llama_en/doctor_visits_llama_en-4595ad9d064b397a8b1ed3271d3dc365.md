The patient presented with a complaint of progressive left-sided chest pain radiating to the back, which worsened over the past two days.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
Mr. Kukkiaho reported that he had been experiencing intermittent chest discomfort for several weeks, but it intensified in the past 48 hours. He described the pain as sharp and stabbing, often worsening with deep breathing or movement. The patient also mentioned a recent increase in shortness of breath, particularly during exertion. He denied any fever, cough, or sputum production.

Physical Examination Findings:
Given the severity level of 4, the physical examination was focused on assessing cardiovascular stability and potential respiratory compromise. Vital signs were within normal limits (BP 140/90 mmHg, HR 80 bpm, SpO2 98%). The patient's oxygen saturation remained stable during the visit. Cardiac examination revealed a regular rhythm with no murmurs or gallops. Lung exam was clear bilaterally. The patient exhibited mild distress but was able to converse comfortably.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) was made. Further evaluation suggested possible myocardial infarction (MI), given the patient's ECG results showing ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, and aVL.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient was started on aspirin 81 mg PO daily, clopidogrel 75 mg PO daily, and metoprolol succinate 50 mg PO twice daily. He was also prescribed beta blockers to manage pain and reduce cardiac workload. The patient was advised to avoid heavy lifting, bending, or strenuous activities for the next two weeks.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient is scheduled for a follow-up appointment in one week to reassess his condition and adjust medication as needed. It is essential that he adheres to his medication regimen and attends all scheduled appointments. The patient's family members were educated on recognizing signs of cardiac complications, such as chest pain radiating to the arm or back, shortness of breath, and fatigue.

Discharge Instructions:
The patient was advised to seek immediate medical attention if he experiences any of the following: worsening chest pain, difficulty breathing, dizziness, or fainting. He should also contact his healthcare provider if he has any questions or concerns about his treatment plan.
