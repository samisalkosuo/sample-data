Visit Summary:

Patient Name: Juhani K., Male
Age: 101 years
Date of Visit: January 10, 2023
Location: Savonlinna Clinic

Chief Complaint:
Mr. K. presented with complaints of progressive shortness of breath and fatigue over the past few weeks. He reported feeling increasingly weak and having difficulty performing daily activities.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient's symptoms began approximately 6 weeks ago, with a gradual increase in severity. Mr. K. described his breathing as labored, even at rest, and reported experiencing orthopnea (shortness of breath while lying down). He also mentioned feeling cold intolerance and having difficulty maintaining a normal body temperature. The patient's fatigue worsened over time, making it challenging for him to perform daily activities such as bathing and dressing.

Physical Examination Findings:
Given the patient's advanced age and severity level 2, the physical examination was focused on assessing his respiratory status and overall well-being. Vital signs revealed a blood pressure of 160/90 mmHg, pulse rate of 100 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on room air. The patient appeared frail and weak, with significant weight loss (20 kg over the past year). Lung sounds were clear bilaterally, but there was a noticeable decrease in breath sounds at the bases. The patient's skin was pale and cool to the touch.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, Mr. K. was diagnosed with advanced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation. The patient's age and comorbidities (e.g., hypertension, hyperlipidemia) also contributed to his overall clinical picture.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient was started on oxygen therapy via nasal cannula, with a flow rate of 4 liters per minute. He was prescribed oral corticosteroids (prednisone 40 mg daily) for 7-10 days to reduce inflammation and improve lung function. The patient was also advised to use a humidifier in his home to help manage his respiratory symptoms. Additional recommendations included increasing fluid intake, using a walking aid for mobility support, and scheduling follow-up appointments with the primary care physician.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient is scheduled to follow up with his primary care physician in 2 weeks to reassess his condition and adjust treatment as needed. The patient's family members were advised to monitor his oxygen saturation levels and report any changes or concerns to the healthcare provider.
