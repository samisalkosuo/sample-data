**Visit Summary**

**Date:** 23.07.2024
**Location:** Sysmä Clinic
**Severity Level:** 4 (Less-urgent – stable, 1 resource)

**Patient Information:**
Male patient, age 88.

**Chief Complaint:**
The patient presented with complaints of worsening shortness of breath and fatigue over the past week, which have significantly impacted his daily activities.

**History of Present Illness (HPI):**
The patient reported a gradual increase in dyspnea (shortness of breath) and fatigue, particularly after minimal exertion. He also mentioned an inability to perform his usual activities without feeling winded. The symptoms worsened over the past week, with the patient experiencing more pronounced shortness of breath during rest periods. There was no recent travel or exposure to potential infections.

**Physical Examination Findings:**
Given the patient's age and severity level, a thorough physical examination was conducted to assess for any underlying conditions contributing to his symptoms. The patient appeared frail but alert, with vital signs within normal limits (BP 140/90 mmHg, HR 80 bpm, RR 16 breaths/min). Oxygen saturation was 95% on room air. Lung sounds were clear bilaterally, and the patient's extremities were cool to the touch.

**Assessment / Diagnosis:**
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation is suspected. The patient's age and history of smoking are consistent with this diagnosis. Further testing, such as a chest X-ray or spirometry, may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.

**Plan / Treatment:**
The patient will be prescribed a short-course inhaler therapy with bronchodilators (e.g., albuterol) to alleviate symptoms and improve lung function. He will also receive oxygen therapy as needed to maintain adequate oxygen saturation levels. The patient's primary care physician will discuss the importance of smoking cessation and pulmonary rehabilitation programs.

**Follow-up Instructions:**
The patient is scheduled for a follow-up appointment in 2 weeks to reassess his condition and adjust treatment as necessary. In the meantime, he should continue to use his inhaler therapy as directed and report any changes in symptoms or worsening shortness of breath to his primary care physician.
