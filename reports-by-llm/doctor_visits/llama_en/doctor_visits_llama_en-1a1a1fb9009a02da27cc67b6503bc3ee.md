**Visit Summary**

**Date:** August 30, 2023
**Location:** Laukaa Clinic
**Severity Level:** 4

**Patient Information:**
- **Gender:** Female
- **Age:** 57 years old

**Chief Complaint:**
The patient presented with complaints of progressive left-sided chest pain radiating to the back, accompanied by shortness of breath and fatigue over the past two weeks.

**History of Present Illness (HPI):**
The patient reported a gradual increase in symptoms starting from two weeks ago. Initially, she experienced mild discomfort while walking up stairs, which worsened over time. She also noticed an increase in shortness of breath during exertion and at rest. The pain is described as sharp and stabbing, often worsening with deep breathing or movement.

The patient mentioned that her symptoms have not significantly improved despite resting and avoiding strenuous activities. She has been experiencing occasional coughing fits, which seem to be related to the chest pain. There are no fever, chills, or other systemic symptoms reported.

**Physical Examination Findings:**
Given the severity level of 4, a thorough physical examination was conducted with emphasis on cardiovascular and respiratory systems. The patient's vital signs were stable at the time of examination (blood pressure 140/90 mmHg, heart rate 80 bpm, oxygen saturation 98% on room air).

The left sternal border was tender to palpation, indicating possible myocardial ischemia or infarction. Auscultation revealed a harsh, mid-to-late pulmonary ejection sound at the apex, suggestive of mitral regurgitation. The lungs were clear bilaterally with no wheezing or crackles.

**Assessment / Diagnosis:**
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is suspected. Further diagnostic testing, including an electrocardiogram (ECG), troponin levels, and possibly echocardiography, will be necessary to confirm this suspicion and assess for potential complications.

**Plan / Treatment:**
The patient was started on aspirin 81 mg daily, clopidogrel 75 mg once daily, and metoprolol succinate 50 mg twice daily. She is also advised to take nitroglycerin sublingually as needed for chest pain relief. The patient will be scheduled for an urgent echocardiogram within the next 24 hours.

**Follow-up Instructions:**
The patient is instructed to follow up with the cardiology department in two weeks for further evaluation and management of her condition. She should also schedule a follow-up appointment with her primary care physician in one week to monitor her medication regimen and adjust as necessary. The patient is advised to contact the clinic immediately if she experiences worsening chest pain, shortness of breath, or any other concerning symptoms.

**Additional Notes:**
The patient's family members were informed about her condition and advised on how to manage her symptoms at home. A referral for a cardiologist will be made as soon as possible.
