Location: Kangasniemi Clinic

Patient Information:
Male patient, aged 73 years

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with complaints of progressive difficulty breathing and fatigue over the past week.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient reported a gradual worsening of shortness of breath, particularly during exertion. He also experienced fatigue, which has been persistent and increasing in severity. The patient denied any recent travel or exposure to potential infectious agents. His symptoms worsened over the past few days, leading him to seek medical attention.

Physical Examination Findings:
Given the patient's age and severity level (5), a thorough physical examination was conducted with caution to avoid exacerbating his condition. Vital signs were stable, but oxygen saturation was 92% on room air. The patient's lungs were clear to auscultation, and there were no signs of consolidation or edema. Cardiovascular examination revealed a normal heart rate and blood pressure. Neurological examination was also unremarkable.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation was made. The patient's age and severity level suggest that this is an acute decompensated COPD episode requiring close monitoring and oxygen therapy.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient was started on supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula at 4 L/min, with a target saturation of 88-92%. He was also prescribed oral corticosteroids (prednisone) 40 mg daily for 5 days to reduce inflammation. The patient's inhaler regimen was reviewed and adjusted as necessary.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient is scheduled for follow-up in 2 weeks to reassess his condition and adjust treatment as needed. He is advised to continue using his inhalers as prescribed and to monitor his oxygen saturation levels closely. If his symptoms worsen or he experiences any increase in shortness of breath, he should contact the clinic immediately.

Discharge Instructions:
The patient was discharged with a list of emergency contact numbers, including the clinic's after-hours number. He was also provided with information on local resources for COPD management and support groups.
