Patient Information:
- Gender: Male
- Age: 40 years

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with complaints of progressive difficulty breathing, which worsened over the past few hours.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient reported a gradual increase in shortness of breath, starting from mild exertional dyspnea that escalated to severe, non-productive coughing. He described feeling increasingly fatigued and experiencing chest discomfort during physical activity. The symptoms began approximately 24 hours ago and have progressively worsened.

Physical Examination Findings:
Given the severity level of this case (Severity Level: 1), the patient's presentation warrants immediate attention due to potential life-threatening respiratory compromise. Vital signs revealed a blood pressure of 90/60 mmHg, pulse rate of 110 beats per minute, oxygen saturation of 92% on room air, and respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute. The physical examination was notable for bilateral wheezes and decreased lung sounds bilaterally.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
The patient's symptoms and signs are consistent with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) complicated by possible pneumonia. Further diagnostic testing, including a chest X-ray and possibly arterial blood gas analysis, is recommended to confirm the diagnosis and assess the severity of respiratory compromise.

Plan / Treatment:
- The patient was administered oxygen via nasal cannula at 4 liters per minute.
- A prescription for antibiotics (amoxicillin-clavulanate) was issued based on clinical suspicion of pneumonia.
- The patient was advised to continue his current medication regimen, including bronchodilators and inhalers as prescribed by his primary care physician.
- Further evaluation with a pulmonologist is recommended due to the severity of symptoms.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient should follow up with the emergency department within 24 hours for further assessment and possible admission. The patient's primary care physician will contact him to schedule an appointment for a more detailed evaluation once the acute respiratory compromise has been stabilized.
