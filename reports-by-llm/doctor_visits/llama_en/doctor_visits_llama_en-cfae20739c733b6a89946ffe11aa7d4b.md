**Date:** 19.06.2024
**Location:** Suomussalmi Clinic

**Patient Information:**
- **Gender:** Male
- **Age:** 28 years old

**Chief Complaint:**
The patient presented with a complaint of persistent, worsening back pain radiating to the left lower quadrant, accompanied by fever and chills. He reported difficulty sleeping due to discomfort.

**History of Present Illness (HPI):**
The patient described his symptoms as starting approximately two weeks ago, initially presenting with mild stiffness and discomfort in the lower back. Over time, the pain has intensified, becoming more severe and localized to the left side. The pain is exacerbated by movement and relieved by rest. He also reports experiencing fever (38°C) and chills over the past 48 hours.

**Physical Examination Findings:**
Given the severity level of 5, a thorough physical examination was conducted with caution to avoid exacerbating the patient's condition. The patient presented with tenderness in the left lower quadrant, particularly upon palpation. No significant abnormalities were noted on abdominal examination. Vital signs revealed fever (38°C), tachycardia (110 bpm), and mild hypotension (90/60 mmHg). The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.

**Assessment / Diagnosis:**
Based on the patient's symptoms, history, and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of acute appendicitis is suspected. Given the severity level, immediate surgical intervention is required to prevent complications such as perforation or abscess formation.

**Plan / Treatment:**
The patient was immediately taken for emergency surgery under general anesthesia. Post-operative care will involve pain management with intravenous opioids and monitoring for signs of infection or complications. The patient will be admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for close observation and post-operative care.

**Follow-up Instructions:**
The patient is scheduled for follow-up in one week to assess recovery from surgery and remove any sutures or staples. A follow-up appointment with a primary care physician will also be arranged at that time to discuss further management of the patient's condition, including potential long-term complications related to appendicitis.

**Additional Notes:**
The patient was treated promptly for acute appendicitis, which is expected to improve his prognosis significantly. Close monitoring and post-operative care are crucial in preventing complications and ensuring optimal recovery.
