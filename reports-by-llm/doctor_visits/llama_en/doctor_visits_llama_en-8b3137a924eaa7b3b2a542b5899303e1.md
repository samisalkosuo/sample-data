**Visit Summary**

**Date:** September 6, 2025
**Location:** Pyhäntä Clinic
**Severity Level:** 3 (Urgent - stable, needs 2+ resources)

**Patient Information:**
Female patient, age 99 years.

**Chief Complaint:**
The patient presented with complaints of progressive shortness of breath and fatigue over the past week. She reported feeling increasingly weak and having difficulty performing daily activities due to her respiratory symptoms.

**History of Present Illness (HPI):**
The patient's symptoms began approximately two weeks ago, worsening gradually over time. She has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and has been experiencing increasing shortness of breath with minimal exertion. The patient also reported coughing up yellow sputum on several occasions. Her oxygen saturation levels have been consistently below 90% on room air.

**Physical Examination Findings:**
Given the patient's age and severity level, a thorough physical examination was performed to assess for any underlying conditions contributing to her symptoms. The patient appeared frail and weak, with significant weight loss noted. Her respiratory rate was elevated at 24 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation levels remained below 90% on room air. Bilateral crackles were heard in the lungs, consistent with COPD exacerbation.

**Assessment / Diagnosis:**
Based on the patient's history, physical examination findings, and severity level, a diagnosis of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) was made. The patient requires oxygen therapy to improve her oxygen saturation levels and manage her symptoms.

**Plan / Treatment:**
The patient will be started on supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula at 4 liters per minute. She will also receive a prescription for oral corticosteroids (prednisone) 40 mg daily for 7-10 days to reduce inflammation in the lungs. The patient's COPD medication regimen will be adjusted as needed to optimize her symptoms.

**Follow-up Instructions:**
The patient is scheduled for follow-up with our pulmonary medicine team in two weeks to reassess her condition and adjust her treatment plan as necessary. She should return to the clinic if she experiences any worsening of her symptoms, such as increased shortness of breath or coughing up blood.
