Location: Laihia Clinic

Patient Information:
Male, 88 years old

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with complaints of worsening shortness of breath and fatigue over the past week.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient reported a gradual increase in dyspnea, particularly during exertion, which has worsened over the past week. He also experienced increased fatigue, described as feeling "tired all the time." The patient denied any chest pain or coughing up blood. His oxygen saturation levels have been consistently below 90% on room air.

Physical Examination Findings:
Given the patient's age and severity of symptoms, a thorough physical examination was performed to assess for potential underlying causes. Vital signs revealed a heart rate of 110 bpm, blood pressure 160/80 mmHg, and respiratory rate 24 breaths/min. Oxygen saturation levels were 88% on room air. The patient appeared anxious but cooperative during the examination.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) was made. The patient's age and comorbidities suggest that this may be related to chronic coronary artery disease.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient was started on oxygen therapy via nasal cannula with a flow rate of 4 liters/minute to improve oxygen saturation levels. He was also prescribed furosemide 40 mg orally twice daily for symptomatic relief and diuretic effect. Additionally, the patient was ordered to take aspirin 81 mg orally once daily for secondary prevention of cardiovascular events.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient is scheduled for follow-up in one week to reassess his symptoms and adjust treatment as needed. The nurse will also provide education on managing heart failure, including monitoring for signs of worsening symptoms and adhering to medication regimens.

Severity Level: 3 (Urgent)
