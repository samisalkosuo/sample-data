Date: 30.07.2024
Location: Lepp√§virta Clinic

Patient Information:
Gender: Female
Age: 82 years

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with complaints of worsening shortness of breath and fatigue over the past week, which has significantly impacted her daily activities.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient reported that she has been experiencing progressive dyspnea (shortness of breath) and generalized fatigue, particularly after minimal exertion. These symptoms have worsened over the past week, with a notable increase in severity over the past 48 hours. The patient also reports feeling weak and lacking energy, which has resulted in her being unable to perform daily tasks without rest.

Physical Examination Findings:
Given the patient's age and severity level (3), a thorough physical examination was conducted to assess for any underlying causes of her symptoms. Vital signs were within normal limits, with a blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg and an oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. The patient's lungs were clear to auscultation, and there were no signs of congestion or edema. However, the patient did exhibit significant weakness in her upper extremities, which was consistent with her reported fatigue.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of chronic heart failure (CHF) exacerbation is suspected. The patient's age and comorbidities also suggest possible left ventricular dysfunction, which may be contributing to her symptoms.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient was started on 25 mg of spironolactone daily for its diuretic effects and to reduce blood pressure. Additionally, the patient will receive oxygen therapy as needed to maintain an oxygen saturation of 90% or higher. The patient's physician will also schedule a follow-up appointment in one week to reassess her symptoms and adjust treatment as necessary.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient is advised to follow up with her physician in one week to assess for any improvement in her symptoms. In the meantime, she should continue to rest and avoid strenuous activities. The patient's family members are also encouraged to monitor her oxygen saturation levels closely and seek immediate medical attention if they notice any signs of worsening shortness of breath or chest pain.

Discharge Instructions:
The patient will be discharged with a prescription for spironolactone, oxygen therapy, and follow-up appointments as scheduled.
