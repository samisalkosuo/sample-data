**Severity Level:** 2 (Emergent – potential life threat)

**Patient Information:**
- **Gender:** Female
- **Age:** 37 years old

**Chief Complaint:**
The patient presented with a 2-day history of worsening left lower quadrant abdominal pain, accompanied by nausea and vomiting. She reported that the pain has increased in intensity over the past 24 hours.

**History of Present Illness (HPI):**
The patient described her symptoms as starting with mild discomfort, which gradually worsened to a sharp, stabbing pain. The pain is localized to the left lower quadrant and radiates to the back. She also reported experiencing nausea and vomiting, which have been present for 2 days. The patient has not experienced any fever or changes in bowel habits.

**Physical Examination Findings:**
Upon examination, the patient exhibited tenderness in the left lower quadrant, with guarding (muscle tension) noted upon palpation. The abdomen was soft and non-tender to percussion. The patient's vital signs were stable, with a blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg, heart rate of 90 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air.

**Assessment / Diagnosis:**
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of acute appendicitis is suspected. The severity level of 2 indicates that while the patient is not in immediate life-threatening danger, her condition requires prompt attention to prevent complications.

**Plan / Treatment:**
The patient will be admitted for observation and treatment. She will receive intravenous fluids and antibiotics to manage pain and prevent infection. A surgical consultation will be obtained to discuss the possibility of appendectomy.

**Follow-up Instructions:**
The patient is scheduled for follow-up in 24 hours to reassess her condition and determine if surgery is necessary. In the meantime, she should continue to rest and avoid strenuous activities. The patient's family member or caregiver should contact the clinic if the patient's symptoms worsen or if they experience any signs of sepsis (e.g., fever above 101.5°F, tachycardia, or shortness of breath).

**Additional Notes:**
The patient will be monitored closely for signs of complications, including abscess formation or perforation. The surgical team will discuss the best course of action with the patient and her family member/caregiver upon admission.
