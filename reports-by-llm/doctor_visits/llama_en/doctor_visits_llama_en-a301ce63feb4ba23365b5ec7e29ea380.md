Location: Askola Clinic

Patient Information:
- Gender: Male
- Age: 45 years

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with complaints of progressive left-sided chest pain radiating to the back, accompanied by shortness of breath and fatigue over the past two weeks.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient reported a gradual increase in symptoms, starting with mild discomfort that worsened over time. He described the pain as sharp and stabbing, often worsening with deep breathing or movement. The patient also mentioned experiencing occasional coughing fits, which were relieved by antitussive medication. Initially, he attributed his symptoms to stress but became increasingly concerned due to the persistent nature of his complaints.

Physical Examination Findings:
Given the severity level of 2 (Emergent – potential life threat), a thorough physical examination was conducted with emphasis on cardiovascular and respiratory systems. The patient presented with a slightly elevated temperature (38.5°C) and a normal blood pressure reading (140/90 mmHg). His oxygen saturation levels were within normal limits, but he exhibited signs of mild distress during the examination. A chest X-ray was ordered to assess for any pulmonary complications.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
The patient's symptoms are suggestive of an acute coronary syndrome (ACS), specifically unstable angina. The elevated temperature and shortness of breath further support this diagnosis. Given his age and risk factors, a cardiac catheterization is recommended to evaluate the coronary arteries and determine the best course of treatment.

Plan / Treatment:
- The patient was started on aspirin 81mg daily for its antiplatelet effects.
- A beta-blocker (metoprolol succinate) was initiated at a dose of 50mg twice daily to reduce myocardial oxygen demand.
- An angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (lisinopril) was prescribed at a dose of 10mg once daily to reduce blood pressure and decrease cardiac workload.
- The patient was advised to avoid heavy lifting, bending, or strenuous activities for the next two weeks.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient is scheduled for follow-up in one week to reassess his condition. He should return to the clinic if he experiences worsening chest pain, shortness of breath, or any signs of cardiac instability. Additionally, the patient was advised to contact the clinic immediately if he experiences any symptoms of a heart attack (severe chest pain radiating to the arm, jaw, neck, or back).

The patient's condition is being closely monitored due to its potential life-threatening nature.
