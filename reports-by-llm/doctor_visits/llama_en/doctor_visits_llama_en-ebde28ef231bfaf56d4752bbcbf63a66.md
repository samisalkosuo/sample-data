Date: 24.12.2024
Location: Loimaa Clinic

Patient Information:
- Gender: Female
- Age: 92 years

Severity Level: 2 (Emergent â€“ potential life threat)

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with difficulty breathing and a feeling of impending doom, which she described as "I can't catch my breath." She reported that these symptoms started approximately 30 minutes ago.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient's daughter reported that her mother had been experiencing increasing shortness of breath over the past few days. The patient denied any recent travel or exposure to new environments, and she did not report any fever or chills. She mentioned that she has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and is currently taking inhalers as prescribed.

Physical Examination Findings:
Upon examination, the patient was found to be in moderate distress, with an oxygen saturation level of 88% on room air. Her respiratory rate was elevated at 24 breaths per minute, and her blood pressure was 160/90 mmHg. The lungs were clear to auscultation, but there was a notable decrease in the patient's ability to speak in full sentences due to shortness of breath.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
Given the patient's history of COPD and current symptoms, it is likely that she is experiencing an exacerbation of her chronic condition. The elevated respiratory rate and decreased oxygen saturation suggest that she may require supplemental oxygen therapy. Further evaluation is needed to determine if this is a simple exacerbation or if there are any underlying complications.

Plan / Treatment:
- Order a chest X-ray to rule out any pulmonary embolism or other acute conditions.
- Prescribe 2 liters of supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula and titrate as needed.
- Continue the patient on her current inhaler regimen, with close monitoring for any signs of worsening symptoms.
- Schedule an urgent follow-up appointment for the next day to reassess the patient's condition.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient is advised to return to the clinic at 8:00 AM on 25.12.2024 for further evaluation and management. The daughter should contact the clinic immediately if her mother's symptoms worsen or if she experiences any chest pain, severe shortness of breath, or difficulty speaking.

Discharge Instructions:
The patient is advised to rest and avoid strenuous activities until further notice. She should also avoid exposure to smoke and other irritants that may exacerbate her respiratory condition.
