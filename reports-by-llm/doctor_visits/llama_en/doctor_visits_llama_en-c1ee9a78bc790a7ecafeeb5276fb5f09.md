**Patient Information:**
Female patient, age 19.

**Chief Complaint:**
The patient presented with a 2-day history of mild abdominal pain and nausea. She reported that the pain is intermittent and worsens after eating fatty foods.

**History of Present Illness (HPI):**
The patient described her symptoms as starting 48 hours ago, with the pain initially being more pronounced in the evening. Over time, the pain has become less severe, but she continues to experience nausea, particularly after meals. She denied any vomiting or fever. The patient reported that she has been experiencing mild bloating and discomfort.

**Physical Examination Findings:**
Upon examination, the patient appeared stable and alert. Her vital signs were within normal limits (blood pressure 120/80 mmHg, heart rate 72 bpm, respiratory rate 12 breaths/min). Abdominal examination revealed tenderness in the lower right quadrant, but no guarding or rebound tenderness. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.

**Assessment / Diagnosis:**
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of mild acute appendicitis is suspected. The severity level of 4 indicates that while the patient's condition is less urgent, it still requires attention to prevent potential complications.

**Plan / Treatment:**
The patient will be prescribed oral antibiotics (amoxicillin-clavulanate) for 7-10 days to treat any bacterial infection. She will also receive dietary advice to avoid fatty foods and maintain a balanced diet. The patient is advised to follow up with the clinic in 2 weeks to monitor her condition.

**Follow-up Instructions:**
The patient should return to the clinic on August 17, 2025, for a follow-up appointment. In the meantime, she should contact the clinic if her symptoms worsen or if she experiences any signs of sepsis (e.g., fever, chills, abdominal tenderness).
