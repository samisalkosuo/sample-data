Patient Summary:

Patient Name: [Redacted]
Gender: Female
Age: 70

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with complaints of worsening shortness of breath and fatigue over the past few weeks.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient reported a gradual increase in symptoms, starting with mild exertional dyspnea that worsened over time. She also experienced fatigue, particularly in the morning, which made it difficult for her to perform daily activities. The patient denied any chest pain or cough, but mentioned a persistent dry cough. Her symptoms have progressively worsened over the past two weeks.

Physical Examination Findings:
Given the patient's age and severity level (1), the physical examination was conducted with caution to avoid exacerbating any potential life-threatening conditions. Vital signs were stable, with a blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg, pulse of 100 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. The patient exhibited significant respiratory distress, particularly during exertion, and had difficulty speaking in full sentences due to shortness of breath.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) was made. The patient's age and comorbidities also contributed to the severity of her condition.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient was started on oxygen therapy via nasal cannula at 2 liters per minute, with close monitoring for any signs of respiratory distress. She was prescribed a short-acting beta-agonist (SABA) inhaler for symptom relief and a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) inhaler to be taken twice daily as directed by her primary care physician. The patient was also advised to use a humidifier in her home to help manage her symptoms.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient is scheduled for follow-up with her primary care physician within 24 hours to reassess her condition and adjust treatment as needed. She is also advised to contact the clinic immediately if she experiences any worsening of symptoms, such as increased shortness of breath or chest pain.

Discharge Summary:

The patient was discharged in a stable condition, but with close monitoring for any signs of respiratory distress. The patient's family members were educated on how to administer oxygen therapy and use her inhalers properly.
