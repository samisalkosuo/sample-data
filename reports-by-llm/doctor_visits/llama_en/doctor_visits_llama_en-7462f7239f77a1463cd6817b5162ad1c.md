Visit Summary:

Date: 14.03.2024
Location: Laitila Clinic

Patient Information:
Female, age 29

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with a 2-day history of worsening abdominal pain, accompanied by nausea and vomiting.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient reported that her symptoms began after consuming a large meal at a social gathering. Initially, she experienced mild discomfort, but the pain gradually intensified over the next 24 hours. She also noticed some tenderness in the right lower quadrant of her abdomen. The patient's nausea and vomiting worsened throughout the day, with episodes occurring every few hours.

Physical Examination Findings:
Given the severity level of 4, the physical examination was focused on assessing the patient's overall stability and identifying any potential complications. Vital signs were within normal limits. Abdominal tenderness was confirmed in the right lower quadrant, and a palpable mass was detected approximately 2 cm below the right costal margin. The patient's abdomen was also slightly distended.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of acute appendicitis was made. The presence of abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and tenderness in the right lower quadrant are classic signs of this condition. The palpable mass is consistent with an inflamed appendix.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient was started on intravenous fluids to manage dehydration and electrolyte imbalances. She was also prescribed ciprofloxacin 500mg orally twice daily for a 7-day course to treat suspected appendicitis. The patient will be scheduled for surgical consultation to discuss the best course of treatment, including possible appendectomy.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient is advised to follow up with the surgeon in 2 weeks to discuss the planned surgery and any further management. She should also return to the clinic in 1 week to have her stitches removed (if applicable). The patient's family members are encouraged to contact the clinic if they experience any concerns or complications between visits.

Note: The severity level of 4 indicates that the patient is stable but requires more resources than those with less severe conditions. The plan and treatment outlined above are tailored to address this level of severity.
