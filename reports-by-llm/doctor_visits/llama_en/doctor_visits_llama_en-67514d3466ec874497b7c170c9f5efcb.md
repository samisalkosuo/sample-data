Patient Information:
Male, 53 years old

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with complaints of progressive left-sided chest pain radiating to the back, which worsened over the past 48 hours.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient reported a gradual increase in discomfort starting from the evening before, which has been exacerbated by physical activity. He described the pain as sharp and stabbing, often accompanied by shortness of breath and mild nausea. The patient denied any fever or recent travel history. Notably, he experienced a significant exacerbation during a morning walk yesterday.

Physical Examination Findings:
Given the severity level of 4, the examination was conducted with caution to avoid precipitating further distress. Vital signs were stable: blood pressure 140/90 mmHg, heart rate 92 bpm, respiratory rate 16 breaths/min, and oxygen saturation 98% on room air. The patient's left arm was slightly swollen, but no other significant abnormalities were noted.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
The clinical presentation is suggestive of acute coronary syndrome (ACS), specifically unstable angina. The patient's symptoms are consistent with myocardial ischemia, supported by the physical examination findings and history of progressive chest pain.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient was started on aspirin 81 mg PO qd, clopidogrel 75 mg PO qd, and a beta-blocker (metoprolol succinate) 50 mg PO bid. A stress test is scheduled for the following week to assess myocardial viability. The patient will be admitted to the coronary care unit for close monitoring.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient will return to the clinic in one week for follow-up and further evaluation of his cardiac status. He should contact the office immediately if he experiences any worsening symptoms, such as chest pain or shortness of breath.
