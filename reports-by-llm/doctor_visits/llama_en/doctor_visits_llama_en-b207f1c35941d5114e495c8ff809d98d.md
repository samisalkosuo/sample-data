**Visit Summary**

**Date:** 25.07.2025
**Location:** Luoto Clinic
**Severity Level:** 3 (Urgent)

**Patient Information:**
- **Gender:** Female
- **Age:** 91 years

**Chief Complaint:**
The patient presented with complaints of worsening shortness of breath and fatigue over the past week, which have significantly impacted her daily activities.

**History of Present Illness (HPI):**
The patient reported a gradual increase in dyspnea (shortness of breath) and fatigue, particularly after minimal exertion. She also mentioned an inability to perform her usual household chores without feeling excessively tired. The symptoms worsened over the past week, with the patient experiencing more pronounced shortness of breath during rest periods.

**Physical Examination Findings:**
Given the patient's age and severity level, a thorough physical examination was conducted with caution to avoid exacerbating any potential conditions. Vital signs were within normal limits. A chest X-ray revealed bilateral infiltrates consistent with pulmonary edema. The patient's oxygen saturation levels were consistently below 90% on room air.

**Assessment / Diagnosis:**
The patient is diagnosed with acute decompensated heart failure, complicated by pulmonary edema. This diagnosis is supported by the clinical presentation and radiographic findings.

**Plan / Treatment:**
- **Medications:** The patient was started on furosemide 40 mg IV every 6 hours as needed for fluid overload, and spironolactone 25 mg daily for heart failure management.
- **Monitoring:** Close monitoring of vital signs, oxygen saturation levels, and renal function is required. The patient will be admitted to the hospital for close observation and potential diuretic therapy adjustment.

**Follow-up Instructions:**
The patient is scheduled for a follow-up appointment in two weeks to assess improvement or need for further intervention. In the meantime, she should continue to take her medications as prescribed and report any changes in symptoms to the healthcare provider promptly.

**Additional Notes:** Due to the severity of this case and the patient's age, it was deemed necessary to admit her to the hospital for close monitoring and potential interventions.
