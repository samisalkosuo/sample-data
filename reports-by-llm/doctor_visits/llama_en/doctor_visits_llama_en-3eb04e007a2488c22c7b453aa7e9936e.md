**Visit Summary**

**Date:** September 9, 2024
**Location:** Turku Clinic
**Severity Level:** 5 (Non-urgent â€“ minor complaints)

**Patient Information:**
Female patient, age 104 years.

**Chief Complaint:**
The patient presented with a complaint of mild left-sided facial paresthesia and tingling sensation, which she reported started approximately 2 weeks prior to the visit. She also mentioned experiencing occasional difficulty swallowing solid foods.

**History of Present Illness (HPI):**
The patient's symptoms began after a recent bout of pneumonia, for which she was treated at home with antibiotics. Since then, she has experienced progressive numbness and tingling in her left facial area, particularly around the mouth and chin. The sensation is described as mild and intermittent, but it has been worsening over time. She also reported occasional difficulty swallowing solid foods, such as meat or bread, which has led to a slight weight loss.

**Physical Examination Findings:**
Given the patient's age and severity level, a thorough physical examination was conducted with caution to avoid exacerbating any potential underlying conditions. The patient's vital signs were within normal limits. A neurological examination revealed mild paresthesia in the left facial area, particularly around the mouth and chin. No other significant abnormalities were noted.

**Assessment / Diagnosis:**
Based on the patient's history and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) secondary to recent herpes zoster infection is suspected. The patient's age and symptoms are consistent with this condition, which typically affects older adults. Further testing, such as nerve conduction studies or electromyography, may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.

**Plan / Treatment:**
The patient will be prescribed antiviral medication (acyclovir) to treat any remaining herpes zoster lesions and reduce the risk of complications. Topical analgesics, such as lidocaine patches, will also be recommended for symptom management. The patient is advised to maintain good oral hygiene and avoid solid foods that may exacerbate swallowing difficulties.

**Follow-up Instructions:**
The patient will be scheduled for a follow-up appointment in 2 weeks to reassess her symptoms and adjust treatment as needed. In the meantime, she should contact the clinic if her symptoms worsen or if she experiences any difficulty breathing, swallowing, or speaking.

**Additional Notes:**

* The patient's age and underlying medical conditions (e.g., pneumonia) may require closer monitoring for potential complications.
* Further evaluation by a specialist, such as a neurologist, may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and develop an optimal treatment plan.
