Visit Summary:

Date: November 12, 2024
Location: Ruokolahti Clinic

Patient Information:
Female patient, age 18 years

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with complaints of mild abdominal pain and nausea, which started approximately 2 hours prior to the visit.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient reported that she had eaten a large meal at lunchtime and subsequently experienced a dull ache in her upper abdomen. The pain was described as crampy and radiated to her right lower quadrant. She also mentioned feeling nauseous, with episodes of vomiting occurring every 30 minutes. The patient denied any fever, chills, or recent travel history.

Physical Examination Findings:
Given the severity level of 5 (non-urgent), the physical examination was relatively unremarkable. Vital signs were within normal limits: blood pressure 110/70 mmHg, pulse 80 beats per minute, temperature 98.6°F (37°C). Abdominal examination revealed tenderness in the right lower quadrant, but no guarding or rebound tenderness. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of acute appendicitis is suspected. However, given the patient's age and lack of severe symptoms, an initial assessment of mild appendicitis is considered. Further imaging studies (e.g., ultrasound) are recommended to confirm the diagnosis.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient will be prescribed antibiotics (e.g., ciprofloxacin 500 mg twice daily for 5 days) to cover potential bacterial infection. She will also receive instructions on pain management with acetaminophen or ibuprofen as needed. The patient is advised to rest and avoid heavy lifting, bending, or strenuous activities.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient should return to the clinic in 2 weeks for follow-up evaluation. If symptoms worsen or do not improve, she should contact her healthcare provider immediately. Additionally, if any signs of peritonitis (e.g., severe abdominal pain, fever, or vomiting) occur, seek immediate medical attention.
