Visit Summary:

Date: March 4, 2024
Location: Rantasalmi Clinic

Patient Information:
Male patient, age 37 years.

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with complaints of worsening back pain and fatigue over the past week, which has significantly impacted his daily activities.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient reported a gradual increase in back pain, starting from mild discomfort to severe ache, particularly in the lower back region. He also experienced fatigue, which worsened over time, affecting his ability to perform physical tasks. The patient mentioned that he had been experiencing occasional numbness and tingling sensations in his legs, especially after prolonged sitting or standing for extended periods.

Physical Examination Findings:
Given the severity level of 4, the patient's presentation warrants a thorough examination. On physical examination, the patient exhibited tenderness and swelling in the lower back region, with limited range of motion. His vital signs were within normal limits. The neurological examination revealed decreased sensation in the lower extremities, particularly in the medial aspect.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of lumbar disc herniation is suspected. Further imaging studies (MRI) are recommended to confirm the diagnosis and assess any potential nerve compression.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient will be prescribed:

* A 5-day course of oral pain medication (ibuprofen 400mg three times daily)
* A physical therapy referral for postural correction and strengthening exercises
* Follow-up appointment in two weeks for re-evaluation

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient is advised to follow up with the clinic in two weeks for reassessment. In the meantime, he should continue to manage his pain with oral medication as prescribed and attend physical therapy sessions as scheduled.

Note: The patient's condition warrants close monitoring due to potential nerve compression, and further evaluation may be necessary if symptoms worsen or fail to improve with treatment.
