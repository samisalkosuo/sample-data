**Visit Summary**

**Date:** January 15, 2024
**Location:** Eura Clinic
**Severity Level:** 5 (Non-urgent â€“ minor complaints)

**Patient Information:**
Female patient, age 2 years.

**Chief Complaint:**
The patient's mother reported a small, itchy rash on her child's left arm, which appeared over the past 24 hours. The mother is concerned about the rash and its potential cause.

**History of Present Illness (HPI):**
The patient was otherwise healthy until the onset of the rash. The rash started as a small, red spot that gradually increased in size and became itchy. The child has not experienced any fever, vomiting, or other systemic symptoms. The mother reported that she had recently applied a new laundry detergent to her child's clothes, which may have caused the rash.

**Physical Examination Findings:**
The patient presented with a small, oval-shaped rash on her left arm, measuring approximately 2 cm in diameter. The rash was erythematous and slightly scaly, with mild itching. The skin surrounding the rash appeared normal. No other significant findings were noted during the examination.

**Assessment / Diagnosis:**
Based on the patient's presentation, a diagnosis of contact dermatitis due to laundry detergent exposure is suspected. This condition is common in children who come into contact with irritating substances, such as detergents or soaps. The rash is likely caused by an allergic reaction to one of the ingredients in the laundry detergent.

**Plan / Treatment:**
The patient will be prescribed a topical corticosteroid cream (0.05% hydrocortisone) to reduce inflammation and itching. The mother is advised to avoid further exposure to the laundry detergent until the rash has fully resolved. If the rash worsens or does not improve with treatment, a follow-up appointment will be scheduled.

**Follow-up Instructions:**
The patient should return for a follow-up examination in 3-5 days to assess the response to treatment and remove any remaining topical corticosteroid cream. The mother is also advised to monitor the patient's symptoms and seek immediate attention if the rash worsens, spreads, or is accompanied by fever, vomiting, or difficulty breathing.

**Additional Comments:**
The patient's age and presentation are consistent with contact dermatitis due to laundry detergent exposure. Further evaluation is not necessary at this time.
