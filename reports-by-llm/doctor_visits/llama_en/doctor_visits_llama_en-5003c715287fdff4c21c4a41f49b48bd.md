Patient Information:
- Gender: Male
- Age: 38 years old

Severity Level: 2 (Emergent – potential life threat)

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with a 2-day history of progressive left-sided chest pain radiating to the back, accompanied by shortness of breath and fatigue. He reported that the symptoms worsened over the past 24 hours.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient described his symptoms as follows: "I've been feeling this tightness in my chest for a couple of days now. It started on the left side, but it's spread to my back. I also get short of breath when I exert myself or even just walk up the stairs. Sometimes, I feel like I'm going to pass out." He denied any recent travel, exposure to chemicals, or significant trauma.

Physical Examination Findings:
Upon examination, the patient presented with a temperature of 38.5°C (101.3°F), blood pressure 140/90 mmHg, and pulse 102 beats per minute. The lungs were clear bilaterally, but there was a noticeable increase in respiratory rate. The cardiac examination revealed an S4 gallop and an opening snap heard at the apex. The patient's left arm showed signs of decreased mobility due to pain.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
Given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) with possible myocardial infarction (MI) was made. Further evaluation is necessary to confirm this suspicion.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient was started on aspirin 81mg daily, clopidogrel 75mg once daily, and metoprolol succinate 50mg twice daily for the management of ACS. A cardiac enzyme panel will be ordered to assess for evidence of MI. An electrocardiogram (ECG) is also recommended to evaluate for signs of ischemia or infarction.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient is scheduled for a follow-up appointment in one week to reassess his symptoms and adjust his treatment plan as necessary. He is advised to continue taking his medications as prescribed, monitor his blood pressure closely, and report any changes in his symptoms immediately.
