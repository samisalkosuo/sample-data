Location: Juuka Clinic

Patient Information:
- Gender: Female
- Age: 14 years old

Severity Level: 3 (Urgent)

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with a 2-day history of worsening abdominal pain, accompanied by nausea and vomiting. She reported that the pain is more pronounced after eating and has increased in intensity over the past 24 hours.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient's symptoms began on August 25, 2024, with mild cramping and discomfort. Initially, she thought it was related to a stomach virus but worsened over time. The pain is described as sharp and stabbing, located in the lower right quadrant of her abdomen. She has experienced two episodes of vomiting, which have resulted in dehydration. Her urine output has decreased significantly.

Physical Examination Findings:
Upon examination, the patient exhibited signs of dehydration (dry mucous membranes, sunken eyes). Her abdominal tenderness was noted, particularly in the lower right quadrant. The pain was exacerbated by movement and palpation. Her vital signs revealed a temperature of 38.5°C, blood pressure 90/60 mmHg, pulse 110 beats per minute, and respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of acute appendicitis is suspected. The severity level of 3 indicates that while the patient is stable, she requires prompt attention to prevent further complications.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient will be admitted for observation and treatment. She will receive intravenous fluids to correct dehydration and antibiotics to cover potential bacterial infections. An ultrasound examination will be performed to confirm the diagnosis and assess the appendix size. If necessary, surgical consultation will be sought.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient is scheduled for follow-up in 24 hours to reassess her condition and determine if further intervention is required. She should report any worsening symptoms or signs of complications (e.g., fever above 39°C, abdominal tenderness, or vomiting blood).
