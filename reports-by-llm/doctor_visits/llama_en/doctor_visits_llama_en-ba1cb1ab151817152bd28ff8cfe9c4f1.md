Patient Information:
Gender: Female
Age: 51

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with complaints of worsening shortness of breath and fatigue over the past few weeks, which have progressively worsened despite increasing physical activity.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient reported a gradual increase in symptoms over the past 6-8 weeks. Initially, she experienced mild dyspnea on exertion, but it has since progressed to more pronounced shortness of breath at rest and with minimal exertion. Fatigue is also a significant symptom, affecting her daily activities. The patient denied any recent travel or exposure to potential infectious agents. She reported no fever, chest pain, or cough.

Physical Examination Findings:
Given the severity level of 4, the physical examination was focused on assessing the patient's respiratory status and overall well-being. Vital signs were as follows: blood pressure 140/90 mmHg, pulse 92 bpm, oxygen saturation 88% on room air, and respiratory rate 24 breaths/min. The patient exhibited signs of fatigue, including decreased mobility and a general feeling of malaise. Lung exam revealed bilateral wheezes and fine crackles bilaterally.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation was made. The patient's history of smoking and long-standing respiratory symptoms are consistent with this diagnosis.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient was prescribed oral corticosteroids 40 mg daily for 7-10 days to reduce inflammation and improve lung function. In addition, she will be started on a short-course inhaler regimen consisting of fluticasone propionate 250 mcg twice daily and salmeterol xinafoate 500 mcg twice daily. The patient was also advised to increase her fluid intake and avoid strenuous activities for the next few weeks.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient is scheduled for a follow-up appointment in 2 weeks to reassess her lung function and adjust her treatment plan as needed. She should return to the clinic if she experiences any worsening of symptoms, such as increased shortness of breath or cough production.
