**Visit Summary**

**Date:** April 4, 2025
**Location:** Vaasa Clinic
**Severity Level:** 3 (Urgent – stable, needs 2+ resources)

**Patient Information:**
- **Gender:** Female
- **Age:** 11 years old

**Chief Complaint:**
The patient presented with a 2-day history of worsening abdominal pain and vomiting. The patient's mother reported that the child had been experiencing mild to moderate abdominal discomfort after eating breakfast, which gradually worsened over the past two days.

**History of Present Illness (HPI):**
The patient's symptoms began on March 22, 2025, with a mild cramp in her abdomen after consuming a meal. Initially, she was able to manage her pain with over-the-counter antacids but found it increasing in severity and duration. The child has been experiencing nausea and vomiting, which have led to dehydration. She also reported occasional episodes of fever, approximately 38°C (100.4°F), without any other accompanying symptoms.

**Physical Examination Findings:**
Given the patient's age and symptoms, a thorough abdominal examination was performed. Tenderness in the right lower quadrant was noted, with guarding present upon palpation. The abdomen was slightly distended, and bowel sounds were decreased. The child appeared dehydrated, with dry mucous membranes.

**Assessment / Diagnosis:**
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of acute appendicitis is suspected. The severity level of 3 indicates that while the situation requires immediate attention, the patient is stable at this time and can be managed in an outpatient setting with appropriate resources available for potential complications.

**Plan / Treatment:**
The child will undergo imaging studies (CT scan or ultrasound) to confirm the diagnosis of appendicitis. She will also receive intravenous fluids to address dehydration and possibly antibiotics if there's suspicion of bacterial infection. The patient will be scheduled for surgical consultation to discuss the best course of action, which may include an open appendectomy.

**Follow-up Instructions:**
The child is advised to follow up with her primary care physician within 2 weeks to review her progress and adjust treatment as necessary. She should also schedule a follow-up appointment with the surgeon before undergoing any surgical procedure. The patient's mother will be contacted for further instructions on managing her child's symptoms at home.

**Additional Notes:**
The patient's family has been informed about the potential risks associated with appendicitis, including rupture and peritonitis. They have also been advised to monitor their child's condition closely and seek immediate medical attention if symptoms worsen or do not improve with treatment.
