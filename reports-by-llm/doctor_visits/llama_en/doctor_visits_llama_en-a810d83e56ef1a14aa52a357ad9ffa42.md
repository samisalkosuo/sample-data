Date: November 1, 2025
Location: Sipoo Clinic

Patient Information:
Male, 43 years old

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with complaints of progressive left-sided chest pain radiating to the back, which worsened over the past 48 hours. He reported difficulty breathing and a feeling of impending doom.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient described his symptoms as starting with mild discomfort that gradually intensified, becoming more severe and localized to the left side of his chest. He experienced shortness of breath and a sense of anxiety, which further exacerbated his pain. The patient reported no recent travel or exposure to potential allergens.

Physical Examination Findings:
Given the severity level of 5, the physical examination was conducted with caution to avoid exacerbating the patient's condition. Vital signs were stable, but the patient exhibited significant distress and discomfort. A thorough chest examination revealed a dullness to percussion over the left lower quadrant, consistent with pleural effusion. The patient's oxygen saturation was 92% on room air.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism (PE) was made. The patient's age, sex, and presentation were consistent with this diagnosis.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient was started on anticoagulation therapy with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), 1.5 mg/kg subcutaneously twice daily. He was also prescribed oxygen therapy via nasal cannula at 4 L/min and a non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) mask for supplemental oxygen as needed. The patient was advised to remain ambulatory and avoid heavy lifting or strenuous activities.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient is scheduled for follow-up in 2 weeks to reassess his condition and adjust his treatment plan as necessary. He should return to the clinic with any concerns or worsening symptoms, including difficulty breathing, chest pain, or dizziness. The patient's family was educated on recognizing signs of pulmonary embolism recurrence and the importance of adhering to his medication regimen.

Discharge Instructions:
The patient was discharged home with instructions for oxygen therapy and NIPPV mask use. He was advised to contact the clinic immediately if he experienced any worsening symptoms or concerns.
