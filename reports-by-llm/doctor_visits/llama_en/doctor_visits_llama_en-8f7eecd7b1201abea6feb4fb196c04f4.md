Location: Savitaipale Clinic

Patient Information:
Male, 105 years old

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with complaints of progressive shortness of breath and fatigue over the past week, which have worsened over the past two days.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient reported feeling increasingly short of breath, even when sitting still or engaging in light physical activity. He also experienced fatigue, particularly after rising from a lying position. The patient's breathing has become more labored, and he reports feeling like he is "drowning" in his own lungs. There is no mention of chest pain, cough, or fever.

Physical Examination Findings:
Given the patient's advanced age and severity level 2, the physical examination was focused on assessing respiratory function and overall stability. The patient appeared anxious and uncomfortable, but vital signs were relatively stable: blood pressure 160/90 mmHg, heart rate 110 bpm, oxygen saturation 92% on room air. Lung sounds were clear bilaterally, with no evidence of consolidation or wheezing. The patient's respiratory rate was 24 breaths per minute, which is elevated but not alarming in the context of his overall clinical picture.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
The patient's presentation is consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation, given the progressive nature of his symptoms and the absence of acute chest pain or fever. The patient's age and comorbidities also suggest a high risk for respiratory complications.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient was started on oxygen therapy via nasal cannula at 2 liters per minute, with close monitoring of saturation levels. He was prescribed oral corticosteroids (prednisone) 40 mg daily for 5 days to help reduce inflammation and improve lung function. The patient was also advised to use a humidifier in his home to help manage symptoms.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient is scheduled for follow-up in one week to reassess his condition and adjust treatment as needed. His primary care physician will contact him to discuss any concerns or changes in his symptoms.
