Location: Ruokolahti Clinic

Patient Information:
Gender: Female
Age: 81 years

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with complaints of worsening shortness of breath and fatigue over the past week, which has significantly impacted her daily activities.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient reported a gradual increase in dyspnea, particularly during exertion, and an overall feeling of exhaustion. She also mentioned experiencing orthopnea, where she feels short of breath while lying down. The patient's symptoms worsened over the past few days, leading her to seek medical attention.

Physical Examination Findings:
Given the patient's age and severity level (1), a thorough and expedited evaluation was conducted. Vital signs revealed tachypnea (24 breaths/min) and tachycardia (120 beats/min). Oxygen saturation was 92% on room air. The patient's blood pressure was 160/90 mmHg, indicating hypertension. A rapid sequence intubation was performed due to the high risk of respiratory failure.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
The patient's presentation is consistent with acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF), characterized by severe shortness of breath and fatigue. The presence of orthopnea further supports this diagnosis.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient was started on intravenous furosemide 40 mg IV q 6 hours, and nitroglycerin 3 mg IV bolus followed by a continuous infusion of 10 mcg/hour. Oxygen therapy was initiated at 4 liters/minute via nasal cannula. The patient was also prescribed spironolactone 25 mg orally twice daily for its diuretic and anti-fibrotic properties.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient will be admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for close monitoring and further management. A follow-up appointment has been scheduled for 24 hours post-admission to reassess her condition and adjust treatment as needed. The patient's family was educated on the importance of maintaining a low-sodium diet, avoiding heavy lifting, and increasing fluid intake.

Discharge Instructions:
The patient will require assistance with daily activities due to her compromised respiratory status. A home oxygen therapy regimen will be prescribed, and follow-up appointments will be scheduled every 2 weeks until discharge from the hospital.
