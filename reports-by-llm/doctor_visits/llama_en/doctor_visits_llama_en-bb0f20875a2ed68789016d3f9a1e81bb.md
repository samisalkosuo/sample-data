**Visit Summary**

**Date:** 30.05.2025
**Location:** Helsinki Clinic, Finland
**Severity Level:** 2 (Emergent – potential life threat)

**Patient Information:**
Male patient, aged 102 years.

**Chief Complaint:**
The patient presented with complaints of progressive shortness of breath and fatigue over the past week, which have worsened over the past two days. He reported feeling increasingly weak and having difficulty performing daily activities due to his respiratory symptoms.

**History of Present Illness (HPI):**
The patient's shortness of breath is described as a dull, non-productive cough with occasional wheezing, particularly in the morning and after exertion. He also reports experiencing chest tightness and feeling like he cannot catch his breath. The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and has been smoking for over 50 years. His symptoms have progressively worsened over the past week, with an increase in shortness of breath and fatigue.

**Physical Examination Findings:**
Given the patient's age and severity level, a thorough physical examination was performed to assess his respiratory status. The patient appeared anxious and uncomfortable, with a low-grade fever (38°C) and a slightly elevated pulse rate (110 bpm). His oxygen saturation levels were 92% on room air, indicating mild hypoxemia. Lung sounds were bilaterally clear, but there was a noticeable decrease in breath sounds over the left lower lung field. The patient's cardiovascular system appeared stable, with no signs of cardiac distress.

**Assessment / Diagnosis:**
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of acute exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD) is suspected. The patient's age and comorbidities also raise concerns for possible pneumonia or other respiratory infections. Further testing, including a chest X-ray and possibly a CT scan, may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.

**Plan / Treatment:**
The patient will be started on oxygen therapy (2L/min via nasal cannula) to improve his oxygen saturation levels. He will also receive bronchodilator medication (albuterol 2 puffs every 4 hours as needed) to help manage his respiratory symptoms. The patient's COPD medication regimen will be adjusted to include a higher dose of corticosteroids and a long-acting beta-agonist (LABA). Antibiotics may be prescribed if pneumonia or another infection is confirmed.

**Follow-up Instructions:**
The patient will be scheduled for follow-up in 24 hours to reassess his condition. If his symptoms worsen or he experiences any increase in shortness of breath, chest pain, or fever, he should contact the clinic immediately. The patient's family members will also receive instructions on how to administer oxygen therapy and manage his medication regimen at home.

**Additional Notes:**
Given the patient's age and comorbidities, close monitoring of his condition is essential to prevent any potential complications. Regular follow-up appointments will be scheduled to ensure the patient receives adequate care and support during this challenging time.
