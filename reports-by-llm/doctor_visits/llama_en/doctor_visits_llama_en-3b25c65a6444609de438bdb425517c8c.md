Location: Pihtipudas Clinic

Patient Information:
Gender: Female
Age: 80 years

Severity Level: 2 (Emergent â€“ potential life threat)

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with a 2-day history of progressive shortness of breath, orthopnea, and fatigue. She reported worsening symptoms over the past 24 hours, which led her to seek medical attention.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient's symptoms began after a recent hospitalization for pneumonia. She was discharged 5 days ago and has been experiencing increasing shortness of breath, particularly in the morning and evening. The patient also reported coughing up pink, frothy sputum, which worsened over time. Her fatigue is severe enough to limit her daily activities.

Physical Examination Findings:
Vital signs: Blood pressure 140/90 mmHg, pulse 100/min, respiratory rate 24/min, oxygen saturation 92% on room air.
The patient appeared anxious and short of breath. Lung exam revealed bilateral crackles in the bases, consistent with pulmonary edema. Cardiac examination showed no significant abnormalities.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of acute heart failure (HF) is suspected. The patient's history of recent pneumonia and current respiratory symptoms are consistent with cardiogenic pulmonary edema. Further testing, including ECG, troponin levels, and echocardiogram, will be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient was started on furosemide 40mg IV every 6 hours as needed for dyspnea, and lisinopril 2.5mg daily for hypertension management. Oxygen therapy was initiated at 4L/min via nasal cannula. The patient will be closely monitored for signs of worsening heart failure.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient is scheduled to follow up with the cardiologist in 3 days to reassess her condition and adjust treatment as needed. She should return to the clinic if she experiences any increase in shortness of breath, chest pain, or coughing up blood.
