**Visit Summary**

**Date:** May 6, 2025
**Location:** Konnevesi Clinic
**Severity Level:** 4 (Less-urgent â€“ stable, 1 resource)

**Patient Information:**
Female patient, age 81 years.

**Chief Complaint:**
The patient presented with complaints of progressive shortness of breath and fatigue over the past week. She reported feeling increasingly weak and having difficulty performing daily activities due to her respiratory symptoms.

**History of Present Illness (HPI):**
The patient's symptoms began approximately one week ago, with a gradual increase in shortness of breath during exertion. She described her breathing as "catching her breath" after even minor physical activity. The patient also reported experiencing fatigue, particularly in the morning, which has worsened over time. There is no history of chest pain or cough.

**Physical Examination Findings:**
Given the patient's age and severity level, a thorough physical examination was performed to assess for any underlying conditions contributing to her symptoms. Vital signs were within normal limits. The patient's oxygen saturation was 95% on room air. Lung sounds were clear bilaterally, with no evidence of wheezing or crackles. The patient's cardiac examination revealed a regular rhythm and no murmurs. A thorough neurological examination did not reveal any focal deficits.

**Assessment / Diagnosis:**
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation is suspected. The patient's age and history of smoking are consistent with this diagnosis. Further testing, such as spirometry, may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.

**Plan / Treatment:**
The patient will be prescribed a short-course inhaler therapy with bronchodilators and a corticosteroid. She will also receive oxygen therapy as needed to maintain an oxygen saturation of 90% or higher. The patient is advised to avoid strenuous activities and to use her inhalers as directed.

**Follow-up Instructions:**
The patient will be scheduled for follow-up in two weeks to assess the effectiveness of treatment and to monitor for any signs of worsening symptoms. She is also advised to attend a pulmonary rehabilitation program to improve her overall lung function and exercise tolerance.

**Additional Recommendations:**

* The patient should avoid exposure to secondhand smoke.
* She should maintain a healthy diet and stay hydrated to support her respiratory health.
* Regular follow-up appointments will be scheduled to monitor the patient's condition and adjust treatment as necessary.
