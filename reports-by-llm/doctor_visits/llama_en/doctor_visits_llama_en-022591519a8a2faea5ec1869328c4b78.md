Visit Summary:

Date: August 6, 2024
Location: Hollola Clinic

Patient Information:
Female patient, age 63

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with complaints of worsening shortness of breath and fatigue over the past few weeks.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient reported a gradual increase in symptoms, starting with mild exertional dyspnea that worsened over time. She described feeling winded even when performing light activities such as walking or doing household chores. The patient also experienced fatigue, which interfered with her daily routine and sleep patterns. There was no recent travel history or exposure to potential allergens.

Physical Examination Findings:
Given the severity level of 5 (non-urgent), the physical examination was relatively unremarkable. Vital signs were within normal limits: blood pressure 120/80 mmHg, pulse 72 beats per minute, respiratory rate 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 98% on room air. The patient's lungs were clear to auscultation, and there was no evidence of wheezing or crackles. The cardiac examination revealed a normal heart rate and rhythm.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, the diagnosis is chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation. The patient's history of smoking and exposure to environmental pollutants likely contributed to her current condition.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient was prescribed a short-course inhaler therapy with fluticasone propionate 250 mcg twice daily for 7 days, in addition to a low-dose oral corticosteroid (prednisone) 20 mg once daily for 5 days. The patient was also advised to use a humidifier in her home and avoid exposure to potential triggers such as tobacco smoke and strong chemicals.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient is scheduled for follow-up appointment in 2 weeks to reassess her symptoms and adjust treatment as needed. She is instructed to monitor her oxygen saturation levels at home using a pulse oximeter and report any changes or concerns to the clinic.
