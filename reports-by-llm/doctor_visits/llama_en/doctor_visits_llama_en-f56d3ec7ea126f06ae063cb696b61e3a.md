Location: Raahe Clinic

Patient Information:
Male patient, age 13, presenting with chief complaint of abdominal pain and vomiting.

Chief Complaint:
The patient's mother reported that her son has been experiencing severe abdominal pain for the past two days, accompanied by nausea and vomiting. The pain is described as sharp and stabbing, located in the upper right quadrant of his abdomen. He has also experienced some feverishness and general malaise.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient's symptoms began two days ago, after he consumed a large amount of spoiled food from a street vendor. Since then, his condition has progressively worsened, with increasing severity of abdominal pain and vomiting. The patient reports that the pain is exacerbated by movement and relieved by rest.

Physical Examination Findings:
Given the severity level of 4, the physical examination findings are focused on assessing for signs of dehydration, peritonitis, or other complications. The patient appears pale and slightly dehydrated, with a temperature of 38.5Â°C. Abdominal tenderness is present in the upper right quadrant, with guarding (muscle tension) noted upon palpation. Rebound tenderness is also present.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of acute appendicitis is suspected. The presence of abdominal pain, vomiting, feverishness, and rebound tenderness are all consistent with this condition. Further diagnostic testing, such as imaging studies (e.g., ultrasound or CT scan), may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient will be admitted to the hospital for observation and treatment. He will receive intravenous fluids to address dehydration and potential electrolyte imbalances. Antibiotics will be administered to cover for possible bacterial infection. The patient will also undergo imaging studies to confirm the diagnosis of appendicitis. If necessary, surgical consultation may be obtained for potential appendectomy.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient is scheduled for follow-up in two days to assess for resolution of symptoms and to evaluate for any complications. His mother should contact the clinic if his condition worsens or if he experiences any signs of sepsis (e.g., difficulty breathing, rapid heartbeat).
