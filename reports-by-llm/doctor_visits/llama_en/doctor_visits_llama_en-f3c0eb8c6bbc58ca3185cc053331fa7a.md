Patient Information:
Male, age 35

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with complaints of progressive left-sided chest pain radiating to the back, accompanied by shortness of breath and fatigue over the past 3 days.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient reported a gradual increase in symptoms starting from 2 days ago. The chest pain worsened over time, becoming more severe and persistent. He also experienced shortness of breath, particularly during exertion, and felt fatigued throughout the day. There was no mention of fever, chills, or other systemic symptoms.

Physical Examination Findings:
Given the severity level of 2, the patient's presentation warrants a thorough evaluation. The patient appeared anxious but cooperative. Vital signs were within normal limits: blood pressure 120/80 mmHg, pulse 72 beats/min, respiratory rate 16 breaths/min, oxygen saturation 98% on room air. The patient exhibited a slight decrease in lung sounds bilaterally, with more pronounced dullness over the left lower lung field. Cardiac examination revealed no murmurs or gallops.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is suspected. Further evaluation is needed to confirm this diagnosis.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient was started on aspirin 81mg PO daily for antiplatelet effects, and clopidogrel 75mg PO daily for secondary prevention. The patient was also prescribed metoprolol succinate 50mg PO twice daily for beta-blockade. A statin (atorvastatin 20mg PO daily) was initiated to manage cholesterol levels. The patient will undergo further evaluation with echocardiography and cardiac biomarkers to confirm the diagnosis.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient is scheduled for follow-up in 2 weeks to reassess symptoms, monitor laboratory results, and adjust medication as needed. In the meantime, the patient should adhere to a low-sodium diet, avoid heavy lifting or strenuous exercise, and report any worsening symptoms immediately.

Severity Level: 2

Note: The severity level of 2 indicates that the patient's condition is potentially life-threatening but not immediately life-threatening (severity level 1).
