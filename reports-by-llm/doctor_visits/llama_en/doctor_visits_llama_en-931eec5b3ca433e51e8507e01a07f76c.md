**Visit Summary**

**Date:** May 11, 2023
**Location:** Lapinjärvi Clinic
**Severity Level:** 4 (Less-urgent – stable, 1 resource)

**Patient Information:**
Male patient, age 87.

**Chief Complaint:**
The patient presented with complaints of worsening shortness of breath and fatigue over the past week. He reported difficulty breathing during exertion and experiencing increased fatigue despite regular rest.

**History of Present Illness (HPI):**
The patient's symptoms began approximately two weeks ago, following a recent hospitalization for pneumonia. Since then, his condition has progressively worsened, with increasing shortness of breath and fatigue. The patient reports no chest pain or cough, but does experience orthopnea (waking up multiple times during the night due to difficulty breathing). He also mentions feeling weak and having decreased appetite.

**Physical Examination Findings:**
Given the patient's age and severity level, a thorough physical examination was conducted with caution. Vital signs were stable, with a blood pressure of 140/80 mmHg, pulse of 90 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on room air. The patient exhibited mild bilateral crackles in the lungs bilaterally, consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). His respiratory rate was slightly elevated at 24 breaths per minute.

**Assessment / Diagnosis:**
Based on the patient's history and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of COPD exacerbation is made. The patient's age and comorbidities also contribute to his overall risk for complications from this condition.

**Plan / Treatment:**
The patient will be prescribed a short-course inhaler therapy with bronchodilators (albuterol) as needed, in addition to a maintenance inhaler containing fluticasone. He will also receive oxygen therapy via nasal cannula at 2 liters per minute during exacerbations and at 1 liter per minute at rest. The patient is advised to maintain good hydration and avoid strenuous activities.

**Follow-up Instructions:**
The patient should follow up with his primary care physician in two weeks for a re-evaluation of his condition. In the meantime, he should contact the clinic if his symptoms worsen or if he experiences any concerning signs such as chest pain, severe shortness of breath, or confusion.

**Additional Recommendations:**

* The patient's family members are advised to monitor his oxygen saturation levels and report any changes to the clinic.
* Regular follow-up appointments will be scheduled to assess the patient's response to treatment and adjust management as needed.
