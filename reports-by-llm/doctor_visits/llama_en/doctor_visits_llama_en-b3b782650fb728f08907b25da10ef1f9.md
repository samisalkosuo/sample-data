Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with a 2-day history of progressive dyspnea and orthopnea, which worsened over the past 24 hours. He reported feeling short of breath even at rest and experiencing nocturnal awakenings due to difficulty breathing.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient's symptoms began 48 hours ago, with an initial onset of mild fatigue and non-productive cough. Over the next 24 hours, his shortness of breath worsened, and he started experiencing orthopnea, which is a feeling of discomfort while lying down. He also reported chest pain that radiates to his back, which occurs with deep breathing.

Physical Examination Findings:
Upon examination, the patient exhibited signs of respiratory distress, including increased respiratory rate (24 breaths/min), use of accessory muscles for respiration, and bilateral wheezes. His oxygen saturation was 92% on room air. The patient's vital signs were as follows: blood pressure 140/90 mmHg, pulse 110 beats/min, temperature 37.4°C, and respiratory rate 24 breaths/min.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
The patient's presentation is consistent with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with possible pneumonia. Further diagnostic testing, including a chest X-ray and possibly arterial blood gas analysis, will be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.

Plan / Treatment:
- The patient was started on oxygen therapy via nasal cannula at 4 liters per minute.
- He was prescribed oral antibiotics for suspected pneumonia (amoxicillin-clavulanate 500 mg twice daily).
- A follow-up appointment with a pulmonologist is scheduled for February 10, 2025.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient should return to the clinic on February 10, 2025, at which time he will be evaluated by a pulmonologist. The patient should continue to use oxygen therapy as prescribed and report any worsening symptoms immediately.
