**Visit Summary**

**Date:** 18 June 2024
**Location:** Vaala Clinic
**Severity Level:** 1 (Resuscitation â€“ immediate life threat)

**Patient Information:**
- **Gender:** Female
- **Age:** 67 years

**Chief Complaint:**
The patient presented with difficulty breathing and a feeling of impending doom.

**History of Present Illness (HPI):**
The patient reported experiencing sudden onset dyspnea, which began approximately 30 minutes prior to presentation. She described the sensation as "choking" without any preceding symptoms or triggers. The patient was unable to speak in full sentences due to shortness of breath and appeared anxious.

**Physical Examination Findings:**
Given the severity level, a thorough examination was conducted with expedited measures taken to ensure the patient's safety. Vital signs were checked, and oxygen saturation was found to be 92% on room air. The patient's blood pressure was 140/90 mmHg, heart rate was 110 beats per minute, and respiratory rate was 24 breaths per minute.

A rapid sequence intubation (RSI) was performed due to the high risk of cardiac arrest. The patient was successfully intubated without complications, and supplemental oxygen was administered at a rate of 10 liters per minute via face mask.

**Assessment / Diagnosis:**
The patient's presentation is consistent with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), likely precipitated by an undetermined cause such as pneumonia or pulmonary embolism. The low oxygen saturation and high heart rate suggest severe hypoxemia, which necessitates immediate intervention.

**Plan / Treatment:**
- **Medications:** The patient was administered 100% oxygen via non-rebreather mask, fentanyl 50 mcg IV bolus for pain management, and atropine 0.5 mg IV bolus to manage bradycardia.
- **Procedures:** A rapid sequence intubation was performed due to the high risk of cardiac arrest.

**Follow-up Instructions:**
The patient will be admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for close monitoring and further evaluation. The patient's family has been informed, and they are advised to contact the clinic immediately if there is any change in the patient's condition. A follow-up appointment will be scheduled once the patient is stable enough to be seen by a physician.

**Additional Notes:**
The patient was stabilized with immediate interventions due to the high severity of her presentation. Further diagnostic testing, including chest X-ray and arterial blood gas analysis, will be ordered upon admission to the ICU to determine the underlying cause of her respiratory distress.
