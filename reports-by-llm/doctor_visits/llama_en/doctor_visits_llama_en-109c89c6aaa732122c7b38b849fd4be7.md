Patient Information:
Male patient, age 70 years

The patient presented with complaints of progressive difficulty breathing and a persistent cough, which worsened over the past few days.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient reported that he has been experiencing increasing shortness of breath, particularly during exertion, and a dry, non-productive cough. He also mentioned feeling fatigued and having a general feeling of malaise. The symptoms started approximately 5 days ago and have progressively worsened. The patient denied any recent travel or exposure to potential infectious agents.

Physical Examination Findings:
Given the severity level of 2, the physical examination was focused on assessing respiratory function and identifying potential causes of the patient's symptoms. Vital signs were within normal limits, with a blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg, pulse of 100 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on room air. The patient's lung fields were clear to auscultation, but there was a noticeable decrease in breath sounds bilaterally. The patient's chest was slightly enlarged, and the liver was palpable 2 cm below the costal margin.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation was made. The patient's age and smoking history also contributed to this diagnosis.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient was prescribed a short-course inhaler regimen consisting of fluticasone propionate 250 mcg twice daily and salmeterol 50 mcg twice daily. He was also advised to use a humidifier in his home to help manage symptoms. The patient's family member was instructed on how to administer the medication and monitor for potential side effects.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient is scheduled for follow-up in 2 weeks to reassess his condition and adjust treatment as needed. It is essential that he adheres to the prescribed medication regimen and follows up with his primary care physician if symptoms worsen or do not improve.

Discharge Summary:

The patient was discharged home with a plan to manage his COPD exacerbation. The patient's family member was provided with information on how to recognize signs of worsening symptoms, such as increased shortness of breath or chest pain.
