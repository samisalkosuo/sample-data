**Patient Information:**
Female patient, age 75 years

**Chief Complaint:**
The patient presented with complaints of progressive difficulty breathing and fatigue over the past week.

**History of Present Illness (HPI):**
The patient reported a gradual worsening of shortness of breath, particularly during exertion, which has led to decreased activity levels. She also experiences fatigue, which is more pronounced in the morning. The patient's symptoms have been persistent, with no recent improvement or resolution. There is no history of trauma, fever, or significant respiratory infections.

**Physical Examination Findings:**
Given the severity level of 5 (non-urgent), the physical examination was focused on assessing the patient's overall condition and identifying any potential contributing factors. Vital signs were within normal limits. The patient's oxygen saturation was 98% on room air. Lung sounds were clear bilaterally, with no evidence of wheezing or crackles. The patient's cardiovascular system was stable, with a regular rhythm and blood pressure within normal limits.

**Assessment / Diagnosis:**
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, the diagnosis is chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation. The patient's age and history of smoking are contributing factors to her condition.

**Plan / Treatment:**
The patient will be prescribed a short-course inhaler therapy with bronchodilators and a corticosteroid. She will also receive instructions on proper inhaler technique and follow-up appointments for monitoring. Additionally, the patient will be advised to maintain a healthy lifestyle, including regular exercise, smoking cessation, and avoiding exposure to pollutants.

**Follow-up Instructions:**
The patient is scheduled for a follow-up appointment in two weeks to assess her response to treatment and adjust the medication regimen as needed. She should also contact the clinic if she experiences any worsening of symptoms or concerns between appointments.

**Additional Notes:** The patient's family members will be educated on recognizing signs of exacerbation, such as increased shortness of breath, coughing, and chest tightness. They will also be advised to monitor the patient's oxygen saturation levels at home and report any changes to the clinic.
