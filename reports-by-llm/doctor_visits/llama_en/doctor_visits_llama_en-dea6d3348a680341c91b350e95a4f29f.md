Location: II Clinic/Hospital

Patient Information:
Gender: Female
Age: 40

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with complaints of worsening back pain, radiating to her left leg, and intermittent numbness in her toes over the past few weeks.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient reported a gradual increase in back pain, which started as a dull ache but has progressed to a sharp, stabbing sensation. She described the pain as being worse when she moves or lifts heavy objects. The pain radiates down to her left leg and is accompanied by intermittent numbness in her toes. The patient also reports difficulty walking due to the pain. She denied any recent trauma or injury.

Physical Examination Findings:
Given the severity level of 5, the physical examination was focused on assessing the patient's overall condition and identifying any potential complications. Vital signs were within normal limits. The patient's back pain was assessed as a 7/10 in terms of intensity, with the pain being more pronounced when she moved or lifted objects. Neurological examination revealed decreased sensation in her left lower extremity, consistent with radiculopathy.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, the diagnosis is lumbar radiculopathy due to a herniated disc at L4-L5. The patient's age and gender are also consistent with this diagnosis.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient was prescribed 500mg of ibuprofen three times daily for pain management and 20mg of pregabalin twice daily for nerve pain. She was also advised to avoid heavy lifting, bending, or strenuous activities until further notice. A referral to an orthopedic specialist was made for potential surgical intervention.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient is scheduled for a follow-up appointment in two weeks to reassess her condition and adjust the treatment plan as needed. She is also advised to maintain a weight of 150lbs or less to reduce pressure on her spine.
