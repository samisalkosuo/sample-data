Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with complaints of progressive left-sided chest pain radiating to the back, which worsened over the past 48 hours.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient reported a gradual increase in discomfort starting from the evening before his visit. The pain is described as sharp and stabbing, particularly when he takes deep breaths or coughs. He also experiences occasional nausea and mild shortness of breath. There was no history of trauma or recent exposure to allergens.

Physical Examination Findings:
Given the severity level of 2 (Emergent â€“ potential life threat), a thorough examination was conducted with attention to cardiovascular, respiratory, and musculoskeletal systems. The patient's vital signs were stable at this point but showed signs of distress: blood pressure 140/90 mmHg, heart rate 92 beats per minute, oxygen saturation 98% on room air.

- Cardiovascular System: Blood pressure was within normal limits, but the patient exhibited a slight increase in heart rate and mild tachycardia.
- Respiratory System: The lungs were clear to auscultation with no evidence of consolidation or wheezing. The patient's oxygen saturation remained stable at 98% on room air.
- Musculoskeletal System: No abnormalities were noted in the musculoskeletal examination.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is suspected. Further diagnostic testing will be necessary to confirm this suspicion.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient was started on aspirin 81mg daily for its antiplatelet effects and clopidogrel 75mg once daily for its antiplatelet properties. A statin was also initiated due to the high risk of cardiovascular events in patients with ACS. The patient will be scheduled for a stress test or echocardiogram within the next week to assess cardiac function.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient is advised to follow up with his primary care physician within 2 weeks for further evaluation and management. He should also contact the clinic immediately if he experiences worsening chest pain, shortness of breath, or any other concerning symptoms.
