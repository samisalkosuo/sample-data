Visit Summary:

Date: October 8, 2024
Location: Asikkala Clinic

Patient Information:
Gender: Female
Age: 77 years

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with complaints of worsening shortness of breath and fatigue over the past week.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient reported a gradual increase in difficulty breathing during exertion, which has worsened over the past few days. She also experiences fatigue, particularly after rising from a lying position. The patient denies any chest pain or coughing up blood. Her symptoms are not relieved by rest and have led to her concern about potential heart disease.

Physical Examination Findings:
Given the patient's age and severity level (1), immediate attention is required. Vital signs revealed a blood pressure of 160/90 mmHg, pulse rate of 110 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on room air. The patient was short of breath in all lung fields with bilateral wheezes. Cardiac examination revealed an irregularly irregular rhythm (atrial fibrillation) with a rapid ventricular response.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
The patient's presentation is consistent with acute heart failure, likely secondary to atrial fibrillation and possible coronary artery disease. The presence of atrial fibrillation warrants immediate evaluation for potential embolic events or cardiac tamponade.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient was started on 500 mg of aspirin, 325 mg of extended-release dipyridamole, and 50 mg of warfarin (INR 2-3 target range). She will be admitted to the cardiology ward for further evaluation and management. The patient's oxygen saturation will be monitored closely, and she will receive oxygen therapy as needed.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient is scheduled for follow-up with her primary care physician in two weeks to reassess her condition and adjust medications as necessary. Her cardiologist will contact her within 24 hours to discuss further management and potential cardiac catheterization if indicated.

Discharge Summary:
The patient was discharged home on oxygen therapy, with instructions to call the clinic immediately if she experiences worsening shortness of breath or chest pain.
