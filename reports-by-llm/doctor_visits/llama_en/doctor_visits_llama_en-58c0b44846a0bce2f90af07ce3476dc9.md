**Visit Summary**

**Date:** October 21, 2023
**Location:** Eura Clinic
**Severity Level:** 2 (Emergent â€“ potential life threat)

**Patient Information:**
Female patient, age 102 years.

**Chief Complaint:**
The patient presented with complaints of progressive shortness of breath and fatigue over the past week. She reported feeling increasingly weak and having difficulty performing daily activities due to her respiratory symptoms.

**History of Present Illness (HPI):**
The patient's symptoms began approximately 7 days ago, worsening gradually over time. She described her breathing as labored and reported experiencing orthopnea (shortness of breath while lying down) and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (waking up with difficulty breathing at night). The patient also mentioned feeling lightheaded upon standing and experiencing a decrease in her usual level of activity.

**Physical Examination Findings:**
Given the patient's age and severity level, a thorough physical examination was performed to assess for potential underlying causes. Vital signs revealed a blood pressure of 160/90 mmHg, pulse of 110 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on room air. The patient's lungs were clear to auscultation, but there was evidence of bilateral crackles bilaterally in the lower lung fields. Cardiac examination revealed a grade 3/6 systolic murmur best heard at the left sternal border.

**Assessment / Diagnosis:**
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with possible pulmonary embolism was made. The patient's age and comorbidities also raised concerns for other potential causes, including pneumonia or cardiac disease.

**Plan / Treatment:**
The patient was started on oxygen therapy via nasal cannula at 2 liters per minute and prescribed oral corticosteroids (prednisone) 40 mg daily for 7-10 days. She was also ordered a chest radiograph to rule out pneumonia, and an echocardiogram to assess cardiac function. The patient's family was advised to monitor her oxygen saturation levels closely and seek immediate medical attention if she experiences any worsening of symptoms.

**Follow-up Instructions:**
The patient is scheduled for follow-up in 2 weeks to reassess her condition and adjust treatment as needed. Her family was instructed to contact the clinic immediately if they notice any signs of respiratory distress, such as difficulty breathing or chest pain.
