Location: Huittinen Clinic

Patient Information:
Female, 84 years of age

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with complaints of worsening shortness of breath and fatigue over the past week, which has significantly impacted her daily activities.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient reported a gradual increase in dyspnea, particularly upon exertion, and an overall feeling of exhaustion. She also mentioned experiencing orthopnea, where she feels short of breath while lying down. The patient's symptoms worsened over the past week, leading her to seek medical attention.

Physical Examination Findings:
Given the patient's age and severity level (5), a thorough physical examination was conducted with caution to avoid exacerbating any potential underlying conditions. Vital signs were stable, with a blood pressure of 140/80 mmHg, pulse of 88 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. The patient exhibited signs of frailty, including decreased muscle mass and poor skin turgor. A thorough examination revealed no acute abnormalities, but the patient's respiratory status was closely monitored due to her symptoms.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
Based on the patient's history and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of chronic heart failure with exacerbation was made. The patient's age and comorbidities (hypertension, hyperlipidemia) also contributed to this assessment.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient was started on 25 mg of spironolactone daily for its diuretic properties and to alleviate symptoms of heart failure. She was also prescribed 500 mg of lisinopril twice daily to manage hypertension. The patient's oxygen saturation levels were closely monitored, and supplemental oxygen was administered as needed.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient is scheduled for a follow-up appointment in two weeks to reassess her condition and adjust medications as necessary. It is essential that she adheres to her medication regimen and reports any changes in symptoms or worsening of shortness of breath promptly. The patient's family members were educated on recognizing signs of acute decompensation, such as increased dyspnea, orthopnea, and fatigue.

Discharge Instructions:
The patient was advised to maintain a regular exercise routine, including gentle stretching exercises, to improve overall cardiovascular health. She was also instructed to monitor her fluid intake and report any changes in urine output or swelling.
