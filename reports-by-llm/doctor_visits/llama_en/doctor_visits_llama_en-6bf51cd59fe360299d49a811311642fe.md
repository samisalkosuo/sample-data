**Date:** March 8, 2024
**Location:** Teuva Clinic
**Severity Level:** 4 (Less-urgent â€“ stable, 1 resource)

**Patient Information:**
Female patient, age 86

**Chief Complaint:**
The patient presented with complaints of worsening shortness of breath and fatigue over the past week.

**History of Present Illness (HPI):**
The patient reported that her shortness of breath worsened over the past few days, making it difficult for her to perform daily activities such as dressing and grooming. She also experienced increased fatigue, which has been persistent since the onset of her breathing difficulties. The patient denied any recent travel or exposure to new environments that could have triggered these symptoms.

**Physical Examination Findings:**
Given the patient's age and severity level, a thorough physical examination was conducted with caution to avoid exacerbating any potential underlying conditions. Vital signs were within normal limits, but oxygen saturation was slightly low at 92% on room air. The patient's respiratory rate was elevated at 24 breaths per minute. A chest radiograph (CXR) was ordered to assess for any pulmonary complications.

**Assessment / Diagnosis:**
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation with mild hypoxemia was made. The patient's age and comorbidities also contributed to the severity of her condition.

**Plan / Treatment:**
The patient was prescribed oxygen therapy via nasal cannula at 2 liters per minute, with a target saturation range of 88-92%. She was also started on a short-course inhalation therapy regimen consisting of albuterol and ipratropium bromide. The patient's family member was educated on the importance of monitoring her oxygen levels and reporting any changes to the healthcare provider.

**Follow-up Instructions:**
The patient is scheduled for follow-up in 2 weeks to reassess her condition and adjust treatment as needed. Her family member will be contacted to schedule a follow-up appointment if there are any concerns or changes in the patient's symptoms.

**Additional Notes:**

* The patient's family member was advised to monitor her oxygen levels closely and report any changes to the healthcare provider.
* A home oxygen therapy setup will be provided for the patient to use at home, with regular checks by a respiratory therapist.
* The patient's primary care physician will be notified of this visit and treatment plan.
