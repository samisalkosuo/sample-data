Date: 30.09.2023
Location: Kumlinge Clinic

Patient Information:
Male, 70 years old

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with complaints of progressive shortness of breath and fatigue over the past week, which worsened over the weekend.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient reported experiencing increasing difficulty breathing during exertion, particularly when walking or climbing stairs. He also mentioned feeling weak and tired, even after resting for extended periods. The symptoms began approximately 7-10 days ago and have progressively worsened. The patient denied any recent respiratory infections, allergies, or exposure to environmental toxins.

Physical Examination Findings:
Given the severity level of 2 (Emergent â€“ potential life threat), a thorough physical examination was performed. Vital signs revealed a blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg, pulse rate of 100 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on room air. The patient's respiratory rate was 24 breaths per minute, with a slightly increased work of breathing. Lung sounds were clear bilaterally, but there was a mild wheeze heard in the right lower lung field.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation is suspected. The patient's age, smoking history, and progressive worsening of symptoms support this diagnosis. Further testing, including spirometry and possibly a chest X-ray, may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient was prescribed a short-course inhaler therapy with bronchodilators (albuterol) and corticosteroids (fluticasone). He was also advised to use oxygen therapy as needed, with an initial flow rate of 2 liters per minute. The patient's doctor recommended that he avoid strenuous activities for the next few days and follow up in 1-2 weeks for further evaluation.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient is scheduled to follow up with his primary care physician in 1 week to reassess his symptoms and adjust treatment as needed. In the meantime, he should continue to use his inhaler therapy as prescribed and report any worsening of symptoms or concerns to his doctor immediately.

Discharge Summary:
The patient was discharged home with instructions for oxygen therapy and medication management. His family members were educated on how to administer oxygen and recognize signs of worsening COPD exacerbation.
