**Visit Summary**

**Date:** January 7, 2024
**Location:** Ylöjärvi Clinic
**Severity Level:** 2 (Emergent – potential life threat)

**Patient Information:**
Male patient, age 9 years.

**Chief Complaint:**
The patient presented with a 2-day history of worsening abdominal pain and vomiting, which has led to dehydration and lethargy. The patient's parents reported that the child had been playing outside without proper hydration, leading to an increase in symptoms.

**History of Present Illness (HPI):**
The patient's abdominal pain began as mild discomfort but gradually worsened over the past 2 days. Vomiting has become more frequent and persistent, with episodes occurring every 30 minutes. The child has also exhibited signs of dehydration, including dry mouth, decreased urine output, and sunken eyes. Lethargy is a significant concern, as the patient has shown decreased responsiveness to stimuli.

**Physical Examination Findings:**
Given the severity level of 2, the physical examination was focused on assessing for potential life-threatening conditions while also evaluating the child's overall condition. Vital signs revealed tachycardia (heart rate 120 bpm) and mild hypotension (blood pressure 80/40 mmHg). The patient's abdomen is tender to palpation, with guarding present in the right lower quadrant. The skin is dry and cool to the touch, consistent with dehydration.

**Assessment / Diagnosis:**
Based on the clinical presentation, a diagnosis of acute gastroenteritis with dehydration and potential for complications (e.g., electrolyte imbalance) was made. Given the patient's age and severity level, it is essential to closely monitor vital signs and adjust treatment as needed.

**Plan / Treatment:**
The patient will receive intravenous fluids (normal saline and potassium chloride) to correct dehydration and electrolyte imbalances. Antibiotics will be administered to cover for potential bacterial causes of gastroenteritis. The child will also receive antiemetic medication to manage vomiting. Close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory results, and stool quality is essential.

**Follow-up Instructions:**
The patient will require close follow-up in 2 hours to assess for improvement or worsening of symptoms. If the patient's condition does not improve, a return visit to the clinic within 24 hours is expected. The child's parents are advised to seek immediate medical attention if they notice any signs of severe dehydration (e.g., seizures, altered mental status), bloody stools, or difficulty breathing.

**Additional Notes:**
The patient will be closely monitored for potential complications, including electrolyte imbalances and bacterial infections. The child's parents have been educated on proper hydration techniques and the importance of following up with clinic appointments to ensure optimal recovery.
