The patient presented with complaints of worsening shortness of breath and fatigue over the past week. He reported difficulty breathing during exertion and an increase in coughing at night.

**History of Present Illness (HPI):**
The patient's symptoms began approximately two weeks ago, following a recent hospitalization for pneumonia. Since then, his condition has progressively worsened, with increasing shortness of breath and fatigue.

The patient will be prescribed inhalational corticosteroids (fluticasone) via metered-dose inhaler (MDI), as well as a bronchodilator (albuterol) for symptom relief. The patient is also advised to use a humidifier in his home to help manage his symptoms. A follow-up appointment will be scheduled in one week to reassess the patient's condition.

**Follow-up Instructions:**
The patient should return to the clinic in one week for a follow-up appointment, where his medication regimen and any changes to his treatment plan will be discussed.
