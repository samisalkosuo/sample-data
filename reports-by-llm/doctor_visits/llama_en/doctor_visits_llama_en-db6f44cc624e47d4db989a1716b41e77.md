**Visit Summary**

**Date:** December 26, 2023
**Location:** Finstr√∂m Clinic
**Patient Information:**
- **Gender:** Male
- **Age:** 83 years

**Chief Complaint:**
The patient presented with complaints of worsening shortness of breath and fatigue over the past week.

**History of Present Illness (HPI):**
The patient reported a gradual increase in dyspnea, particularly on exertion, which has worsened over the past week. He also mentioned feeling increasingly fatigued, even when resting, and experiencing mild chest discomfort that radiates to his back. The symptoms began approximately 2 weeks ago, following an episode of pneumonia treated at home with antibiotics.

**Physical Examination Findings:**
Given the patient's age and severity level (1), a thorough but expedited examination was conducted. Vital signs revealed tachypnea (24 breaths/min) and mild tachycardia (120 beats/min). The patient appeared anxious but calm, with no acute distress. Oxygen saturation was 92% on room air. The lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally. Cardiac examination revealed a regular rhythm without murmurs or gallops.

**Assessment / Diagnosis:**
The clinical presentation is concerning for an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with possible superimposed pneumonia, given the patient's history and symptoms. The presence of tachypnea, dyspnea on exertion, and chest discomfort suggests a need for immediate evaluation and potential oxygen therapy.

**Plan / Treatment:**
- **Oxygen Therapy:** Administer supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula at 4 liters per minute to improve oxygen saturation.
- **Corticosteroids:** Prescribe prednisone 40 mg orally once daily for 3 days to reduce inflammation in the lungs.
- **Antibiotics:** Continue antibiotics prescribed previously, pending culture results, and adjust as necessary based on clinical response.
- **Monitoring:** Order a chest X-ray within 24 hours to assess lung status and guide further management.

**Follow-up Instructions:**
Schedule a follow-up appointment for 2 days post-discharge to reassess the patient's condition and adjust treatment plan as needed. The patient is advised to contact the clinic immediately if symptoms worsen or if they experience any signs of respiratory distress.

The patient was discharged home with instructions on oxygen therapy, medication adherence, and follow-up appointments.
