Patient Information:
- Gender: Female
- Age: 17 years

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with complaints of worsening abdominal pain and nausea, which started 2 days ago.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient reported a gradual increase in abdominal pain, initially localized to the right lower quadrant. Over the past 24 hours, the pain has intensified, becoming more diffuse and radiating to the back. Nausea and vomiting have also developed, with episodes occurring several times a day. The patient has experienced no fever or changes in bowel habits. She reported that her symptoms worsened after consuming a large meal at a social gathering.

Physical Examination Findings:
Given the severity of this case (4), the physical examination was focused on assessing for signs of peritonitis, dehydration, and potential organ involvement. The patient appeared pale with slight tachycardia (120 bpm). Abdominal tenderness was noted in all quadrants, with a focus on the right lower quadrant where pain is most pronounced. Rebound tenderness was present, indicating possible peritoneal irritation. The patient's vital signs were stable but showed signs of mild dehydration (mild tachycardia and decreased urine output). No fever or significant abdominal masses were detected.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
Based on the clinical presentation, the patient is suspected to have acute appendicitis with potential complications such as peritonitis. The severity level of 4 indicates a high risk for complications if not promptly treated.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient was admitted for observation and treatment. She received intravenous fluids to correct dehydration and antibiotics to cover for possible bacterial infection. An ultrasound is planned for the next day to confirm the diagnosis and assess for any complications such as abscess formation or bowel obstruction. The patient will be closely monitored for signs of peritonitis, sepsis, or worsening abdominal pain.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient will be seen in the clinic on 25.02.2024 for a follow-up ultrasound to confirm the diagnosis and assess for any complications. She is advised to rest at home, avoid strenuous activities, and follow a bland diet until further notice. The patient's family has been instructed on how to manage her symptoms and recognize signs of worsening condition.

Discharge Instructions:
The patient was discharged with instructions to return to the clinic if she experiences any increase in pain, fever, or vomiting.
