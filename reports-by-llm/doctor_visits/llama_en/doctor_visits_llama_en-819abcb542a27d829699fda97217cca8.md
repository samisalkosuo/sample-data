Patient Information:
Female patient, age 44

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with complaints of worsening back pain and stiffness over the past few weeks, which has significantly impacted her daily activities.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient reported a gradual increase in back pain, starting from mild discomfort to moderate severity. She described the pain as a dull ache, primarily located in the lower back region. The pain is exacerbated by movement and relieved by rest. Over the past week, she has experienced increased stiffness and limited mobility due to the pain. The patient also reported occasional episodes of numbness and tingling in her legs.

Physical Examination Findings:
Given the severity level of 2 (Emergent â€“ potential life threat), a thorough physical examination was performed. The patient's vital signs were stable, with a blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg, heart rate of 72 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient exhibited tenderness in the lower back region, particularly upon palpation. Muscle strength was decreased in the affected area, and reflexes were slightly diminished.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of lumbar spondylosis with possible nerve root compression is suspected. The patient's age and gender are consistent with this condition, which often affects individuals between 40-60 years old.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient was prescribed:

* Ibuprofen 400mg orally twice daily for pain management
* Physical therapy to improve mobility and strength in the affected area
* A referral to a specialist for further evaluation and potential surgical intervention

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient is advised to follow up with her primary care physician in two weeks to reassess her condition. She should also attend scheduled physical therapy sessions and report any changes in symptoms or pain levels.

It is essential to note that the severity level of 2 indicates a potential life-threatening situation, and further evaluation by a specialist may be necessary to determine the best course of treatment.
