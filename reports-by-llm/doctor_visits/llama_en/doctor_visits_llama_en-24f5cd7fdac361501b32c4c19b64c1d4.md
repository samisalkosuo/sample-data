**Visit Summary**

**Date:** 23.09.2023
**Location:** Kauhajoki Clinic

**Patient Information:**
- **Gender:** Male
- **Age:** 78 years old

**Chief Complaint:**
The patient presented with complaints of worsening shortness of breath and fatigue over the past week, which has significantly impacted his daily activities.

**History of Present Illness (HPI):**
The patient reported a gradual increase in dyspnea (shortness of breath) and fatigue, particularly after minimal exertion. He also mentioned an inability to perform his usual activities without feeling winded. The symptoms worsened over the past week, leading him to seek medical attention.

**Physical Examination Findings:**
Given the severity level of 5, indicating a non-urgent situation but still requiring attention due to its impact on quality of life, the physical examination was focused on assessing the patient's overall condition and potential contributing factors. The patient appeared frail with signs of dehydration (dry mouth, slightly decreased urine output). His oxygen saturation levels were within normal limits, but his respiratory rate was elevated at 24 breaths per minute.

**Assessment / Diagnosis:**
The patient's presentation is suggestive of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation. The symptoms are consistent with a worsening of his underlying condition, likely exacerbated by environmental factors or possible medication non-adherence. Further evaluation would be necessary to confirm this diagnosis and assess the need for any additional interventions.

**Plan / Treatment:**
- **Medications:** The patient was prescribed a short-course inhaler (e.g., salbutamol) to help manage his symptoms temporarily, with instructions to use it as directed by his pharmacist. A follow-up appointment will be scheduled to reassess his condition and adjust the treatment plan if necessary.
- **Lifestyle Modifications:** The patient was advised on the importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle, including regular exercise (if feasible), smoking cessation, and avoiding exposure to pollutants.

**Follow-up Instructions:**
The patient is scheduled for follow-up in two weeks. During this appointment, his condition will be reassessed, and any necessary adjustments to his treatment plan will be made. The patient was also advised on the importance of monitoring his symptoms closely between appointments and contacting the clinic if they worsen or do not improve with treatment.

**Additional Notes:**
Given the patient's age and overall health status, it is crucial that he adheres strictly to his medication regimen and lifestyle modifications to prevent further exacerbations. Regular follow-ups will be necessary to monitor his condition and adjust the treatment plan as needed.
