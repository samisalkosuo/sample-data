**Visit Summary**

**Date:** 19.04.2024
**Location:** Ikaalinen Clinic
**Severity Level:** 3 (Urgent)

**Patient Information:**
Female patient, age 2 years.

**Chief Complaint:**
The patient's mother reported a 2-day history of fever, vomiting, and refusal to drink fluids in the child. The mother also mentioned that the child has been experiencing irritability and lethargy over the past 24 hours.

**History of Present Illness (HPI):**
The patient was brought to the clinic by her mother due to concerns about her worsening condition. Over the past 2 days, the patient has had a high fever, which has been accompanied by vomiting and refusal to drink fluids. The child's irritability and lethargy have worsened over the past 24 hours, making it difficult for her to interact with her surroundings. The mother reported that the child's stool and urine output have decreased significantly.

**Physical Examination Findings:**
Given the patient's age and severity level, a thorough physical examination was performed. The patient appeared lethargic and irritable, with a temperature of 39Â°C. Her skin was dry and cool to the touch. The lungs were clear, and the abdomen was soft and non-tender. The child's vital signs showed a heart rate of 120 bpm, blood pressure 80/60 mmHg, and oxygen saturation 92% on room air.

**Assessment / Diagnosis:**
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of viral gastroenteritis with dehydration was made. The high fever, vomiting, and refusal to drink fluids suggest a severe case of gastroenteritis, which requires close monitoring and aggressive fluid replacement.

**Plan / Treatment:**
The patient was started on intravenous fluids (0.9% saline) at 20 mL/kg/hour, with a goal of maintaining a urine output of at least 1 mL/kg/hour. Oral rehydration solution was also administered to help manage the child's dehydration. The patient was prescribed acetaminophen for fever management and anti-diarrheal medication to reduce stool frequency.

**Follow-up Instructions:**
The patient will be followed up in 24 hours to assess her response to treatment and adjust fluid replacement as needed. The mother is advised to continue administering oral rehydration solution and to monitor the child's urine output closely. If the child's condition worsens or shows signs of sepsis (e.g., increased temperature, decreased urine output, or lethargy), she should seek immediate medical attention.

**Additional Notes:**
The patient will require close monitoring for signs of dehydration and electrolyte imbalances. The mother is advised to report any changes in the child's condition to the clinic promptly.
