Location: Parikkala Clinic

Patient Information:
- Gender: Male
- Age: 44

Severity Level: 5 (Non-urgent â€“ minor complaints)

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with a complaint of mild, persistent fatigue and generalized weakness over the past week.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient reported feeling tired and lacking energy, even after getting adequate rest. He also mentioned experiencing mild muscle cramps during physical activity. The symptoms started approximately 7 days ago and have been gradually worsening. There is no significant weight loss or fever associated with these complaints.

Physical Examination Findings:
Given the severity level of this case, a thorough examination was conducted to rule out any underlying conditions that could be contributing to the patient's symptoms. Vital signs were within normal limits (blood pressure 120/80 mmHg, pulse 72 beats per minute, respiratory rate 12 breaths per minute). The patient's skin appeared healthy and well-hydrated. A general physical examination revealed no abnormalities in the musculoskeletal or cardiovascular systems.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
Based on the patient's symptoms and the results of the physical examination, it is likely that the patient has a mild case of anemia, possibly due to iron deficiency. The fatigue and muscle cramps are consistent with this diagnosis. Further testing may be necessary to confirm the presence of anemia and rule out other potential causes.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient was prescribed ferrous sulfate 500 mg orally once daily for 2 weeks to address the suspected iron deficiency anemia. It is essential that the patient adheres to the medication regimen as directed by the physician. The patient should also consider increasing their dietary intake of iron-rich foods, such as red meat, spinach, and fortified cereals.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient will be scheduled for a follow-up appointment in 2 weeks to assess the effectiveness of the treatment plan and monitor any changes in symptoms. In the meantime, if the patient experiences worsening fatigue or muscle cramps, they should contact their physician immediately.
