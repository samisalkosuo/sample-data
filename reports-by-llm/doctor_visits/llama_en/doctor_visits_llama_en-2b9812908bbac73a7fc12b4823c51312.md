**History of Present Illness (HPI):**
The patient's symptoms began 48 hours ago, after he experienced a minor fall at home. He was able to return to his usual activities without significant distress. However, over the past 24 hours, his discomfort has worsened, and he has noticed an increase in coughing fits.

The lungs were clear to auscultation, and the chest was slightly tender to palpation over the left lower quadrant. The cardiac examination revealed no significant abnormalities.

**Assessment / Diagnosis:**
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of acute bronchitis is suspected. Given the patient's age and underlying health conditions (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), it is essential to monitor his condition closely.

**Plan / Treatment:**
The patient will be prescribed a 7-day course of azithromycin 500 mg orally once daily, starting immediately. He will also receive instructions on proper coughing techniques and the importance of staying hydrated. The patient's family members will need to monitor his symptoms and report any changes or concerns to the clinic.

**Follow-up Instructions:**
The patient is scheduled for a follow-up appointment in 2 weeks to reassess his condition. In the meantime, he should contact the clinic if his symptoms worsen or if he experiences difficulty breathing, chest pain, or severe coughing fits.

**Additional Notes:**

* The patient's family members will need to assist him with daily activities and provide emotional support during this time.
* It is essential to ensure the patient adheres to his medication regimen and follows proper self-care instructions to prevent complications.
