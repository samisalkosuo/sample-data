Visit Summary:

Patient Information:
------------------

* Name: Mr. Juhani Kalle
* Date of Birth: 12.02.1952
* Gender: Male
* Age: 81 years

Visit Details:
-----------------

* Visit Date: February 11, 2023
* Clinic/Hospital Location: Loimaa Clinic

Chief Complaint:
----------------

Mr. Kalle presented with a complaint of worsening shortness of breath over the past week, which has progressively increased in severity.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
---------------------------------

The patient reported that he had been experiencing mild to moderate dyspnea on exertion for several days, which initially improved with rest but worsened over time. He also mentioned a feeling of fatigue and mild chest discomfort. The symptoms have been exacerbated by physical activity and have not responded well to over-the-counter medications.

Physical Examination Findings:
------------------------------

Given the patient's age and severity level (5), a thorough examination was conducted to assess his overall health status. Vital signs were within normal limits, with a blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg and a pulse rate of 80 beats per minute. The respiratory rate was 18 breaths per minute, which is slightly elevated.

A chest examination revealed bilateral wheezes and mild crackles in the lungs, consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient's oxygen saturation levels were 92% on room air, indicating mild hypoxemia.

Assessment/Diagnosis:
----------------------

Based on the patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, and medical history, a diagnosis of exacerbation of COPD was made. The patient's age and comorbidities (e.g., hypertension, hyperlipidemia) also contributed to his overall health status.

Plan/Treatment:
-----------------

The patient was prescribed:

* Inhaled corticosteroids (fluticasone) 500 mcg via metered-dose inhaler twice daily
* Bronchodilator (salbutamol) 2 puffs via inhaler as needed for symptoms
* Antibiotics (amoxicillin-clavulanate) 500 mg orally twice daily for 7-10 days to treat a possible respiratory infection

Follow-up Instructions:
-------------------------

The patient is advised to follow up with the clinic in 2 weeks to reassess his condition and adjust treatment as necessary. In the meantime, he should:

* Continue to use his inhaler as prescribed
* Avoid strenuous physical activity until symptoms improve
* Monitor his oxygen saturation levels and report any changes to the clinic

It is also essential for Mr. Kalle to maintain good lung hygiene, including regular cleaning of his home environment and avoiding exposure to secondhand smoke.

By following these instructions, we aim to manage Mr. Kalle's COPD exacerbation effectively and improve his overall quality of life.
