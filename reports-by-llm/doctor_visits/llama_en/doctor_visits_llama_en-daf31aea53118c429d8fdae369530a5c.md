Patient Information:
Gender: Female
Age: 18 years

Severity Level: 3 (Urgent)

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with a 2-day history of worsening abdominal pain, accompanied by nausea and vomiting. She reported that the pain is more pronounced after meals and has increased in intensity over the past 24 hours.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient's symptoms began on the third day of a recent gastrointestinal illness, which she had been experiencing for several days prior to the onset of abdominal pain. The pain is described as sharp and stabbing, located in the lower right quadrant of her abdomen. She reports that the pain is exacerbated by movement and relieved by leaning forward. Vomiting has been present since the onset of pain, with episodes occurring 2-3 times a day.

Physical Examination Findings:
The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg, pulse of 90 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. The abdomen is tender to palpation in the lower right quadrant, with guarding present. Rebound tenderness is noted. The rest of the physical examination is unremarkable.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of acute appendicitis is suspected. The severity level of 3 indicates that while the patient is stable, she requires prompt evaluation and treatment to prevent complications.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient will undergo immediate imaging studies (CT scan or ultrasound) to confirm the diagnosis and assess for any potential complications. She will be started on antibiotics (e.g., ciprofloxacin and metronidazole) to cover for possible bacterial overgrowth. The patient will also receive pain management with acetaminophen and ibuprofen as needed.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient is scheduled for follow-up in 2-3 days to assess for resolution of symptoms and to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment. She should return to the clinic if her symptoms worsen or if she experiences any signs of sepsis (e.g., fever, chills, tachycardia).
