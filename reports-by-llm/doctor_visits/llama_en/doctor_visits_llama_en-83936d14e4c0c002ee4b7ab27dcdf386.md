Date: October 8, 2024
Location: Myrskylä Clinic

Patient Information:
Gender: Female
Age: 28

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with complaints of worsening fatigue and shortness of breath over the past week, which has significantly impacted her daily activities.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient reported a gradual increase in fatigue, particularly after physical exertion, which has worsened over the past week. She also experiences shortness of breath during periods of increased activity or at rest. The patient denies any chest pain, cough, or fever. Her symptoms have been exacerbated by stress and lack of sleep.

Physical Examination Findings:
Given the severity level of 2 (Emergent – potential life threat), a thorough physical examination was performed to assess for any underlying causes of her symptoms. Vital signs were within normal limits, with a blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg, pulse of 100 bpm, and oxygen saturation of 95% on room air. The patient's lungs were clear to auscultation, and the cardiac exam was unremarkable. However, upon further examination, a mild bilateral wheeze was noted, consistent with her symptoms.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
Based on the patient's presentation and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of asthma exacerbation is suspected. Further testing, including spirometry, may be necessary to confirm this diagnosis.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient will be prescribed a short-course of inhaled corticosteroids (fluticasone) via metered-dose inhaler (MDI), which will be available for pickup at the clinic. She will also receive instructions on proper use and dosing. Additionally, the patient will be advised to carry an inhaler with her at all times and to seek immediate medical attention if symptoms worsen or do not improve with treatment.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient is scheduled for a follow-up appointment in 2 weeks to reassess her symptoms and adjust medication as needed. She should return to the clinic if she experiences any worsening of symptoms, such as increased shortness of breath, chest tightness, or coughing up blood.
