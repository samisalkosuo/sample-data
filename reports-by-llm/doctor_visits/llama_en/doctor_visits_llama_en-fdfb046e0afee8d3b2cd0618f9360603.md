**Visit Summary**

**Date:** June 7, 2025
**Location:** Taipalsaari Clinic
**Severity Level:** 4 (Less-urgent – stable, 1 resource)

**Patient Information:**
Female patient, age 4 years.

**Chief Complaint:**
The patient's mother reported a 2-day history of fever, vomiting, and abdominal pain in her child. The mother also mentioned that the child has been having difficulty sleeping and seems lethargic.

**History of Present Illness (HPI):**
The patient was brought to the clinic by her mother due to concerns about her child's symptoms. Upon examination, the patient appeared irritable and fussy, with a temperature of 38.5°C. The abdomen was tender to palpation, particularly in the right lower quadrant. The patient had been vomiting once during the day, but no blood or bile was present. She had also experienced some diarrhea, which was described as "watery" by her mother.

**Physical Examination Findings:**
Given the severity level of 4, the physical examination findings were focused on assessing the patient's overall condition and identifying any potential complications. The patient was found to be slightly dehydrated, with a decreased urine output. The abdomen was tender to palpation, but no guarding or rebound tenderness was noted. The lungs were clear to auscultation, and there was no evidence of respiratory distress.

**Assessment / Diagnosis:**
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of viral gastroenteritis (VGE) was made. The presence of fever, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea suggested an infectious etiology. The patient's age and presentation were consistent with a viral cause, such as rotavirus or norovirus.

**Plan / Treatment:**
The patient was prescribed oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to manage dehydration and electrolyte imbalances. She was also given acetaminophen for fever reduction and anti-diarrheal medication to slow bowel movements. The mother was advised to monitor the patient's symptoms closely and seek immediate attention if they worsened or if the patient showed signs of dehydration, such as excessive thirst, dark urine, or decreased urine output.

**Follow-up Instructions:**
The patient is scheduled for a follow-up appointment in 2 days to reassess her condition. The mother was advised to continue monitoring the patient's symptoms and to seek immediate attention at the clinic if any of the following occur:

* Fever above 39°C
* Vomiting blood or bile
* Diarrhea that lasts more than 3 days
* Signs of dehydration, such as excessive thirst, dark urine, or decreased urine output

The mother was also advised to keep the patient home from school until she is feeling better and has been symptom-free for at least 24 hours.
