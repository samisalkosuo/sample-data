Visit Summary:

Date: 18.03.2025
Location: Sulkava Clinic

Patient Information:
Female, 71 years old

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with complaints of worsening shortness of breath and fatigue over the past week, which have progressively worsened her ability to perform daily activities.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient reported a gradual increase in dyspnea, particularly upon exertion, and an overall feeling of exhaustion. She also mentioned experiencing orthopnea, where she feels short of breath when lying down. The patient's symptoms have been exacerbated by a recent episode of pneumonia 6 months ago, which was treated with antibiotics and supportive care. She has not experienced any chest pain or coughing up blood.

Physical Examination Findings:
Given the severity level of 5, the physical examination was focused on assessing the patient's overall condition and monitoring her oxygen saturation levels. The patient appeared pale and slightly short of breath, but vital signs were stable. Oxygen saturation levels were 92% on room air, which is within normal limits. The patient's lungs were clear to auscultation, and there were no signs of consolidation or edema.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
Based on the patient's history and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation was made. The patient's symptoms are consistent with a worsening of her underlying COPD, which is likely exacerbated by her recent pneumonia episode.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient will be started on oral corticosteroids 40mg daily for 5 days to reduce inflammation and improve lung function. She will also receive oxygen therapy via nasal cannula at 2L/min to help increase oxygen saturation levels. The patient's antibiotics from the previous pneumonia episode will be restarted, as they are likely still effective against her current infection.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient is scheduled for follow-up in 1 week to reassess her symptoms and adjust her treatment plan as needed. She should return to the clinic if she experiences any worsening of her symptoms or if she requires additional oxygen therapy. The patient's family members should be educated on recognizing signs of respiratory distress and seeking immediate medical attention if they occur.

Note: Due to the severity level, the patient was closely monitored during the visit, and her oxygen saturation levels were frequently checked to ensure that she remained stable.
