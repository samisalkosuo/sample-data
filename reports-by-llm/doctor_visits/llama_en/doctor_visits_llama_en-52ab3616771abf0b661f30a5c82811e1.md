**Visit Summary**

**Date:** December 11, 2023

**Location:** Eckerö Clinic

**Patient Information:**
- **Gender:** Male
- **Age:** 87 years old

**Chief Complaint:**
The patient presented with complaints of worsening shortness of breath and fatigue over the past week. He reported difficulty breathing during exertion and an increase in oxygen requirements at home.

**History of Present Illness (HPI):**
The patient's symptoms began approximately two weeks ago, following a recent hospitalization for pneumonia. Since then, his condition has progressively worsened, with increasing shortness of breath and fatigue. The patient reports feeling tired even after resting and is unable to perform daily activities without significant discomfort.

**Physical Examination Findings:**
Given the severity level of 5 (Non-urgent – minor complaints), the physical examination was relatively unremarkable. Vital signs were stable, with a blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg, heart rate of 80 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. The patient's lungs were clear to auscultation, and there were no signs of acute distress.

**Assessment / Diagnosis:**
The patient's symptoms are consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation. Given his age and history of pneumonia, it is likely that the current episode is related to his underlying COPD rather than a new infection. Further testing may be necessary to confirm this diagnosis.

**Plan / Treatment:**
- The patient will be started on a short-course of oral corticosteroids (prednisone) to help manage inflammation and improve lung function.
- A follow-up appointment with the pulmonologist is scheduled for one week from today to monitor the patient's response to treatment and adjust as necessary.
- The patient is advised to continue using his inhaler as prescribed and to avoid strenuous activities until further notice.

**Follow-up Instructions:**
The patient should return to the clinic in one week for a follow-up appointment with the pulmonologist. In the meantime, if symptoms worsen or do not improve with treatment, he should contact the clinic immediately. The patient is also advised to keep track of his oxygen levels and report any changes to the healthcare provider.

**Additional Notes:**
The patient's family has been informed of his condition and will be contacted in case of any changes in his status.
