Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with complaints of worsening back pain and fatigue over the past week, which has significantly impacted his daily activities.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient reported a gradual increase in lower back pain, radiating to his left buttock, accompanied by morning stiffness. He also experienced fatigue, particularly after physical activity, and reported difficulty sleeping due to discomfort. The pain worsened over the past few days, prompting him to seek medical attention.

Physical Examination Findings:
Given the severity level of 4, the patient's presentation was assessed as stable but requiring additional resources for management. Vital signs were within normal limits. On examination, tenderness was noted in the left lumbar region, and the patient exhibited limited range of motion in his lower back. No neurological deficits or systemic symptoms were observed.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
The patient's symptoms are consistent with chronic lower back pain, likely related to musculoskeletal strain. Further evaluation is recommended to rule out any underlying conditions that may be contributing to his symptoms.

Plan / Treatment:
A comprehensive physical therapy assessment will be conducted to address the patient's mobility and strength issues. The patient will be prescribed a course of analgesics for pain management and advised on proper posture and lifting techniques to alleviate strain on his back. A referral to an orthopedic specialist will be made for further evaluation and potential treatment.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient is scheduled for follow-up in two weeks to reassess his condition and adjust the treatment plan as needed. In the meantime, he is advised to maintain a regular exercise routine, including stretching and strengthening exercises, to improve mobility and reduce pain.

Note: The severity level of 4 indicates that while the patient's condition is not immediately life-threatening, it requires additional resources for management and follow-up appointments to monitor progress.
