The patient reported that she first noticed an increase in her lower back pain about two months ago.

Her vital signs were stable, but she exhibited significant fatigue, which was noted during the assessment.

**Assessment/Diagnosis:**
Based on the patient's history of present illness and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of chronic low back pain with associated fatigue is considered.

The patient was prescribed:
- **Muscle relaxants:** To help manage muscle spasms and alleviate pain.
- **Pain relievers:** Over-the-counter analgesics for acute pain management.
- **Physical therapy referral:** To address the chronic nature of her back pain through a structured exercise program.

**Follow-up Instructions:**
The patient is advised to follow up in two weeks to assess the effectiveness of the prescribed treatments and adjust as necessary. She should also continue with her physical therapy sessions, which will be scheduled at the clinic.

**Additional Notes:** The patient was educated on proper posture, lifting techniques, and exercises to strengthen her back muscles. It is recommended that she maintains a healthy lifestyle, including regular exercise and a balanced diet, to manage chronic pain effectively.
