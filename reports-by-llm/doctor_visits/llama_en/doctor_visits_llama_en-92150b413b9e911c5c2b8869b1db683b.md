**Visit Summary**

**Date:** November 4, 2024
**Location:** Janakkala Clinic
**Severity Level:** 3 (Urgent - stable, needs 2+ resources)

**Patient Information:**
- Gender: Male
- Age: 17 years old

**Chief Complaint:**
The patient presented with a complaint of worsening abdominal pain and nausea over the past two days.

**History of Present Illness (HPI):**
The patient reported that his symptoms started after consuming a large amount of spicy food at a friend's gathering. The pain initially subsided but has progressively worsened, becoming more severe and localized to the right lower quadrant. He also experienced nausea and vomiting, which have been accompanied by mild fever. The patient denied any recent travel or exposure to infectious agents.

**Physical Examination Findings:**
Given the severity level of 3, the physical examination was focused on assessing for signs of peritonitis, dehydration, and potential complications such as appendicitis. The patient presented with tenderness in the right lower quadrant, guarding (muscle tension), and a slightly elevated temperature of 38.5°C. His abdomen was also slightly distended.

**Assessment / Diagnosis:**
Based on the clinical presentation, it is likely that the patient has acute appendicitis or another cause of peritonitis. Given his age and symptoms, further diagnostic testing such as imaging studies (e.g., ultrasound) would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential causes.

**Plan / Treatment:**
The patient was started on intravenous fluids for hydration and mild analgesics for pain management. He was also scheduled for an urgent ultrasound examination to evaluate the appendix and assess for any complications such as abscess formation or perforation. Antibiotics were prescribed based on clinical suspicion of possible bacterial infection.

**Follow-up Instructions:**
The patient is advised to follow up with the clinic in 24 hours to have the ultrasound results interpreted and to discuss further management options, including potential surgical intervention if appendicitis is confirmed. The patient should also be monitored for signs of worsening symptoms or complications such as fever above 39°C, severe abdominal pain, or vomiting blood.

**Additional Notes:**
The patient's family was educated on the importance of maintaining hydration and adhering to medication regimens. A follow-up appointment with a surgeon will be scheduled if appendicitis is confirmed.
