Patient Information:
Male patient, age 77 years

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with complaints of worsening shortness of breath and fatigue over the past week.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient reported a gradual increase in dyspnea (shortness of breath) and fatigue, which worsened over the past week. He also experienced mild chest discomfort that radiates to his left arm. The patient has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). His symptoms began after a recent increase in physical activity due to a new hobby.

Physical Examination Findings:
Given the severity level of 4, the patient's examination was focused on assessing his respiratory status. Vital signs revealed a blood pressure of 160/90 mmHg, pulse of 100 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on room air. The patient exhibited bilateral wheezes and crackles in both lungs, consistent with COPD exacerbation. His lung fields were clear to auscultation.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with a COPD exacerbation. Given his age and comorbidities, the patient is at increased risk for complications such as pneumonia or respiratory failure.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient was prescribed oral corticosteroids (prednisone 40 mg daily) to reduce inflammation and alleviate symptoms. He also received a prescription for bronchodilator inhalers (albuterol 2 puffs, 4 times daily). The patient was advised to increase fluid intake and avoid strenuous activities until his condition improves.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient is scheduled for follow-up in one week to reassess his symptoms and adjust treatment as needed. It is essential that the patient adheres to his medication regimen and follows up promptly to prevent complications.

Additional Recommendations:
Given the patient's age and comorbidities, it is crucial to monitor his oxygen saturation levels closely and consider oxygen therapy if necessary. The patient should also be educated on proper COPD management techniques, including smoking cessation and regular exercise.
