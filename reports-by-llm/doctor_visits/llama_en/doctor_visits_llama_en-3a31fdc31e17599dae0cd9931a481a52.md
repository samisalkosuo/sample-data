Date: 26.05.2024
Location: Föglö Clinic

Patient Information:
Male, 56 years old

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with complaints of progressive difficulty breathing over the past few days, which has worsened over the past 24 hours.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient reported a gradual increase in shortness of breath, particularly during exertion. He described feeling winded even when performing light activities such as walking or gardening. The symptoms started approximately 3-4 days ago and have progressively worsened. The patient also reported coughing up small amounts of rust-colored sputum.

Physical Examination Findings:
Given the severity level of 1, the patient's presentation is consistent with an immediate life-threatening situation. The patient was found to be in severe respiratory distress, requiring supplemental oxygen via non-rebreather mask. His oxygen saturation levels were low, and he exhibited signs of hypoxia. The physical examination also revealed a temperature of 38.5°C, indicating a possible infectious component.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of acute respiratory failure due to pneumonia is suspected. Further diagnostic testing, including chest radiography and sputum analysis, will be necessary to confirm this diagnosis.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics (e.g., ceftriaxone) and oxygen therapy via non-rebreather mask. He was also administered a course of corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone) to reduce inflammation in the lungs. The patient will require close monitoring for signs of respiratory failure, including hypoxemia and hypercapnia.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient is scheduled for follow-up in 24 hours to reassess his condition and adjust treatment as necessary. He should return to the clinic if he experiences worsening symptoms, such as increased shortness of breath or chest pain.
