Patient Information:
- Gender: Female
- Age: 92 years

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with complaints of progressive shortness of breath and fatigue over the past week.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient reported worsening symptoms over the past week, including difficulty breathing during exertion and increased fatigue. She also mentioned a recent increase in coughing, which has been productive but not accompanied by any significant sputum color changes or blood. The patient's oxygen saturation levels have been consistently below 90% on room air.

Physical Examination Findings:
Given the patient's age and severity level of 2 (emergent), the physical examination was focused on assessing respiratory function and potential signs of decompensation. Vital signs revealed a temperature of 98.6Â°F, blood pressure of 160/80 mmHg, pulse rate of 110 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation of 85% on room air. The patient's lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally, but there was a notable decrease in breath sounds over the left lower lung area. The patient exhibited signs of respiratory distress, including increased work of breathing and use of accessory muscles.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
The patient's presentation is consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation, likely secondary to viral infection. Given her age and severity level, it is crucial to monitor for signs of decompensation closely.

Plan / Treatment:
- The patient was started on oxygen therapy via nasal cannula at 2 liters per minute.
- She was prescribed oral corticosteroids (prednisone) 40 mg daily for 5 days.
- A follow-up appointment with the pulmonologist is scheduled for August 21, 2023.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient should return to the clinic on August 21, 2023, at 9:00 AM. She will need to bring her oxygen saturation levels and any changes in symptoms or medication side effects. The patient's family members are advised to monitor her closely for signs of respiratory distress and seek immediate medical attention if they notice any worsening symptoms.
