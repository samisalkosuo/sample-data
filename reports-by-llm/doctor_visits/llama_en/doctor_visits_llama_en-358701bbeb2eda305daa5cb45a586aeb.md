**Visit Summary**

**Date:** August 14, 2024
**Location:** Nivala Clinic
**Severity Level:** 5 (Non-urgent â€“ minor complaints)

**Patient Information:**
Male patient, age 71 years.

**Chief Complaint:**
The patient presented with a complaint of mild left-sided chest discomfort that started 2 days ago. He reported feeling a tightness in his chest and shortness of breath during light physical activity.

**History of Present Illness (HPI):**
The patient described the onset of symptoms as gradual, starting with a minor ache in his left side. Over the past 48 hours, the discomfort has worsened, but he has not experienced any significant increase in severity or difficulty breathing. He reported no fever, cough, or sputum production. The patient is a non-smoker and has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia.

**Physical Examination Findings:**
Upon examination, the patient's vital signs were within normal limits. His blood pressure was 140/90 mmHg, heart rate was 80 beats per minute, respiratory rate was 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation was 98% on room air. The physical examination revealed a slightly enlarged left supraclavicular lymph node (2 cm x 1 cm) without any other notable abnormalities.

**Assessment / Diagnosis:**
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of mild left-sided chest wall tightness or costochondritis was made. This condition is characterized by inflammation of the cartilage that connects the ribs to the sternum, leading to pain and discomfort in the affected area.

**Plan / Treatment:**
The patient will be prescribed 500 mg of ibuprofen orally twice daily for 3 days to manage pain and inflammation. A follow-up appointment will be scheduled in 2 weeks to reassess symptoms and determine if further treatment is necessary. The patient is advised to avoid heavy lifting, bending, or strenuous physical activity during this time.

**Follow-up Instructions:**
The patient should return to the clinic on August 28, 2024, for a follow-up appointment. In the meantime, he can contact the office at (555) 123-4567 if his symptoms worsen or if he experiences any difficulty breathing. It is essential to note that while this condition is typically self-limiting, it is crucial to seek immediate medical attention if symptoms worsen or if chest pain radiates to the back or arm.
