Location: Tornio Clinic

Patient Information:
Gender: Female
Age: 21 years old

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with complaints of worsening abdominal pain and nausea over the past 24 hours.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient reported a gradual increase in lower right quadrant abdominal pain, which worsened over the past day. She also experienced nausea and vomiting, particularly after meals. The pain was described as sharp and stabbing, radiating to her back. There were no fever or chills associated with her symptoms. She had been experiencing mild constipation for the past week but attributed it to a change in diet.

Physical Examination Findings:
Given the severity level of 3 (Urgent), the patient's physical examination was focused on assessing her abdominal pain and potential signs of peritonitis. The patient presented with tenderness in the lower right quadrant, which was exacerbated by movement and palpation. Rebound tenderness was noted, indicating possible peritoneal irritation. Abdominal masses were not detected. Her vital signs were stable, with a blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg, pulse of 90 beats/min, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
Based on the patient's presentation, a diagnosis of acute appendicitis was made. The presence of right lower quadrant pain, rebound tenderness, and a history of mild constipation suggested an inflammatory process in the appendix.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient was started on intravenous fluids to maintain hydration and electrolyte balance. She received broad-spectrum antibiotics (e.g., cefotaxime) to cover for potential bacterial infection. The patient was also prescribed analgesics (e.g., acetaminophen) for pain management. An ultrasound examination was ordered to confirm the diagnosis of appendicitis and rule out other causes of abdominal pain.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient is scheduled for follow-up in 2 weeks to monitor her recovery and remove any remaining sutures from the surgical site, if applicable. She should return to the clinic for a post-operative checkup and further evaluation as needed. The patient was advised to follow a low-fiber diet during the recovery period to minimize discomfort.
