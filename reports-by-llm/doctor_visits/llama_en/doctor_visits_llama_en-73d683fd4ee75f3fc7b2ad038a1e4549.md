Visit Summary:

Date: 24.09.2024
Location: Taivalkoski Clinic

Patient Information:
Gender: Female
Age: 41

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with complaints of worsening back pain and fatigue over the past few weeks, which has significantly impacted her daily activities.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient reported a gradual increase in lower back pain, radiating to her left buttock, accompanied by morning stiffness. She also experienced generalized fatigue, which worsened throughout the day. The pain is exacerbated by movement and relieved by rest. Additionally, she noticed some weight loss over the past month.

Physical Examination Findings:
Given the severity level of 2 (Emergent â€“ potential life threat), a thorough physical examination was performed to assess for any underlying conditions that may be contributing to her symptoms. The patient's vital signs were stable, with a blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg and a heart rate of 90 beats per minute. A complete neurological examination revealed no focal deficits or weakness in the lower extremities.

The physical examination also noted tenderness in the left lumbar region, which was exacerbated by palpation. The patient's gait was slightly altered due to pain, but no significant instability was observed. The rest of the examination was unremarkable.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of chronic lower back pain with possible lumbar radiculopathy is suspected. Further diagnostic testing, such as imaging studies (e.g., MRI), may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and rule out any underlying conditions that may require urgent attention.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient was prescribed 500mg of ibuprofen three times daily for pain management and 100mg of pregabalin twice daily for nerve pain. She was also advised to maintain a healthy diet, engage in regular exercise, and avoid heavy lifting or bending.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient is scheduled for follow-up appointment in two weeks to reassess her symptoms and adjust the treatment plan as needed. In the meantime, she should continue to take her prescribed medications and report any changes in her symptoms to the clinic.
