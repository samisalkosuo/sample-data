**Visit Summary**

**Patient Information:**
- Name: [Not provided]
- Gender: Female
- Age: 51
- Clinic/Hospital Location: Mynämäki

**Visit Date:** July 11, 2023

**Severity Level:** 4 (Less-urgent – stable, 1 resource)

**Chief Complaint:**
The patient presented with a complaint of persistent and worsening right lower quadrant abdominal pain over the past week. She reported that the pain is intermittent but has been increasing in severity, making it difficult for her to perform daily activities.

**History of Present Illness (HPI):**
The patient described the onset of symptoms as gradual, starting about 5 days ago. Initially, she thought it might be related to constipation or a viral infection, but the pain has persisted and worsened over time. She also reported some nausea and mild vomiting, particularly after meals. The pain is exacerbated by movement and relieved by rest.

**Physical Examination Findings:**
Given the severity level of 4, the physical examination was focused on assessing for any signs of peritonitis or other complications that might require immediate intervention. The patient's vital signs were stable, with a blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg, heart rate of 90 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. Abdominal examination revealed tenderness in the right lower quadrant but no guarding or rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds were normal.

**Assessment / Diagnosis:**
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of acute appendicitis was made. The patient is at risk for developing complications such as abscess formation or perforation if not treated promptly.

**Plan / Treatment:**
The patient will be admitted to the hospital for observation and treatment. She will receive broad-spectrum antibiotics (e.g., cefoxitin) to cover for potential bacterial infection. An ultrasound of the abdomen will be performed to confirm the diagnosis and assess for any complications. The patient will also be given pain management medication as needed.

**Follow-up Instructions:**
The patient is scheduled for follow-up in 24 hours to reassess her condition and remove the IV line if necessary. She should return home with a family member or caregiver to monitor her symptoms and report any changes to the healthcare provider. The patient will also be given instructions on how to manage pain at home.

**Additional Notes:**
The patient's age and overall health status make her a moderate risk for complications from acute appendicitis. Close monitoring of her condition is necessary to ensure timely intervention if complications arise.
