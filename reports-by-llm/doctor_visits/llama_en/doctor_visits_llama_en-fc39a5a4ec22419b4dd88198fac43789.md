Visit Summary:

Patient Information:
------------------

* Name: [Not provided]
* Date of Birth: [Not provided]
* Gender: Male
* Age: 7 years old

Visit Details:
-----------------

* Visit Date: August 2, 2024
* Clinic/Hospital Location: Kärkölä

Chief Complaint:
----------------

The patient's mother reported that her son has been experiencing intermittent episodes of abdominal pain and vomiting over the past few days. The child is otherwise asymptomatic and has no fever.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
---------------------------------

The patient's symptoms began approximately 3 days ago, with episodes of abdominal pain that worsen after meals. The pain is described as a dull ache in the upper abdomen, which can radiate to the back. Vomiting occurs shortly after the onset of pain, and the child has been unable to keep fluids down. Despite these symptoms, the patient remains hydrated due to frequent sips of water.

Physical Examination Findings:
------------------------------

Given the severity level of 1 (immediate life threat), a thorough examination is warranted. The patient appears pale and slightly lethargic, with a temperature of 37.5°C. Abdominal tenderness is present in the upper quadrant, with guarding noted upon palpation. The liver is mildly enlarged, measuring 2 cm below the costal margin.

Assessment/Diagnosis:
----------------------

Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of acute gastroenteritis is suspected. The presence of abdominal pain, vomiting, and tenderness suggests an infectious etiology, such as viral or bacterial gastroenteritis.

Plan/Treatment:
-----------------

* Fluid replacement: Intravenous fluids will be administered to ensure adequate hydration.
* Antibiotics: A broad-spectrum antibiotic (e.g., amoxicillin) will be prescribed to cover potential bacterial causes of gastroenteritis.
* Anti-emetics: Ondansetron will be given orally to manage nausea and vomiting.

Follow-up Instructions:
-------------------------

The patient is scheduled for follow-up in 2 days to reassess symptoms and adjust treatment as needed. The mother is advised to monitor the child's hydration status closely and report any worsening symptoms or signs of dehydration (e.g., excessive thirst, dark urine).

Discharge Instructions:
-----------------------

* The patient should rest and avoid strenuous activities.
* A bland diet (e.g., crackers, toast) will be recommended for the next 24 hours.
* Antibiotics should be completed as directed to minimize the risk of antibiotic resistance.
