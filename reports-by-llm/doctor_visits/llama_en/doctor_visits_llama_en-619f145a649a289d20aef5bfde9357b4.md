**Visit Summary**

**Date:** 19.07.2024
**Location:** Karijoki Clinic

**Patient Information:**
- **Gender:** Male
- **Age:** 20 years old

**Chief Complaint:**
The patient presented with a complaint of mild abdominal pain and nausea, which started approximately 2 hours prior to the visit.

**History of Present Illness (HPI):**
The patient reported that he had been experiencing mild to moderate abdominal discomfort, described as a dull ache in the upper right quadrant. He also mentioned feeling nauseous and having an elevated temperature of 37.5Â°C. The symptoms started after consuming a large meal at a local restaurant. There was no history of fever prior to this episode.

**Physical Examination Findings:**
Given the severity level (5), the physical examination findings were minimal, focusing on assessing for any signs that might indicate a more serious condition. The patient's vital signs were stable, with a blood pressure of 110/70 mmHg, pulse rate of 80 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. Abdominal tenderness was noted in the upper right quadrant but was not severe. No guarding or rebound tenderness was observed.

**Assessment / Diagnosis:**
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of acute gastroenteritis (mild) was made. The elevated temperature and nausea suggested an infectious cause, which is consistent with viral gastroenteritis. Given the mild nature of the symptoms and the absence of any alarming signs, hospitalization was not required.

**Plan / Treatment:**
The patient was prescribed oral rehydration therapy to manage dehydration and alleviate symptoms. A course of loperamide (2 mg orally every 4 hours) was also recommended to reduce diarrhea. The patient was advised to rest, stay hydrated with clear fluids, and avoid solid foods for the next 24 hours.

**Follow-up Instructions:**
The patient is scheduled for a follow-up appointment in 3 days to assess for improvement or any signs of complications. In the meantime, if symptoms worsen or do not improve, he should contact his primary care physician immediately.
