Visit Summary:

Date: January 13, 2024
Location: Närpiö Clinic

Patient Information:
Male patient, age 55

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with complaints of progressive left-sided chest pain radiating to his back, which worsened over the past two days. He reported feeling short of breath and experiencing occasional coughing fits.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient's symptoms began approximately 48 hours ago, after a strenuous bout of exercise during a recent fishing trip. Initially, he attributed his discomfort to muscle strain but soon realized that the pain was more severe than expected. Over time, the pain has become more persistent and has spread to his left arm, making it difficult for him to perform daily activities.

Physical Examination Findings:
Given the patient's age and severity level (3), a thorough physical examination was conducted. Vital signs were within normal limits. The patient's oxygen saturation was 98% on room air. A chest X-ray revealed no acute cardiac or pulmonary issues, but a small pleural effusion was noted.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
The patient's symptoms are consistent with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), specifically unstable angina. The presence of chest pain radiating to the back and left arm, combined with shortness of breath and coughing fits, supports this diagnosis. Further testing, including an electrocardiogram (ECG) and troponin levels, was ordered to confirm the diagnosis.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient was started on aspirin 81mg PO qd, clopidogrel 75mg PO qd, and metoprolol succinate 50mg PO bid. He was also advised to take nitroglycerin as needed for angina symptoms. The patient will undergo an ECG within the next 24 hours and troponin levels will be drawn to assess cardiac damage.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient is scheduled for a follow-up appointment in two weeks to reassess his condition and adjust treatment as necessary. He is advised to attend all scheduled appointments and to contact the clinic immediately if he experiences any worsening of symptoms or chest pain.

Discharge Summary:
The patient was discharged with instructions on managing his angina symptoms, including taking medications as prescribed and attending follow-up appointments.
