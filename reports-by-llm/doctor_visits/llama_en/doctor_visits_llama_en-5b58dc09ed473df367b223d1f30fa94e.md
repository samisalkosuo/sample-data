Rääkkylä Clinic Visit Summary

Visit Date: December 6, 2024

Patient Information:
- Gender: Male
- Age: 56 years old

Severity Level: 2 (Emergent – potential life threat)

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with a 2-day history of progressive dyspnea and orthopnea, which worsened over the past 24 hours. He reported feeling short of breath even at rest and experiencing nocturnal awakenings due to difficulty breathing.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient's symptoms began 48 hours ago, with a gradual increase in severity. Initially, he experienced mild dyspnea that resolved with oxygen therapy at home. However, the symptoms worsened over time, and he now requires supplemental oxygen at all times. The patient also reports fatigue, which is exacerbated by exertion.

Physical Examination Findings:
Upon examination, the patient exhibited signs of congestive heart failure (CHF), including bilateral rales, jugular venous distension, and an S3 gallop. His oxygen saturation was 92% on room air, indicating a need for supplemental oxygen. The patient's vital signs were as follows: blood pressure 140/90 mmHg, pulse 100 bpm, respiratory rate 24 breaths/min, and temperature 37.5°C.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
The patient's presentation is consistent with acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF). The presence of CHF symptoms, jugular venous distension, and an S3 gallop supports this diagnosis. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause of his heart failure.

Plan / Treatment:
- The patient will be admitted to the hospital for close monitoring and management of his heart failure.
- He will receive intravenous furosemide 40 mg IV q 6 hours, as needed, to manage fluid overload.
- Oxygen therapy will continue at all times, with a target saturation of 88% on room air.
- The patient will be started on aspirin 81 mg daily for secondary prevention of cardiovascular events.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient is scheduled for follow-up in the clinic within 7 days to reassess his condition and adjust treatment as needed. He should contact the office immediately if he experiences worsening symptoms, such as increased shortness of breath or chest pain.

- The patient will need assistance with daily activities, including bathing and dressing.
- He should avoid heavy lifting, bending, or strenuous exercise for the next 2 weeks.
