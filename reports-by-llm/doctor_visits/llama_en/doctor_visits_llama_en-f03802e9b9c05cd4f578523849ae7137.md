Date: July 6, 2024
Location: Haapavesi Clinic

Patient Information:
Female patient, age 8 years

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with a 2-day history of worsening abdominal pain and vomiting.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient's symptoms began on the second day of summer vacation. Initially, she experienced mild abdominal discomfort while playing outside. Over the next 24 hours, her pain worsened, becoming more severe and localized to the right lower quadrant. She also reported nausea and vomiting, which have been accompanied by a low-grade fever. The patient has not had any recent travel or exposure to contaminated food or water.

Physical Examination Findings:
Given the severity level of 2, the physical examination was focused on assessing for potential complications while minimizing unnecessary discomfort to the patient. Vital signs were stable, with a blood pressure of 90/60 mmHg, pulse of 100 beats per minute, and respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute. The abdomen was tender to palpation in the right lower quadrant, but no rebound tenderness or guarding was noted. A low-grade fever (38Â°C) was present.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of acute appendicitis is suspected. Further diagnostic testing, such as imaging studies, may be necessary to confirm this diagnosis.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient will undergo immediate imaging studies, including a CT scan with IV contrast, to confirm the diagnosis of acute appendicitis. She will also receive antibiotics to cover for potential bacterial infection. The patient will be admitted to the hospital for observation and possible surgical intervention if necessary. In the meantime, she will be managed with intravenous fluids and pain management as needed.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient is scheduled for follow-up in 24 hours to reassess her condition and determine the need for further treatment. Her parents will receive instructions on how to manage her symptoms at home and when to seek immediate medical attention if they notice any signs of worsening abdominal pain or other concerning symptoms.

Discharge Summary:

The patient was discharged from the Haapavesi Clinic in stable condition, pending follow-up imaging studies and potential surgical intervention. The patient's parents were provided with instructions on how to manage her symptoms at home and when to seek immediate medical attention if necessary.
