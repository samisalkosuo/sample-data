### History of Present Illness (HPI)

The patient's symptoms began approximately two weeks ago, with an initial episode of coughing up pink, frothy sputum.

The patient reports no chest pain or fever.

### Physical Examination Findings

Given the patient's age and severity level, a comprehensive physical examination was conducted to assess for any underlying conditions contributing to her symptoms. Vital signs were within normal limits. The patient's oxygen saturation was 92% on room air, indicating mild hypoxemia. A chest X-ray revealed bilateral infiltrates consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation.

### Assessment / Diagnosis

Based on the patient's history and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of COPD exacerbation is made. The patient's age and comorbidities suggest that her condition may be more severe than initially apparent. Further evaluation for potential infections or other contributing factors was not deemed necessary given the clinical presentation.

### Plan / Treatment

The patient will be started on oral corticosteroids (prednisone 20mg daily) to reduce inflammation and improve lung function. She will also receive oxygen therapy as needed, with a target saturation of 88% on room air. The patient is advised to use her inhaler as prescribed and avoid strenuous activities until further notice.

### Follow-up Instructions

The patient is scheduled for follow-up in two weeks to assess the effectiveness of treatment and monitor for any signs of worsening symptoms or complications. She is also advised to contact the clinic immediately if she experiences any increase in shortness of breath, chest pain, or fever.
