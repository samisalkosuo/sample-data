Patient Information:
Male, 71 years old

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with complaints of worsening shortness of breath and fatigue over the past week, which have progressively worsened.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient reported a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and has been experiencing increasing dyspnea on exertion. He also mentioned feeling increasingly fatigued, particularly in the morning, which has made it difficult for him to perform daily activities. The patient's symptoms worsened over the past week, with an increase in shortness of breath during minimal exertion.

Physical Examination Findings:
Given the severity level of 4, the physical examination was focused on assessing the patient's respiratory status and overall condition. Vital signs were as follows: blood pressure 140/80 mmHg, pulse 100 beats per minute, oxygen saturation 92% on room air, and respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute. The patient exhibited signs of respiratory distress, including bilateral wheezes and decreased lung sounds in the lower lobes. The patient's oxygen saturation levels were not critically low, but he was showing signs of hypoxia.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
Based on the patient's history and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of acute exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD) was made. The patient's symptoms are consistent with AECOPD, which is characterized by worsening shortness of breath, fatigue, and decreased lung function.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient was prescribed oral corticosteroids 40 mg daily for 5-7 days to reduce inflammation in the lungs. He was also started on a bronchodilator inhaler (albuterol) as needed for symptom relief. The patient's oxygen saturation levels were closely monitored, and supplemental oxygen was administered as necessary.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient is scheduled for follow-up in 2 weeks to reassess his condition and adjust treatment as needed. It is essential that the patient adheres to his medication regimen and follows up with his primary care physician if symptoms worsen or do not improve.

Discharge Summary:
The patient was discharged home with instructions on how to use his inhaler, manage his COPD symptoms, and monitor his oxygen saturation levels. The patient's family members were educated on the importance of recognizing signs of worsening COPD and seeking immediate medical attention if symptoms persist or worsen.
