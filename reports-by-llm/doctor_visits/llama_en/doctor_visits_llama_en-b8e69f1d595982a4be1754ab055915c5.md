Location: Keitele Clinic

Patient Information:
Gender: Female
Age: 35 years

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with complaints of worsening back pain, radiating to her left lower extremity, and intermittent episodes of numbness in her right hand. She reported a gradual increase in symptoms over the past two weeks.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient described her back pain as a dull ache that worsens with movement and improves with rest. The pain is located in the lumbar region, centered at L4-L5, and radiates down to her left calf. She also reported numbness in her right hand, which started several days ago. The numbness is more pronounced when she bends or lifts heavy objects. The patient has a history of osteoporosis and takes calcium supplements daily.

Physical Examination Findings:
Vital signs: Blood pressure 120/80 mmHg, pulse 90/min, temperature 37.4Â°C. On physical examination, the patient exhibited tenderness in her left lower back and calf, with positive straight leg raise test (SLR). The neurological examination revealed decreased sensation in her right hand, particularly on the radial side.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of lumbar disc herniation at L4-L5 is suspected. The presence of numbness in her right hand suggests nerve root compression. Given her history of osteoporosis, further evaluation for potential vertebral fractures is warranted.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient will undergo imaging studies (MRI) to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential causes. She will be prescribed pain management medication (ibuprofen 400mg three times daily) and referred to a specialist for further evaluation and possible surgical intervention.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient is scheduled for follow-up in two weeks to re-evaluate her symptoms and adjust treatment as needed. She is advised to continue taking calcium supplements and maintain good posture to alleviate back pain.
