Visit Summary:

Patient Information:
------------------

* Name: Juhani Kallevala
* Date of Birth: 02.12.1965
* Gender: Male
* Age: 59 years

Visit Details:
-----------------

* Visit Date: April 2, 2025
* Clinic/Hospital Location: Kalajoki Clinic

Chief Complaint:
----------------

Mr. Kallevala presented with a chief complaint of persistent and worsening back pain, radiating to his left leg, which he reported started approximately two weeks ago. He described the pain as a dull ache that worsens with movement and improves with rest.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
---------------------------------

The patient reported that the pain began after lifting heavy boxes at work. Initially, it was manageable, but over the past week, the pain has increased in severity, making it difficult for him to perform daily activities. He also experienced numbness and tingling sensations in his left leg, particularly in the calf area. The patient denied any recent trauma or significant falls.

Physical Examination Findings:
------------------------------

Given the severity of the patient's symptoms (Severity Level 5), a thorough physical examination was performed to assess for any potential life-threatening conditions. The patient's vital signs were stable, with a blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg and a pulse rate of 80 beats per minute. The patient's temperature was normal.

A neurological examination revealed decreased sensation in the left calf and ankle, with a positive Tinel's sign (tingling sensation upon tapping over the nerve). The patient also exhibited limited range of motion in his left hip and knee joints.

Assessment/Diagnosis:
----------------------

Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of lumbar radiculopathy was made. This condition is characterized by compression or irritation of the nerve roots in the lower spine, which can cause pain, numbness, and tingling sensations in the affected leg.

Plan/Treatment:
-----------------

The patient will be prescribed:

* A 3-day course of oral ibuprofen (400mg, three times daily) to manage pain and inflammation.
* A referral to a specialist for further evaluation and potential nerve root decompression surgery if necessary.
* Instructions to continue with physical therapy to maintain range of motion and strength in the affected joints.

Follow-up Instructions:
-------------------------

The patient is scheduled for follow-up appointment in two weeks to reassess his symptoms and adjust treatment as needed. In the meantime, he is advised to:

* Continue with pain management medication as directed.
* Avoid heavy lifting or bending activities until further notice.
* Maintain a regular exercise routine to maintain overall health and mobility.

Discharge Summary:
-------------------

Mr. Kallevala was discharged from the clinic in stable condition, with instructions for follow-up care and treatment. The patient's symptoms are expected to improve with conservative management, but further evaluation may be necessary if his condition worsens or does not respond to treatment.
