**Visit Summary**

**Date:** August 6, 2025
**Location:** Pyhäjärvi Clinic
**Severity Level:** 4 (Less-urgent – stable, 1 resource)

**Patient Information:**
Female patient, age 29.

**Chief Complaint:**
The patient presented with a 2-day history of worsening fatigue and mild headaches. She reported feeling generally unwell and experiencing difficulty concentrating at work.

**History of Present Illness (HPI):**
The patient's symptoms began 2 days ago, with an initial onset of mild fatigue that gradually worsened over the past 24 hours. The fatigue is described as a heavy, aching sensation in her limbs, particularly in her legs. She also reports experiencing mild headaches, which are described as dull and throbbing in nature. The patient denies any fever, chills, or other systemic symptoms. Her sleep patterns have been disrupted, and she has experienced difficulty concentrating at work.

**Physical Examination Findings:**
Upon examination, the patient appears tired and lethargic, with a slightly decreased level of consciousness. Her vital signs are within normal limits. The physical examination is otherwise unremarkable, with no notable abnormalities in her cardiovascular, respiratory, or neurological systems.

**Assessment / Diagnosis:**
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of acute fatigue syndrome is suspected. This condition is characterized by a prolonged period of fatigue that is not explained by any underlying medical condition. The patient's mild headaches and disrupted sleep patterns are likely secondary to her fatigue.

**Plan / Treatment:**
The patient will be prescribed a 5-day course of amoxicillin-clavulanate (500mg twice daily) for potential bacterial infection, as well as a 2-week supply of acetaminophen (325mg every 4 hours as needed) for symptom management. The patient is advised to maintain a regular sleep schedule and engage in gentle exercise, such as yoga or brisk walking, to help manage her fatigue.

**Follow-up Instructions:**
The patient will be scheduled for follow-up appointment in 2 weeks to reassess her symptoms and adjust treatment as necessary. In the meantime, she is advised to contact the clinic if her symptoms worsen or if she experiences any concerning signs or symptoms, such as difficulty breathing or severe headache.

**Additional Notes:**

* The patient's laboratory results will be reviewed prior to discharge to confirm the absence of any underlying infection.
* A referral to a primary care physician for long-term management of fatigue syndrome may be necessary in the future.
