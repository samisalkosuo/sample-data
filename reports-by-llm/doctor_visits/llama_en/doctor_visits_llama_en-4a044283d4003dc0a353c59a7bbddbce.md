**Patient Information:**
Female patient, age 42.

**Chief Complaint:**
The patient presented with a 2-day history of progressive left lower quadrant abdominal pain, accompanied by nausea and vomiting. She reported that the pain worsened over the past 24 hours, prompting her to seek medical attention.

**History of Present Illness (HPI):**
The patient described the onset of symptoms as gradual, starting with mild discomfort that gradually intensified to a sharp, stabbing pain. The pain was localized to the left lower quadrant and radiated to the groin area. She reported no fever, chills, or other systemic symptoms. The patient had been experiencing constipation for several weeks prior to the onset of abdominal pain.

Upon examination, the patient exhibited tenderness in the left lower quadrant, with a positive McMurray's sign (pain on palpation of the patellar tendon). Abdominal bowel sounds were decreased. The patient's vital signs were stable, with a blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg and a pulse rate of 90 beats per minute.

**Assessment / Diagnosis:**
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of acute appendicitis was made. The severity level of 4 indicates that while the patient is experiencing significant discomfort, she is stable and does not require immediate surgical intervention.

**Plan / Treatment:**
The patient will be started on antibiotics (ciprofloxacin 500 mg orally twice daily) to cover for potential bacterial infection. She will also receive pain management with ibuprofen 400 mg orally three times daily as needed. The patient is advised to rest, stay hydrated, and follow a low-fiber diet until further notice.

**Follow-up Instructions:**
The patient will be scheduled for follow-up in one week to assess the resolution of symptoms and monitor for signs of complications. She is advised to return to the clinic if her pain worsens or if she experiences any signs of sepsis (e.g., fever, chills, tachycardia).

**Additional Notes:**
The patient will be educated on proper wound care and hygiene practices to prevent potential complications.
