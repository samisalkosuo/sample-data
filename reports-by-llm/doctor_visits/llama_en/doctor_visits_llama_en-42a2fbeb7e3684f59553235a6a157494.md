Date: 21.05.2024
Location: Naantali Clinic

Patient Information:
Male, 104 years old

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with complaints of worsening shortness of breath and fatigue over the past week, which has significantly impacted his daily activities.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient reported a gradual increase in dyspnea (shortness of breath) and fatigue, particularly after minimal exertion. He also mentioned experiencing orthopnea (difficulty breathing while lying down) and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (waking up with shortness of breath). The patient's symptoms worsened over the past few days, leading him to seek medical attention.

Physical Examination Findings:
Given the patient's age and severity level 4, a comprehensive physical examination was performed. Vital signs were stable, with a blood pressure of 140/80 mmHg, pulse of 100 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on room air. The patient exhibited signs of deconditioning, including decreased muscle mass and weakness in the extremities. Lung sounds were clear bilaterally, but there was a noticeable decrease in breath sounds over the left lower lobe. Cardiac examination revealed a grade 2/6 systolic murmur.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
Based on the patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, and age, the primary diagnosis is heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). The patient's orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea are consistent with left-sided heart failure. The presence of a systolic murmur may indicate coronary artery disease or other cardiac comorbidities.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient was started on furosemide 40 mg orally twice daily for symptomatic relief of fluid overload and shortness of breath. Lisinopril 10 mg orally once daily was initiated to reduce blood pressure and alleviate symptoms of heart failure. The patient was also advised to increase his salt intake to 5-6 grams per day to help manage edema.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient is scheduled for a follow-up appointment in two weeks to reassess his condition, monitor vital signs, and adjust medications as necessary. It is essential that the patient adheres to his medication regimen and lifestyle modifications, including increasing salt intake and avoiding strenuous activities.

Discharge Instructions:
The patient was advised to seek immediate medical attention if he experiences worsening shortness of breath, chest pain, or swelling in his legs. He should also report any changes in his medication regimen or symptoms to the healthcare provider promptly.
