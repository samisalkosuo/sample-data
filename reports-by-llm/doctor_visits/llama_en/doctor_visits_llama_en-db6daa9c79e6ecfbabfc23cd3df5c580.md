Visit Summary:

Date: June 3, 2024
Location: Humppila Clinic

Patient Information:
Male Patient, Age 3

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with a 2-day history of fever, cough, and difficulty breathing.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient's parents reported that their child had been playing outside in the garden when he suddenly started to feel unwell. He became increasingly irritable and refused to eat or drink anything for several hours. The next morning, he developed a high fever (39°C) and began coughing up yellowish sputum. His respiratory rate increased significantly, and he became short of breath.

Physical Examination Findings:
Given the patient's age and symptoms, we classified this visit as Urgent (Severity Level 3). The patient was found to be febrile with a temperature of 39°C, tachypneic with a respiratory rate of 40/min, and tachycardic with a heart rate of 120/min. Bilateral wheezes were noted on lung auscultation.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, we diagnosed Acute Respiratory Tract Infection (ARTI) with possible viral etiology. The high fever, cough, and difficulty breathing suggest a lower respiratory tract infection.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient was started on oral acetaminophen 15mg/kg every 4 hours as needed for fever reduction and oral oseltamivir 75mg/kg/day in two divided doses for suspected influenza. Oxygen saturation monitoring will be performed daily, and the patient will be assessed for respiratory distress.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient is scheduled to follow up with our clinic in 3 days for reassessment of symptoms and completion of medication course. Parents are advised to monitor their child's temperature, cough, and breathing rate closely and seek immediate attention if they experience any worsening of symptoms or difficulty breathing.
