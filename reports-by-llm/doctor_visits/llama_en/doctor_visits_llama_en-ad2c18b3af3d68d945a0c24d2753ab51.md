**Visit Summary**

**Date:** 25.12.2024
**Location:** Kouvola Clinic
**Severity Level:** 5 (Non-urgent – minor complaints)

**Patient Information:**
Female patient, age 21.

**Chief Complaint:**
The patient presented with a complaint of mild itching and a small, flat, red rash on her left forearm. She reported that the rash appeared 2 days ago and has been gradually worsening in size.

**History of Present Illness (HPI):**
The patient described the rash as itchy but not painful. She mentioned that she had recently started using a new laundry detergent and had also come into contact with some unknown plant material during her recent outdoor activities. The rash is located on her left forearm, approximately 5 cm in diameter, and has a slightly scaly texture.

**Physical Examination Findings:**
The patient's vital signs were within normal limits. Her temperature was 37.2°C, blood pressure was 120/80 mmHg, pulse was 70/min, and respiratory rate was 12/min. The rash on her left forearm was observed to be mildly erythematous with a few small vesicles. There were no signs of systemic illness or significant abnormalities on physical examination.

**Assessment / Diagnosis:**
Based on the patient's presentation, it is likely that she has developed an allergic contact dermatitis due to exposure to the new laundry detergent and/or the unknown plant material. The rash is consistent with this diagnosis, and there are no other signs of infection or systemic illness.

**Plan / Treatment:**
The patient will be prescribed a topical corticosteroid cream (0.05% hydrocortisone) for application directly to the affected area 2-3 times daily for 7-10 days. She is also advised to avoid further exposure to the suspected allergen and to use gentle soap and water for washing.

**Follow-up Instructions:**
The patient should follow up with our clinic in 1 week to assess the response to treatment and remove any remaining scarring. If the rash does not improve or worsens, she should return to the clinic sooner.

No further action is required at this time, as the patient's condition is mild and self-limiting.
