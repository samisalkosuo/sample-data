Patient Information:
Male, 59 years old

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with complaints of worsening shortness of breath and fatigue over the past few weeks, which have progressively worsened.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient reported a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He described his symptoms as starting with mild exertional dyspnea that gradually increased in severity, leading to orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. The patient also experienced fatigue, which worsened over time. He denied any recent respiratory infections or exposure to environmental toxins.

Physical Examination Findings:
Given the patient's age and medical history, a thorough physical examination was performed. Vital signs revealed a blood pressure of 160/90 mmHg, heart rate of 92 bpm, and oxygen saturation of 92% on room air. The lungs were clear to auscultation, with no evidence of wheezing or crackles. The patient's extremities were cool to touch, indicating possible peripheral vasoconstriction.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) was made. The patient's elevated blood pressure and signs of fluid overload support this diagnosis.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient was started on lisinopril 20mg daily for hypertension and furosemide 40mg daily for fluid overload. He was also prescribed metoprolol succinate 50mg twice daily for heart failure. The patient was advised to increase his sodium intake to 3,500 mg/day and to limit his fluid intake.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient is scheduled for a follow-up appointment in two weeks to reassess his symptoms and adjust his medication regimen as needed. He is also advised to monitor his blood pressure and report any changes to the clinic.

Severity Level: 3 (Urgent)
