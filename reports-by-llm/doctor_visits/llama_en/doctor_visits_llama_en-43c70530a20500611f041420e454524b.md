Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with complaints of worsening shortness of breath and fatigue over the past week. He reported difficulty breathing during exertion, particularly when walking up stairs.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient's symptoms began approximately two weeks ago, initially mild but gradually increasing in severity. He described his breathing as labored and reported feeling weak and tired even after resting. The patient also mentioned experiencing occasional chest discomfort that worsened with exertion. There was no recent travel history or exposure to potential allergens.

Physical Examination Findings:
Upon examination, the patient exhibited signs of cardiovascular compromise. His oxygen saturation levels were 92% on room air, indicating mild hypoxemia. Blood pressure readings were 140/90 mmHg, and his pulse rate was 100 beats per minute. The physical exam revealed no acute distress or pain.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
Given the patient's age, symptoms of worsening shortness of breath, fatigue, and chest discomfort, a diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation is suspected. Further evaluation may include laboratory tests to assess lung function and potential comorbid conditions such as heart failure or anemia.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient was prescribed a 30-day course of oral corticosteroids for COPD exacerbation, along with a short-acting beta-agonist inhaler (SABA) for symptom relief. The patient is also advised to use a humidifier in his home environment and avoid exposure to pollutants.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient is scheduled for follow-up appointment in two weeks to assess the effectiveness of treatment and monitor lung function. In the meantime, he should continue to take prescribed medications as directed and report any worsening symptoms immediately.

Additional Recommendations:
- The patient's family members are advised to seek immediate medical attention if they notice any signs of respiratory distress or failure.
- A referral for pulmonary rehabilitation is recommended to improve overall health and manage chronic conditions effectively.
