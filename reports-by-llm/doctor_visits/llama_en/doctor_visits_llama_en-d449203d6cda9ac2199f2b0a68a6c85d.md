Location: Huittinen Clinic

Patient Information:
Male, 52 years old

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with complaints of worsening shortness of breath and fatigue over the past week, which have progressively worsened despite increasing physical activity.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient reported a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He described his symptoms as starting with mild exertional dyspnea, which gradually increased in severity over the past 7 days. The patient also experienced orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. He denied any chest pain or cough.

Physical Examination Findings:
Given the patient's age and medical history, a thorough physical examination was performed to assess for signs of cardiovascular disease. Vital signs revealed a blood pressure of 160/90 mmHg and an oxygen saturation of 92% on room air. The patient exhibited signs of right ventricular hypertrophy, including jugular venous distension and a loud S3 heart sound. The lungs were clear to auscultation.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) was made. The patient's elevated blood pressure and signs of right ventricular hypertrophy suggest possible pulmonary hypertension.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient was started on intravenous furosemide 40 mg IV q6h and nitroglycerin 3 mg sublingual q5min as needed for dyspnea. He was also prescribed metoprolol succinate 50 mg orally twice daily to reduce blood pressure and alleviate symptoms of heart failure. The patient's oxygen saturation will be monitored closely, and he will be evaluated for possible pulmonary embolism.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient is scheduled for follow-up in 2 weeks to assess for improvement in symptoms and adjust medication as needed. He is advised to maintain a low-sodium diet, increase fluid intake, and avoid heavy lifting or strenuous exercise until further notice.
