**Visit Summary**

**Date:** 31.07.2025
**Location:** Mäntsälä Clinic

**Patient Information:**
- **Gender:** Female
- **Age:** 72 years old

**Chief Complaint:**
The patient presented with a complaint of progressive difficulty breathing, which worsened over the past few days.

**History of Present Illness (HPI):**
The patient reported experiencing increasing shortness of breath, particularly during exertion and at night. She also mentioned feeling fatigued and having a general feeling of malaise. The symptoms started approximately 2 weeks ago and have progressively worsened. There was no recent travel or exposure to potential allergens.

**Physical Examination Findings:**
Given the severity level of 4, the physical examination findings were focused on assessing respiratory function and overall stability. Vital signs revealed a blood pressure of 160/90 mmHg, pulse rate of 100 beats per minute, oxygen saturation of 92% on room air, and respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute. The patient's lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally. The cardiac examination was unremarkable.

**Assessment / Diagnosis:**
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation with possible pneumonia is suspected. Further diagnostic testing, including a chest X-ray and possibly a CT scan of the lungs, may be necessary to confirm the presence of pneumonia.

**Plan / Treatment:**
The patient was prescribed a 5-day course of oral antibiotics for suspected pneumonia, in addition to her existing COPD medication regimen. She will also receive oxygen therapy as needed to manage her shortness of breath. The patient is advised to rest and avoid strenuous activities until further notice. A follow-up appointment has been scheduled for 1 week from the date of this visit.

**Follow-up Instructions:**
The patient should return to the clinic in 1 week for a follow-up appointment to assess the effectiveness of treatment and make any necessary adjustments to her medication regimen. In the meantime, she is advised to contact the clinic if her symptoms worsen or if she experiences any concerning signs such as increased shortness of breath, chest pain, or fever.

**Additional Notes:**
The patient's age and comorbidities (hypertension and hyperlipidemia) were taken into consideration during the assessment. The patient was also advised to maintain good hygiene practices and avoid close contact with others to prevent potential transmission of respiratory pathogens.
