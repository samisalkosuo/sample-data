Patient Information:
Female patient, age 24

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with complaints of worsening fatigue and shortness of breath over the past week, which has significantly impacted her daily activities.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient reported feeling increasingly fatigued, particularly after physical exertion, and experienced shortness of breath during periods of rest. She also mentioned experiencing mild chest discomfort that worsened with deep breathing. The symptoms began approximately 1 week ago and have progressively worsened. The patient denied any recent travel or exposure to potential infectious agents.

Physical Examination Findings:
Given the severity level of 3, the physical examination was focused on assessing for signs of cardiovascular instability. Vital signs revealed a blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg, pulse of 100 bpm, and oxygen saturation of 92% on room air. The patient's lungs were clear to auscultation, and there were no notable abnormalities in cardiac examination. However, the patient exhibited signs of fatigue, including decreased muscle mass and weakness.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) was made. The patient is suspected to have stable angina, given the absence of chest pain at rest and the presence of exertional symptoms.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient was prescribed aspirin 81 mg daily for antiplatelet effects, lisinopril 10 mg daily for blood pressure management, and metoprolol succinate 50 mg twice daily for beta-blockade. The patient was also advised to maintain a healthy lifestyle, including regular exercise, a balanced diet, and stress reduction techniques.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient is scheduled for follow-up in 2 weeks to reassess her symptoms and adjust medication as needed. It is essential that the patient adheres to the prescribed treatment plan and attends all scheduled appointments to ensure optimal management of her condition.

Severe cases may require hospitalization, further testing, or more aggressive interventions.
