Visit Summary:

Date: 13.05.2024
Location: Siilinj√§rvi Clinic

Patient Information:
- Gender: Female
- Age: 85 years

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with complaints of progressive shortness of breath, orthopnea, and fatigue over the past week.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient reported a gradual worsening of symptoms, starting with mild exertional dyspnea that worsened over time. She described feeling winded even when performing light activities such as walking or doing household chores. The patient also mentioned orthopnea, where she feels short of breath while lying down and experiences relief when sitting up. Additionally, she reported fatigue, which has been persistent and affecting her daily activities.

Physical Examination Findings:
Given the severity level of 5 (non-urgent), the physical examination was focused on assessing the patient's overall condition rather than looking for acute distress signs. The patient appeared anxious but calm during the examination. Her vital signs were within normal limits, with a blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg and an oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. The lungs were clear to auscultation, and there was no evidence of congestion or edema.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
The patient's presentation is consistent with chronic heart failure, specifically left-sided heart failure given the orthopnea. The patient's age and comorbidities (hypertension, hyperlipidemia) also support this diagnosis. Further diagnostic testing, such as an echocardiogram or troponin levels, may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient was started on 25 mg of spironolactone daily for symptomatic heart failure and advised to increase her fluid intake to reduce symptoms. The patient is also encouraged to maintain a regular exercise routine, such as walking, to improve cardiovascular fitness. A follow-up appointment will be scheduled in two weeks to reassess the patient's condition.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient should return to the clinic in two weeks for a follow-up appointment. In the meantime, she should monitor her symptoms and report any changes or concerns to the healthcare provider. The patient is also advised to maintain good hydration and avoid overexertion.

Discharge Summary:
The patient was discharged home with instructions on managing her heart failure symptoms and scheduling follow-up appointments as needed.
