**Date:** March 10, 2024
**Location:** Laukaa Clinic
**Severity Level:** 4 (Less-urgent – stable, 1 resource)

**Patient Information:**
Female patient, age 4 years.

**Chief Complaint:**
The patient's mother reported a 2-day history of fever, vomiting, and abdominal pain in her child. The mother also mentioned that the child has been having difficulty keeping fluids down.

**History of Present Illness (HPI):**
The patient was brought to the clinic by her mother due to concerns about her child's symptoms. Upon examination, the patient appeared lethargic and had a temperature of 38.5°C. The abdomen was tender to palpation, particularly in the right lower quadrant. The patient had been vomiting for the past 2 days, with some episodes of diarrhea. She had not been able to keep fluids down, which led to dehydration.

**Physical Examination Findings:**
Given the severity level of 4, the physical examination findings were focused on assessing the patient's overall condition and identifying any potential complications. The patient was found to be mildly dehydrated, with a decreased urine output. The abdomen was tender to palpation, but no signs of peritonitis or severe abdominal pain were noted. The lungs were clear, and there were no signs of respiratory distress.

**Assessment / Diagnosis:**
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of viral gastroenteritis (VGE) was made. The patient's dehydration and vomiting suggested that she required fluid replacement to prevent further complications.

**Plan / Treatment:**
The patient was prescribed oral rehydration solution (ORS) to manage her dehydration. She was also given acetaminophen for pain management and anti-diarrheal medication to reduce the frequency of diarrhea. The mother was advised to monitor the patient's temperature, vomiting, and stool output closely and seek immediate attention if the patient showed signs of worsening symptoms or failure to improve.

**Follow-up Instructions:**
The patient is scheduled for a follow-up appointment in 2 days to assess her progress and adjust treatment as needed. The mother was instructed to continue administering ORS and monitoring the patient's condition closely. If the patient's symptoms worsened or failed to improve, she should contact the clinic immediately.
