**Visit Summary**

**Date:** 13.02.2025
**Location:** Kolari Clinic
**Severity Level:** 4

**Patient Information:**
- **Gender:** Male
- **Age:** 69 years

**Chief Complaint:**
The patient presented with complaints of progressive difficulty breathing, particularly during exertion, and a persistent cough productive of yellow sputum. He reported feeling fatigued and experiencing mild chest discomfort.

**History of Present Illness (HPI):**
The patient's symptoms began approximately two weeks ago, worsening over time. Initially, he experienced occasional shortness of breath while walking, but it has since progressed to more frequent episodes during daily activities. The cough is productive of yellow sputum, and the patient reports feeling increasingly fatigued. He also mentions experiencing mild chest discomfort that worsens with deep breathing.

**Physical Examination Findings:**
Given the severity level of 4, the physical examination was focused on assessing respiratory function and identifying potential causes for the patient's symptoms. The patient exhibited signs of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including a decreased lung expansion and increased breath sounds bilaterally. His oxygen saturation levels were 92% on room air, indicating mild hypoxemia.

**Assessment / Diagnosis:**
The patient's presentation is consistent with exacerbation of COPD, likely secondary to smoking history. The presence of yellow sputum production suggests a possible bacterial infection. Further diagnostic testing, including a chest X-ray and possibly a CT scan, may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and assess for any potential complications.

**Plan / Treatment:**
The patient was prescribed a short-course inhalation therapy with bronchodilators (albuterol) and a corticosteroid inhaler. Antibiotics were also prescribed to cover for a possible bacterial infection. The patient is advised to use his inhalers as directed, take antibiotics for the full duration of the prescription, and follow up in one week.

**Follow-up Instructions:**
The patient should return to the clinic in one week for a follow-up appointment to assess the effectiveness of treatment and monitor for any signs of complications. In the meantime, he is advised to avoid strenuous activities and maintain good respiratory hygiene practices.

**Additional Recommendations:**

- The patient's smoking history and current symptoms warrant further discussion regarding smoking cessation strategies.
- A referral to a pulmonologist may be necessary for long-term management of COPD.
