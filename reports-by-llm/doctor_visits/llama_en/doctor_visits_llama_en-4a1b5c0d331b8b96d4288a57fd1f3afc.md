Visit Summary:

Date: October 11, 2024
Location: Närpiö Clinic

Patient Information:
Female patient, age 65

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with complaints of worsening shortness of breath and fatigue over the past few weeks.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient reported a gradual increase in symptoms, starting with mild exertional dyspnea that worsened over time. She also experienced fatigue, particularly in the morning, which interfered with her daily activities. The patient denied any recent respiratory infections or exposure to potential allergens. Her symptoms have progressively worsened, leading to decreased mobility and difficulty performing daily tasks.

Physical Examination Findings:
Given the severity level of 4, the physical examination was focused on assessing the patient's overall condition rather than conducting a comprehensive evaluation. Vital signs were stable, with a blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg, pulse of 80 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on room air. The patient appeared pale and slightly short of breath, but no acute distress was noted.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
Based on the patient's history and physical examination findings, the diagnosis is suspected chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation. The patient's symptoms are consistent with a worsening of her underlying respiratory condition, likely due to increased airway resistance and decreased lung function.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient was prescribed a short-course inhaler therapy with bronchodilators and corticosteroids to manage her COPD symptoms. She will also be started on oxygen therapy at home, with the goal of maintaining an oxygen saturation level above 90% on room air. The patient is advised to maintain good lung hygiene, avoid smoking, and participate in pulmonary rehabilitation.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient is scheduled for a follow-up appointment in two weeks to reassess her symptoms and adjust treatment as needed. She will also be referred to a pulmonologist for further evaluation and management of her COPD. The patient is instructed to contact the clinic if she experiences any worsening of her symptoms or concerns about her oxygen therapy.

Discharge Instructions:
The patient was provided with written instructions on how to use her inhaler, oxygen concentrator, and other prescribed medications. She was also advised to monitor her oxygen saturation levels at home and report any changes to her healthcare provider.
