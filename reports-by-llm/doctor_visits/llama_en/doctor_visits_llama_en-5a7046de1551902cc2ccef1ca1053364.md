Patient Information:
Male, 44 years old

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with complaints of worsening back pain and fatigue over the past few weeks, which has significantly impacted his daily activities.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient reported a gradual increase in back pain, starting from mild discomfort to severe ache, particularly in the lower back region. He also experienced fatigue, which worsened over time, leading to difficulty maintaining employment and social activities. The patient denied any recent trauma or significant weight loss. He mentioned that his back pain is exacerbated by physical activity and relieved by rest.

Physical Examination Findings:
Given the severity level of 4, the patient's presentation warrants a thorough examination. Vital signs were within normal limits. On physical examination, the patient exhibited tenderness in the lower back region, with significant muscle spasm and limited range of motion. The patient also displayed signs of fatigue, including pale skin and decreased appetite.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of chronic low back pain was made. Further evaluation revealed no evidence of acute injury or infection. The patient's fatigue is likely related to his back pain, as well as potential underlying metabolic or endocrine disorders.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient will be prescribed 500mg of ibuprofen three times daily for pain management and 100mg of pregabalin twice daily for muscle spasm relief. A referral to a specialist for further evaluation and potential surgery is recommended if symptoms persist or worsen. The patient is advised to maintain a healthy diet, engage in regular exercise, and avoid heavy lifting.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient will be scheduled for follow-up appointment in two weeks to reassess his condition. In the meantime, he is instructed to monitor his pain levels and report any changes to the healthcare provider. It is essential to adhere to the prescribed medication regimen and attend all scheduled appointments to ensure optimal management of his condition.
