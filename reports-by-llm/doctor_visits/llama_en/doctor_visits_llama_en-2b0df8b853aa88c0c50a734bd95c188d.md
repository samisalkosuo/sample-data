Visit Summary:

Date: March 29, 2024
Location: Myrskyl√§ Clinic

Patient Information:
Male patient, age 21

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with complaints of worsening back pain and fatigue over the past week, which has significantly impacted his daily activities.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient reported a gradual increase in lower back pain, starting from mild discomfort to moderate severity. He described the pain as a dull ache, worsened by movement and relieved by rest. Additionally, he experienced persistent fatigue, which made it difficult for him to perform physical tasks or maintain his usual level of activity. The patient also mentioned occasional episodes of dizziness, which resolved on its own within minutes.

Physical Examination Findings:
Given the severity level of 4, the examination was conducted with caution and attention to detail. Vital signs were stable, with a blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg, pulse of 70 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. The patient's back pain was assessed using the modified Ottawa Knee Rule, which revealed tenderness in the lumbar region. A thorough neurological examination did not reveal any focal deficits or signs of nerve root compression.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of acute lumbago (lower back strain) with possible musculoskeletal stress was made. Further evaluation revealed no evidence of infection, fracture, or other serious conditions that would necessitate immediate attention.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient was prescribed 500 mg of ibuprofen three times daily for pain management and inflammation reduction. A physical therapy referral was also offered to address the underlying muscle imbalances contributing to his condition. The patient was advised to maintain a regular exercise routine, focusing on core strengthening and flexibility exercises to prevent future episodes.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient is scheduled for follow-up in two weeks to reassess his symptoms and adjust treatment as needed. In the meantime, he should continue to take ibuprofen as directed and report any worsening symptoms or concerns to the clinic.
