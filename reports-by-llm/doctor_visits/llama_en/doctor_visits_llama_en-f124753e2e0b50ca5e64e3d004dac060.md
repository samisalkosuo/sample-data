Female patient, age 50

Chief Complaint:

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient reported a gradual increase in lower back pain, radiating to her left buttock, accompanied by morning stiffness. She also experienced fatigue, particularly after physical activity, and had difficulty sleeping due to discomfort. The pain worsened over the past week, making it difficult for her to perform daily tasks.

Physical Examination Findings:
Given the severity level of 3 (Urgent), the patient's physical examination revealed tenderness in the left lumbar region, with moderate stiffness upon movement. Her vital signs were within normal limits. A thorough neurological examination did not reveal any focal deficits or sensory changes.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of chronic lower back pain was made. The patient's age and gender also contributed to the likelihood of osteoarthritis as a contributing factor.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient was prescribed ibuprofen 400mg twice daily for pain management and advised to maintain a regular exercise routine, including low-impact aerobics and stretching exercises. A referral to an orthopedic specialist was made for further evaluation and potential intervention.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient is scheduled for follow-up in two weeks to reassess her symptoms and adjust the treatment plan as needed. She is also advised to maintain a weight management plan, if applicable, and to report any changes in her symptoms or pain levels promptly.
