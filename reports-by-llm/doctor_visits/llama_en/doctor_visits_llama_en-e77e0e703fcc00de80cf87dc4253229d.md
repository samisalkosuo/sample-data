Location: Merij√§rvi Clinic

Patient Information:
Gender: Female
Age: 87 years

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with complaints of worsening shortness of breath and fatigue over the past few days.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient reported experiencing increasing difficulty breathing, particularly during exertion, and feeling fatigued. She also mentioned a recent history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation, for which she has been taking oral corticosteroids. The symptoms worsened over the past 24 hours, with the patient reporting an inability to perform daily activities without becoming winded.

Physical Examination Findings:
Given the severity level of 1, the patient's presentation was deemed life-threatening. The patient was found unresponsive in her bed, requiring immediate resuscitation efforts. Upon regaining consciousness, she was tachypneic (rapid breathing) and tachycardic (rapid heart rate). Her oxygen saturation was low, indicating severe hypoxemia.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
The patient's presentation is consistent with acute exacerbation of COPD, likely precipitated by a recent respiratory infection. The low oxygen saturation and inability to maintain adequate ventilation necessitate immediate attention.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient was started on supplemental oxygen via non-rebreather mask, with an initial flow rate of 6 liters per minute. She was also administered intravenous fluids and oxygen therapy as needed. The oral corticosteroids were continued, but the dose was increased to 40 mg prednisone every 6 hours.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient is to be admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for close monitoring and ongoing respiratory support. She will require regular assessments of her oxygen saturation, blood pressure, and respiratory status. The patient's family has been notified, and they are advised to contact the clinic immediately if there are any changes in her condition.

Discharge Instructions:
The patient is to be discharged home once she is stable enough for discharge, which is expected to occur within 24-48 hours. She will require follow-up appointments with the pulmonologist to adjust her treatment plan and monitor her progress.

Note: The patient's family has been informed of the severity of her condition and the need for close monitoring in the ICU. They have also been advised on how to manage her symptoms at home, including the use of oxygen therapy and medication as prescribed.
