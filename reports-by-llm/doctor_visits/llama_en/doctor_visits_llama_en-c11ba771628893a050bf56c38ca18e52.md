Patient Information:
Female patient, age 17

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with complaints of worsening abdominal pain and nausea over the past 24 hours.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient reported a gradual increase in abdominal pain, starting as a mild discomfort that worsened over time. She also experienced nausea and vomiting, which have been present for approximately 12 hours. The pain is described as a dull ache, located in the upper right quadrant of her abdomen. There is no associated fever or chills. The patient has not experienced any changes in bowel movements or urination patterns.

Physical Examination Findings:
Given the severity level of 4, the physical examination was focused on assessing for signs of dehydration and abdominal tenderness. The patient appeared slightly dehydrated, with decreased urine output over the past 24 hours. Her vital signs were stable, with a blood pressure of 110/70 mmHg and a pulse rate of 80 beats per minute. Abdominal examination revealed tenderness in the upper right quadrant, but no guarding or rebound tenderness was noted.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of acute appendicitis is suspected. The patient's age and presentation are consistent with this diagnosis. Further testing, such as imaging studies (e.g., ultrasound), may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient will be admitted for observation and treatment. She will receive intravenous fluids to address dehydration and potential electrolyte imbalances. Antibiotics will be administered to cover for possible bacterial infection. The patient will also undergo imaging studies to confirm the diagnosis of appendicitis. If necessary, surgical consultation will be obtained for potential appendectomy.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient is scheduled for follow-up in 24 hours to assess for improvement or worsening symptoms. She should return to the clinic if she experiences any increase in abdominal pain, fever, or vomiting. The patient's family has been instructed on how to manage her symptoms at home and when to seek immediate medical attention.

Discharge Instructions:
The patient will be discharged with instructions to rest, stay hydrated, and avoid heavy lifting or strenuous activities. She should follow a low-fiber diet for the next 24 hours to minimize discomfort.

Note: The severity level of 4 indicates that the patient's condition is stable but requires close observation and potential surgical intervention.
