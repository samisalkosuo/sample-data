Location: Kitee Clinic

Patient Information:
Gender: Male
Age: 12 years old

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with a 2-day history of worsening abdominal pain, accompanied by nausea and vomiting.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient reported that his abdominal pain began as mild discomfort after eating a large meal on the previous day. Over the past 24 hours, the pain has increased in severity, becoming more diffuse and radiating to the back. He also experienced nausea and vomiting, which have worsened throughout the day. The patient denied any fever or blood in stool.

Physical Examination Findings:
Given the patient's age and symptoms, a high level of suspicion for appendicitis was present. A rapid abdominal examination revealed tenderness in the right lower quadrant, with guarding (muscle tension) and rebound tenderness (pain upon palpation). The patient's vital signs were stable, but his oxygen saturation was slightly decreased.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
Based on the physical examination findings and clinical presentation, a diagnosis of acute appendicitis was made. This condition is considered an urgent medical emergency due to the risk of perforation and peritonitis.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient was administered IV fluids and broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover for potential bacterial infection. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen was ordered to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other causes of abdominal pain. The patient will be admitted to the hospital for further management, including surgical consultation and possible appendectomy.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient is scheduled for follow-up in 24 hours to assess for improvement or worsening symptoms. His parents are advised to monitor his condition closely and seek immediate medical attention if he experiences any signs of sepsis (e.g., fever, chills, difficulty breathing).

Severity Level: 3

Note: The severity level was chosen based on the patient's clinical presentation and the need for urgent surgical consultation and hospital admission.
