Date: June 30, 2025
Location: Pälkäne Clinic

Patient Information:
- Gender: Female
- Age: 72 years

Severity Level: 3 (Urgent)

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with complaints of worsening shortness of breath and fatigue over the past week. She reported difficulty breathing during exertion, particularly when walking up stairs.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient's symptoms began approximately two weeks ago, following a recent hospitalization for pneumonia. Since then, her condition has progressively worsened, with increasing shortness of breath at rest and during minimal activity. The patient also reports feeling weak and tired, which has significantly impacted her daily activities.

Physical Examination Findings:
Given the severity level of 3, the physical examination was focused on assessing the patient's respiratory status and overall well-being. Vital signs revealed a blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg, pulse of 100 beats per minute, oxygen saturation of 92% on room air, and respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute. The lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally. The patient's extremities showed signs of edema, particularly in the lower legs.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
Based on the patient's history and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of congestive heart failure (CHF) with exacerbation is suspected. The patient's age, comorbid conditions, and recent hospitalization for pneumonia contribute to her unstable condition.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient was started on intravenous furosemide 40 mg IV q 6 hours and nitroglycerin 3 mg sublingual as needed for angina symptoms. She is also prescribed metoprolol succinate 50 mg orally twice daily for heart rate control. The patient will be closely monitored for signs of worsening heart failure, including increased shortness of breath, edema, or decreased urine output.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient is scheduled to follow up with the cardiologist in two weeks for further evaluation and management. In the meantime, she should continue to take her medications as prescribed and report any changes in symptoms to the healthcare provider promptly. The patient's family members are advised to monitor her condition closely and seek immediate medical attention if they notice any signs of worsening heart failure.

Discharge Instructions:
The patient is advised to avoid heavy lifting, bending, or strenuous activities for the next two weeks. She should also elevate her legs above the level of the heart when lying down to reduce swelling.
