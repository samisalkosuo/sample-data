**Date:** August 8, 2024
**Location:** Sonkaj√§rvi Clinic
**Severity Level:** 3 (Urgent)

**Patient Information:**
Female patient, age 35.

**Chief Complaint:**
The patient presented with a 2-day history of worsening left lower quadrant abdominal pain, accompanied by nausea and vomiting. She reported that the pain has been increasing in severity over the past 24 hours, making it difficult for her to move around and perform daily activities.

**History of Present Illness (HPI):**
The patient's symptoms began on August 5, 2024, after a meal at a local restaurant. Initially, she experienced mild discomfort, but it gradually worsened over the next few days. She has not noticed any significant changes in her bowel movements or urination patterns. The pain is described as sharp and stabbing, radiating to her back and right lower quadrant.

**Physical Examination Findings:**
Upon examination, the patient exhibited tenderness in the left lower quadrant, with a positive Rovsing's sign (tenderness in the right lower quadrant when pressing on the left lower quadrant). The abdominal muscles were tense, and there was no guarding or rebound tenderness. The patient's vital signs were stable, with a blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg, heart rate of 90 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air.

**Assessment / Diagnosis:**
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of acute appendicitis is suspected. The severity level of 3 indicates that while the patient is not in immediate danger, she requires prompt attention to prevent complications such as perforation or abscess formation.

**Plan / Treatment:**
The patient will be admitted for observation and treatment. She will receive IV fluids and antibiotics to manage her symptoms and prevent infection. A diagnostic imaging study (e.g., CT scan) will be ordered to confirm the diagnosis and assess for any potential complications. The patient will also undergo a surgical consultation to discuss possible appendectomy.

**Follow-up Instructions:**
The patient is scheduled for follow-up in 24 hours to reassess her condition and remove any sutures or staples from the surgical site, if applicable. She should return to the clinic for further evaluation and potential discharge instructions.

**Discharge Information:**
The patient will be discharged with a prescription for antibiotics (e.g., ciprofloxacin) and pain management medication (e.g., acetaminophen). She is advised to rest, stay hydrated, and follow a low-fiber diet until the surgical consultation.
