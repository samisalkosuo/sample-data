Female patient, age 44

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with complaints of worsening back pain and fatigue over the past few weeks, which has significantly impacted her daily activities.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient reported a gradual increase in lower back pain, radiating to her left buttock, accompanied by morning stiffness. She also experienced fatigue, particularly after physical activity, and reported difficulty sleeping due to discomfort. The pain worsened over the past week, prompting her to seek medical attention.

Physical Examination Findings:
Given the severity level of 4, the patient's presentation was assessed as stable but requiring additional resources for management. Vital signs were within normal limits. On examination, tenderness was noted in the left lumbar region, and range of motion was limited due to pain. Muscle mass and strength were preserved.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
The patient's symptoms are consistent with chronic lower back pain, likely related to degenerative changes or musculoskeletal strain. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause.

Plan / Treatment:
A comprehensive physical therapy program will be initiated to address muscle strengthening, flexibility, and posture correction. The patient will also receive guidance on proper lifting techniques and ergonomic adjustments for work-related activities. In addition, a prescription for acetaminophen 500mg three times daily as needed for pain management will be provided.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient is scheduled for follow-up in two weeks to reassess progress and adjust the treatment plan as necessary. She is advised to maintain a consistent exercise routine, including stretching and strengthening exercises, and to report any changes in symptoms or pain levels promptly.

Medications:
Acetaminophen 500mg three times daily as needed for pain management.

Procedures:
None scheduled at this time.
