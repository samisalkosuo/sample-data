**Date:** 18 December 2024
**Location:** Karstula Clinic
**Severity Level:** 3 (Urgent)

**Patient Information:**
- Gender: Female
- Age: 65 years

**Chief Complaint:**
The patient presented with complaints of progressive shortness of breath, orthopnea, and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea over the past two weeks. She reported feeling fatigued and experiencing mild chest discomfort during exertion.

**History of Present Illness (HPI):**
The patient's symptoms began approximately two weeks ago, with an initial episode of coughing up pink, frothy sputum. Since then, her shortness of breath has worsened, particularly at rest and during exertion. She also experiences orthopnea, where she feels the need to sit upright to alleviate chest discomfort. Nocturnal dyspnea is present, with episodes occurring several times a week. The patient's fatigue level has increased significantly over this period.

**Physical Examination Findings:**
Upon examination, the patient exhibited signs of congestive heart failure (CHF), including bilateral jugular venous distension and an S3 gallop. Her lung exam revealed bilateral rales and crackles consistent with pulmonary edema. The patient's oxygen saturation was 92% on room air, indicating mild hypoxemia.

**Assessment / Diagnosis:**
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of congestive heart failure (CHF) is made. The severity level of 3 indicates that while the patient is stable, she requires additional resources to manage her condition effectively.

**Plan / Treatment:**
The patient will be started on furosemide 40 mg orally twice daily for edema management and metoprolol succinate 50 mg orally once daily for symptomatic heart failure. She will also receive oxygen therapy as needed and be advised to increase fluid intake while limiting sodium intake.

**Follow-up Instructions:**
The patient is scheduled for a follow-up appointment in two weeks to assess the effectiveness of her current treatment regimen. In the meantime, she should monitor her symptoms closely, report any worsening of shortness of breath or chest discomfort immediately, and adhere strictly to her medication regimen.
