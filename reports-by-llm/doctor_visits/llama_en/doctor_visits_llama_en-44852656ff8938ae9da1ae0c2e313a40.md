**Patient Information:**
- Gender: Female
- Age: 79 years old

**Chief Complaint:**
The patient presented with complaints of worsening shortness of breath and fatigue over the past week.

**History of Present Illness (HPI):**
The patient reported a gradual increase in difficulty breathing, particularly during exertion. She also mentioned feeling increasingly fatigued, which has affected her ability to perform daily activities. The symptoms started approximately 2 weeks ago and have progressively worsened. There is no history of chest pain or cough.

**Physical Examination Findings:**
Given the patient's age and severity level (1), a thorough assessment was conducted with immediate attention to vital signs and respiratory function. Vital signs were as follows:
- Blood Pressure: 160/90 mmHg
- Pulse: 110 beats per minute
- Respiratory Rate: 24 breaths per minute
- Oxygen Saturation: 92% on room air

The patient's oxygen saturation was low, indicating a potential respiratory issue. The physical examination revealed no acute distress or signs of cardiac failure.

**Assessment / Diagnosis:**
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of Acute Pulmonary Embolism (PE) with hypoxia is suspected. This condition requires immediate attention due to the risk of sudden deterioration.

**Plan / Treatment:**
The patient was immediately admitted for further evaluation and treatment. She received oxygen therapy via nasal cannula and was started on anticoagulation therapy with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) as prescribed by the emergency department. The patient will be closely monitored for signs of improvement or deterioration.

**Follow-up Instructions:**
The patient is scheduled to follow up with the primary care physician in 2 days to assess her condition and adjust treatment as necessary. In the meantime, she should continue to receive oxygen therapy and adhere to the prescribed anticoagulation regimen. The patient's family members were educated on recognizing signs of worsening symptoms, such as increased shortness of breath or chest pain.

**Additional Notes:**
The patient was referred to the hospital's pulmonary medicine department for further evaluation and management.
