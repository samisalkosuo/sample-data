Location: Juuka Clinic

Patient Information:
- Gender: Male
- Age: 55 years

Severity Level: 2 (Emergent – potential life threat)

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with a 2-day history of progressive dyspnea, orthopnea, and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. He reported feeling short of breath at rest and experiencing worsening symptoms over the past 24 hours.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient's symptoms began 48 hours ago, with an initial episode of coughing up pink, frothy sputum. Since then, his respiratory status has deteriorated, with increasing shortness of breath and orthopnea. He also reports experiencing nocturnal awakenings due to difficulty breathing. The patient denies any recent travel or exposure to sick individuals.

Physical Examination Findings:
Vital signs: Temperature 37.5°C, Blood Pressure 140/90 mmHg, Respiratory Rate 24/min, Oxygen Saturation 92% on room air.
The patient appears anxious and short of breath, with bilateral wheezes and crackles heard in the lungs bilaterally. The lungs are clear to auscultation except for scattered wheezes.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is made. The presence of orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea suggests fluid overload, which may be contributing to his respiratory distress.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient will be started on oxygen therapy via nasal cannula with a flow rate of 4-6 liters per minute. He will also receive bronchodilator inhalation (albuterol) as needed for symptom relief. The patient's fluid status will be monitored closely, and diuretics may be added if necessary to manage fluid overload.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient is advised to follow up with the physician in 2 weeks for reevaluation of his respiratory status. He should continue to use his inhaler as prescribed and report any worsening symptoms immediately. The patient's family members are also instructed on how to administer oxygen therapy and recognize signs of worsening respiratory distress.

Discharge Instructions:
The patient is advised to rest at home, avoid strenuous activities, and stay hydrated by drinking plenty of fluids. He should also avoid exposure to smoke and other irritants that may exacerbate his condition.
