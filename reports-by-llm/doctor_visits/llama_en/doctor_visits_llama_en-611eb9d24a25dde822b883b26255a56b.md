Patient Information:
Male, 75 years old

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with complaints of worsening shortness of breath and fatigue over the past few weeks.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient reported a gradual increase in symptoms, starting with mild exertional dyspnea that worsened over time. He also experienced fatigue, particularly in the morning, which made it difficult for him to perform daily activities. The patient denied any recent respiratory infections or exposure to environmental toxins. His medical history is notable for hypertension and hyperlipidemia.

Physical Examination Findings:
Given the patient's age and severity level (1), a high index of suspicion for cardiac causes was warranted. The patient appeared pale and slightly short of breath, with a narrow pulse oximetry reading of 92% on room air. His blood pressure was 160/90 mmHg, and his heart rate was 110 beats per minute. The lungs were clear to auscultation, but the patient's jugular venous distension (JVD) was notable. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
Based on the patient's presentation, a diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) with signs of cardiac failure was made. The patient's ECG showed ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, and aVF, consistent with an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Further testing, including troponin levels and echocardiography, confirmed the diagnosis.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient was immediately admitted to the coronary care unit for close monitoring and aggressive management of his ACS. He received intravenous beta blockers, nitrates, and a statin, as well as oxygen therapy to improve oxygen saturation. The patient also underwent an emergency percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to restore blood flow to the affected coronary artery.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient will be followed up with in 24 hours for further evaluation of his cardiac function and removal of the catheter. He is advised to take his medications as prescribed, attend follow-up appointments, and avoid strenuous activities until cleared by his healthcare provider.

* The patient was discharged home on day 2 post-admission.
