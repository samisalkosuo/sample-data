**Patient Information:**
Female patient, age 17

**Chief Complaint:**
The patient presented with a complaint of worsening acne on her face and back, which she described as painful and inflamed. She reported that the symptoms have been persistent for several weeks and have worsened over time.

**History of Present Illness (HPI):**
The patient's acne began to manifest approximately 6 months ago, initially presenting with mild redness and small papules on her face. Over time, the lesions have grown in size and number, becoming increasingly painful and inflamed. She reports that she has tried over-the-counter treatments without relief. The patient also experiences occasional breakouts of cystic acne, which can be quite painful.

**Physical Examination Findings:**
Upon examination, the patient's skin is characterized by numerous inflammatory lesions, including papules, pustules, and nodules, primarily on her face and back. The lesions are tender to the touch and exhibit signs of active inflammation. There is no evidence of systemic symptoms or organ dysfunction.

**Assessment / Diagnosis:**
Based on the patient's presentation and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of moderate acne (acne vulgaris) is made. Given the severity of her symptoms and the presence of painful lesions, topical treatments are recommended to manage inflammation and prevent scarring.

**Plan / Treatment:**
The patient will be prescribed:

* Topical retinoid gel 0.05% for use at bedtime
* Oral doxycycline 50mg once daily for 3 months
* Antibiotic cream for localized treatment of infected lesions

Follow-up appointments are scheduled for 2 weeks and 6 weeks to assess response to treatment.

**Follow-up Instructions:**
The patient is advised to:

* Apply topical retinoid gel as directed
* Take oral doxycycline with food and water
* Use antibiotic cream only on affected areas
* Maintain good hygiene practices, including regular washing of the face and avoiding picking or popping acne lesions

It is essential that the patient adheres to this treatment plan to achieve optimal results.
