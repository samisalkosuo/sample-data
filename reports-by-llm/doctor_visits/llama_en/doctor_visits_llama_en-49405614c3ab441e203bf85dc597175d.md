Patient Information:
Female patient, aged 68 years

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with complaints of worsening shortness of breath and fatigue over the past week, which has significantly impacted her daily activities.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient reported a gradual increase in dyspnea (shortness of breath) and fatigue, particularly after minimal exertion. She also experienced orthopnea (difficulty breathing while lying down), paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (waking up with shortness of breath), and mild cough. The patient's symptoms worsened over the past few days, leading her to seek medical attention.

Physical Examination Findings:
Given the severity level of 2, the physical examination was focused on assessing respiratory function and potential signs of cardiac involvement. Vital signs were within normal limits. Pulmonary examination revealed bilateral wheezes and mild crackles in both lungs. The patient's oxygen saturation was 92% on room air. Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed nonspecific T-wave inversions.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
The patient's presentation is suggestive of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation, with possible underlying cardiac involvement. Further testing, including a chest X-ray and echocardiogram, was recommended to confirm the diagnosis and assess for potential cardiac complications.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient was prescribed oral corticosteroids (prednisone 20mg daily) for 7-10 days to manage inflammation and symptoms. She was also advised to use a nebulizer with bronchodilator as needed, according to her symptoms. The patient's family member was instructed on how to administer the medication and monitor her condition.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient is scheduled for follow-up in two weeks to reassess her symptoms and adjust treatment as necessary. It is essential that she attends all scheduled appointments and adheres to the prescribed treatment plan to prevent further exacerbations of COPD.

Note: The patient's family member was also advised to seek immediate medical attention if the patient experiences any worsening of symptoms, such as increased shortness of breath or chest pain.
