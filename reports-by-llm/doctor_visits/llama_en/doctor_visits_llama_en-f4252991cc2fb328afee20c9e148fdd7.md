Visit Summary:

Date: February 6, 2024
Location: Heinola Clinic

Patient Information:
Female patient, age 25

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with complaints of worsening acne and persistent redness on her face, particularly on the T-zone area.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient reported that her acne symptoms have been gradually increasing in severity over the past few months. She described the lesions as painful, tender to the touch, and accompanied by increased oil production. The patient also mentioned experiencing occasional post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH) on her cheeks. She denied any recent trauma or significant changes in her skin care routine.

Physical Examination Findings:
Given the severity of the patient's symptoms (Severity Level 5), a thorough examination was conducted to assess the extent of the acne and potential complications. The patient's face showed multiple inflammatory lesions, including papules, pustules, and nodules, primarily on the T-zone area. The skin was also found to be oily, with increased sebum production noted in the affected areas. No signs of infection or scarring were observed.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
Based on the patient's presentation and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of moderate acne (acne vulgaris) was made. The patient's symptoms are consistent with this diagnosis, and further evaluation is not necessary at this time.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient was prescribed a topical retinoid gel (0.05%) to be applied twice daily for the next 6 weeks to help control inflammation and prevent scarring. Additionally, a low-dose oral antibiotic (doxycycline 50mg) was started once daily for 3 months to target bacterial causes of acne. The patient was also advised on proper skin care techniques, including gentle cleansing, moisturizing, and avoiding picking or popping lesions.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient is scheduled for a follow-up appointment in 6 weeks to assess the effectiveness of treatment and adjust as necessary. In the meantime, she should continue to apply the topical retinoid gel and take her oral antibiotic as directed. It is also essential to maintain good skin care habits and avoid triggers that may exacerbate acne symptoms.
