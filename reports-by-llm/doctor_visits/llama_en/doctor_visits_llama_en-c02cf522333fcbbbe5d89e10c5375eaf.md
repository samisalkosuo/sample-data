Patient Information:
Male, 73 years old

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with complaints of progressive difficulty breathing and fatigue over the past two weeks.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient reported a gradual worsening of shortness of breath, particularly in the morning, which has made it increasingly difficult for him to perform daily activities. He also experiences fatigue, which is affecting his ability to carry out tasks such as gardening and walking. The patient's breathing difficulties are not accompanied by any chest pain or cough.

Physical Examination Findings:
Given the severity level of 3 (Urgent), the physical examination revealed signs consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation, including bilateral wheezing, decreased lung sounds, and a slightly elevated respiratory rate. The patient's oxygen saturation was 92% on room air.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with an acute exacerbation of COPD. Further diagnostic testing, such as a chest X-ray or pulmonary function tests, may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and assess the severity of the condition.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient will be started on high-flow nasal cannula therapy to help improve oxygen saturation and reduce respiratory distress. He will also receive a prescription for salmeterol inhaler (50 mcg twice daily) and fluticasone inhaler (250 mcg once daily). The patient is advised to use his inhalers as directed and to avoid smoking.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient should follow up with the clinic in two weeks to assess the effectiveness of treatment and adjust the plan as necessary. It is also essential for him to attend a pulmonary rehabilitation program to improve his overall lung function and reduce symptoms.

- Salmeterol inhaler (50 mcg twice daily)
- Fluticasone inhaler (250 mcg once daily)

Procedures:

Monitoring:
The patient will be monitored for signs of respiratory distress, such as increased shortness of breath or decreased oxygen saturation.

Note: The plan and treatment may vary based on the doctor's discretion and further evaluation.
