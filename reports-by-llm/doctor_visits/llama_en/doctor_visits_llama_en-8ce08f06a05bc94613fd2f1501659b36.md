Patient Information:
Male patient, age 67 years

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with complaints of progressive difficulty breathing and a persistent cough, which worsened over the past week.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient reported that he has been experiencing increasing shortness of breath, particularly during physical activity. He also mentioned a persistent cough that produces yellowish sputum. The symptoms started approximately 7 days ago and have progressively worsened. The patient denied any recent travel or exposure to potential infectious agents.

Physical Examination Findings:
Given the severity level of 5, the patient's presentation is consistent with an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient was found to be in moderate distress, with a respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute and an oxygen saturation of 92% on room air. Bilateral lung crackles were noted, and the patient exhibited signs of respiratory fatigue.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
Based on the clinical presentation and physical examination findings, the patient is diagnosed with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) complicated by ARDS. The diagnosis is supported by the patient's history of smoking, which is a known risk factor for COPD, as well as the presence of bilateral lung crackles.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient was started on oxygen therapy via nasal cannula with a flow rate of 4 liters per minute and supplemental oxygen as needed to maintain an oxygen saturation of at least 90%. The patient was also prescribed oral corticosteroids (prednisone) 40 mg daily for 7-10 days, in addition to his regular COPD medication. The patient's inhaler was adjusted to a higher dose of bronchodilator.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient is scheduled for follow-up in 2 weeks to reassess his oxygen saturation and lung function. It is essential that the patient adheres to his treatment plan and attends all scheduled appointments to monitor his condition and adjust his medication as needed.

Note: The severity level of 5 indicates a life-threatening situation, and the patient requires close monitoring and aggressive treatment to prevent further deterioration.
