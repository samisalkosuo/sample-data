Patient Information:
Male patient, age 60

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with complaints of progressive difficulty breathing and chest tightness over the past two weeks.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient reported a gradual increase in shortness of breath, particularly during physical exertion. He also experienced occasional episodes of chest pain that worsened with deep breathing. The symptoms have been persistent, and he has tried to manage them with over-the-counter medications without relief. The patient's oxygen saturation levels have been consistently below 90% on room air.

Physical Examination Findings:
Given the severity level of 4, the physical examination was focused on assessing the patient's respiratory status and potential cardiac involvement. Vital signs revealed a temperature of 37.5°C, blood pressure of 140/80 mmHg, pulse of 110 bpm, and oxygen saturation of 85% on room air. The patient exhibited signs of respiratory distress, including increased work of breathing and bilateral wheezes. Cardiac examination was unremarkable.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation. The presence of persistent shortness of breath, chest tightness, and decreased oxygen saturation levels supports this diagnosis. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause of the exacerbation.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient was started on oral corticosteroids 40 mg daily for 5 days, in addition to his existing inhaler therapy. He was also prescribed a bronchodilator inhaler as needed. The patient's oxygen saturation levels were maintained above 90% with supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient is scheduled for follow-up appointment in two weeks to reassess his condition and adjust treatment as necessary. It is essential that the patient adheres to his medication regimen and follows up promptly if symptoms worsen or do not improve.

Note: The severity level of 4 indicates a moderate to severe condition requiring close monitoring and potential hospitalization if symptoms worsen.
