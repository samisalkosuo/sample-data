**Visit Summary**

**Date:** June 12, 2024
**Location:** Siikajoki Clinic
**Severity Level:** 5 (Non-urgent â€“ minor complaints)

**Patient Information:**
Female patient, age 89 years.

**Chief Complaint:**
The patient presented with a complaint of mild left-sided shoulder pain and stiffness, which she reported had been worsening over the past week. She also mentioned experiencing occasional numbness in her right arm, particularly at night.

**History of Present Illness (HPI):**
The patient's symptoms began approximately 7-10 days ago, with the shoulder pain gradually increasing in intensity. The pain is described as a dull ache, worsened by movement and relieved by rest. She also reported experiencing occasional tingling sensations in her right arm, which are more pronounced at night. These symptoms have not been accompanied by any fever, chills, or other systemic signs of illness.

**Physical Examination Findings:**
Given the patient's age and severity level, a thorough physical examination was conducted to rule out any underlying conditions that may be contributing to her symptoms. The left shoulder was tender to palpation, with limited range of motion. The right arm showed no significant abnormalities. Neurological examination revealed mild paresthesia in the right arm, particularly on the ulnar side.

**Assessment / Diagnosis:**
Based on the patient's presentation and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of osteoarthritis (OA) of the left shoulder joint is suspected. The numbness in her right arm is likely related to compression or irritation of the radial nerve, possibly due to the patient's age-related muscle atrophy.

**Plan / Treatment:**
The patient will be prescribed ibuprofen 400mg twice daily for pain management and inflammation reduction. A referral to a rheumatologist will be made to further evaluate and manage her OA symptoms. The patient is advised to maintain good posture, avoid heavy lifting, and engage in gentle exercises to maintain range of motion.

**Follow-up Instructions:**
The patient will be scheduled for follow-up appointment in 6 weeks to reassess her symptoms and adjust treatment as needed. In the meantime, she is instructed to contact the clinic if her symptoms worsen or if she experiences any significant changes in her condition.

**Additional Notes:** The patient's age and comorbidities (e.g., hypertension, hyperlipidemia) will be taken into consideration during future appointments to ensure optimal management of her OA symptoms.
