Patient Information:
Male, 75 years old

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with complaints of worsening shortness of breath and fatigue over the past week, which has significantly impacted his daily activities.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient reported a gradual increase in dyspnea, particularly during exertion, and an accompanying decrease in exercise tolerance. He also mentioned feeling weak and lacking energy, which has led to difficulties with daily tasks such as bathing and dressing. The patient's symptoms worsened over the past few days, prompting him to seek medical attention.

Physical Examination Findings:
Given the patient's age and severity level of 3 (urgent), a thorough physical examination was performed. Vital signs revealed a blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg, pulse of 100 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on room air. The patient exhibited signs of respiratory distress, including bilateral wheezes and an increased respiratory rate. A chest radiograph (not performed during this visit) would be necessary to further evaluate the patient's lung status.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation was made. The patient's age and comorbidities also contributed to the severity of his condition.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient was prescribed a short-course inhaler therapy with bronchodilators and corticosteroids to manage his COPD symptoms. He was also advised to use oxygen therapy as needed, with a target saturation level of 88% on room air. The patient's physician will schedule follow-up appointments in one week and two weeks to monitor his progress.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient is instructed to return to the clinic for follow-up appointments at 1 week and 2 weeks from today's date. He should also contact the clinic immediately if he experiences any worsening of symptoms, such as increased shortness of breath or chest pain. Additionally, the patient will be provided with a list of emergency contact numbers and oxygen therapy instructions.

Discharge Summary:
The patient was discharged in stable condition, but with clear instructions to manage his COPD exacerbation and monitor for signs of worsening symptoms.
