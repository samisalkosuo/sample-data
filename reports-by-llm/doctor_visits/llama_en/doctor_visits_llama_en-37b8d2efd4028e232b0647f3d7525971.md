**Visit Summary**

**Date:** 13.03.2025
**Location:** Vöyri Clinic
**Severity Level:** 4 (Less-urgent – stable, 1 resource)

**Patient Information:**
Male patient, age 90 years.

**Chief Complaint:**
The patient presented with complaints of progressive shortness of breath and fatigue over the past week, which have worsened over the past two days. He reported feeling increasingly weak and having difficulty performing daily activities due to his respiratory symptoms.

**History of Present Illness (HPI):**
The patient's shortness of breath is described as a dull, non-productive cough with occasional wheezing. He reports that his breathing becomes more labored when walking or climbing stairs. The patient also experiences fatigue, which worsens throughout the day and is relieved by rest. There are no reported chest pain, fever, or sputum production.

**Physical Examination Findings:**
Given the patient's age and severity level, a thorough physical examination was performed to assess for any underlying conditions contributing to his symptoms. The patient's vital signs were stable, with a blood pressure of 140/80 mmHg, pulse of 100 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on room air. The lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally, with no wheezing or crackles noted. The patient's extremities were cool to touch, indicating possible decreased perfusion.

**Assessment / Diagnosis:**
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation is suspected. The patient's age and comorbid conditions, such as hypertension and hyperlipidemia, may contribute to his respiratory symptoms.

**Plan / Treatment:**
The patient will be prescribed a short-course inhaler therapy with bronchodilators and corticosteroids to manage his COPD exacerbation. He will also receive oxygen therapy as needed to maintain adequate oxygen saturation levels. The patient's blood pressure and lipid profiles will need to be monitored closely, and any necessary adjustments made to his medication regimen.

**Follow-up Instructions:**
The patient is scheduled for follow-up in one week to assess the effectiveness of his treatment plan and adjust medications as needed. He should return to the clinic if he experiences worsening symptoms, such as increased shortness of breath or chest pain. The patient's family members are advised to monitor his oxygen saturation levels at home and seek immediate medical attention if they notice any signs of respiratory distress.

**Additional Notes:**
The patient's social worker will be notified to assist with arranging transportation to follow-up appointments and providing support with daily activities.
