Ranua Clinic
Visit Summary
Date: November 3, 2024

Patient Information:
- Gender: Female
- Age: 97 years

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with complaints of worsening shortness of breath and fatigue over the past week.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient reported a gradual increase in difficulty breathing, particularly during exertion. She also mentioned feeling increasingly fatigued, even when resting. These symptoms have worsened over the past week, leading to her current visit. The patient has no significant history of respiratory issues and has been relatively healthy until recently.

Physical Examination Findings:
Given the severity level of 5 (non-urgent), the physical examination was focused on assessing the patient's overall condition rather than specific organ systems. Vital signs were within normal limits, with a blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg, pulse of 80 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. The patient appeared frail but comfortable, with no acute distress.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
The patient's symptoms are consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation, given her age and history. Further evaluation would typically involve a chest X-ray or CT scan to assess for any complications such as pneumonia. However, considering the severity level of 5, further diagnostic testing may not be immediately necessary.

Plan / Treatment:
- The patient was prescribed a short course of oral corticosteroids (prednisone) to help manage her COPD exacerbation.
- A follow-up appointment with a pulmonologist is recommended for further evaluation and management.
- The patient was advised on proper use of inhalers and encouraged to maintain good lung hygiene.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient should return for a follow-up appointment in two weeks to assess the effectiveness of treatment. In the meantime, she should continue to use her inhalers as prescribed and avoid strenuous activities until further notice.
