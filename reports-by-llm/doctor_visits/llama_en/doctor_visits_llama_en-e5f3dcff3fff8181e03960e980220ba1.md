**Patient Information:**
Female patient, age 63

**Chief Complaint:**
The patient presented with a 2-day history of progressive dyspnea and orthopnea, which worsened over the past 24 hours. She reported feeling short of breath even at rest and experiencing nocturnal awakenings due to difficulty breathing.

**History of Present Illness (HPI):**
The patient's symptoms began 48 hours ago, with a gradual increase in severity. Initially, she experienced mild dyspnea that resolved with oxygen therapy at home. However, over the past 24 hours, her symptoms have worsened, and she is now experiencing more pronounced shortness of breath, particularly on exertion. She also reports orthopnea, where she feels the need to sit up or lean forward when lying down due to chest discomfort.

**Physical Examination Findings:**
Upon examination, the patient appears anxious and distressed. Her oxygen saturation is 92% on room air, with a respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute. Bilateral lung sounds are clear, but there is a mild wheeze heard in both lungs. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg and a heart rate of 100 beats per minute.

**Assessment / Diagnosis:**
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is suspected. The patient's history of smoking and previous respiratory issues support this diagnosis.

**Plan / Treatment:**
The patient will be started on oxygen therapy via nasal cannula with a flow rate of 4 liters per minute. She will also receive a prescription for albuterol inhaler, which she will use as needed. In addition, the patient will be prescribed prednisone 40 mg daily for 5 days to reduce inflammation in the airways.

**Follow-up Instructions:**
The patient is scheduled for follow-up appointment in 2 weeks to reassess her symptoms and adjust treatment as necessary. She is advised to continue using her inhaler as directed and to report any worsening symptoms or concerns to her healthcare provider.

**Additional Recommendations:**

* The patient will be educated on proper use of oxygen therapy and inhalers.
* A referral to a pulmonologist for further management and potential bronchodilator therapy will be made.
* The patient's primary care physician will review her medication list to ensure that all necessary medications are being taken as prescribed.
