Visit Summary:

Date: February 29, 2024
Location: Kannonkoski Clinic

Patient Information:
Gender: Male
Age: 52

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with complaints of progressive difficulty breathing over the past few days, which has worsened over the past 24 hours. He reported feeling short of breath even when sitting still and experiencing a dry cough.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient's symptoms began approximately 3-4 days ago, initially presenting as mild dyspnea that improved with rest. However, over the past 24 hours, his symptoms have escalated, and he is now experiencing significant shortness of breath at rest. He reports no fever or chest pain but does mention a dry, non-productive cough.

Physical Examination Findings:
Vital signs: BP 120/80 mmHg, HR 100 bpm, SpO2 92% on room air.
The patient appears anxious and uncomfortable, with significant respiratory distress. Lung exam reveals bilateral wheezes and decreased breath sounds in the lower lung fields. The patient's oxygen saturation is low, indicating potential hypoxemia.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of acute bronchitis is suspected. Given the severity of his respiratory distress and low oxygen saturation, this condition warrants close monitoring and possible hospital admission for further evaluation and management.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient will be started on antibiotics (amoxicillin-clavulanate 500mg twice daily) to address the suspected bacterial etiology of his bronchitis. He will also receive oxygen therapy via nasal cannula to improve oxygen saturation levels. The patient is advised to rest, stay hydrated, and avoid strenuous activities.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient will be scheduled for a follow-up appointment in 2-3 days to reassess his symptoms and adjust treatment as necessary. In the meantime, he should continue to take antibiotics as directed and monitor his oxygen saturation levels closely. If his condition worsens or he experiences increased shortness of breath, chest pain, or fever, he should contact the clinic immediately.

Severity Level: 2 (Emergent â€“ potential life threat)

Note: The patient's low oxygen saturation levels and significant respiratory distress warrant close monitoring and possible hospital admission for further evaluation and management.
