Location: Padasjoki Clinic

Patient Information:
Female patient, aged 83 years

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with complaints of worsening shortness of breath and fatigue over the past week, which has significantly impacted her daily activities.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient reported a gradual increase in dyspnea (shortness of breath) and fatigue, particularly after minimal exertion. She also experienced orthopnea (difficulty breathing while lying down), paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (waking up with shortness of breath), and mild coughing. The patient's symptoms worsened over the past few days, leading to decreased mobility and increased reliance on oxygen therapy at home.

Physical Examination Findings:
Given the severity level of 4, the physical examination was focused on assessing the patient's respiratory status and overall condition. Vital signs revealed a heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure of 160/90 mmHg, and an oxygen saturation of 92% on room air. The patient exhibited signs of respiratory distress, including increased work of breathing and bilateral wheezes. The lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation was made. The patient's age, comorbidities, and history of smoking further supported this diagnosis. Additional testing, including a chest X-ray and arterial blood gas analysis, may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and assess the severity of the exacerbation.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient will be admitted to the hospital for close monitoring and management of her COPD exacerbation. She will receive oxygen therapy, bronchodilators, and corticosteroids as prescribed by her primary care physician. The patient's primary care physician will also prescribe antibiotics if a secondary bacterial infection is suspected.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient will be scheduled for follow-up with her primary care physician in 2 weeks to reassess her condition and adjust treatment as needed. In the meantime, she should continue to use her prescribed medications as directed and report any changes in symptoms or worsening of respiratory function.

Discharge Summary:
The patient was discharged from the hospital on August 30, 2024, with a plan for continued management of her COPD exacerbation at home. The patient's family members were educated on proper oxygen therapy usage, medication administration, and signs of worsening respiratory function.
