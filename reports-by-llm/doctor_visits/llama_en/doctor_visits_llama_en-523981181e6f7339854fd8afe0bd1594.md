Visit Summary:

Date: April 4, 2024
Location: Taivassalo Clinic

Patient Information:
Male patient, age 91 years

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with complaints of worsening shortness of breath and fatigue over the past week.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient reported a gradual increase in difficulty breathing, particularly during exertion. He also experienced increased fatigue, which has worsened over the past few days. The patient's oxygen saturation levels have been consistently below 90% on room air. There is no recent history of trauma or significant illness.

Physical Examination Findings:
Given the patient's age and severity level (2), a thorough physical examination was performed to assess for any underlying causes of his symptoms. Vital signs were as follows: blood pressure 160/90 mmHg, heart rate 110 bpm, respiratory rate 24 breaths/min, oxygen saturation 88% on room air. The patient's lungs were clear to auscultation, and there was no evidence of edema or congestion. The patient's extremities were cool to touch, indicating poor perfusion.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
The patient's presentation is consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation, likely secondary to a viral infection. Given the patient's age and severity level, close monitoring in the hospital setting is necessary to prevent further decline.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient was started on oxygen therapy via nasal cannula at 4 liters/minute, with plans for titration as needed. The patient will receive intravenous fluids and antibiotics for suspected pneumonia. A chest X-ray will be ordered to assess for any pulmonary complications. The patient's medications will be reviewed and adjusted as necessary.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient will be seen in the clinic in 2 days for further evaluation and management of his COPD exacerbation. The patient is advised to continue oxygen therapy at home, with regular monitoring of oxygen saturation levels. Follow-up appointments will also be scheduled with the primary care physician to review medication regimens and adjust as necessary.

Discharge Instructions:
The patient was discharged home with instructions to rest and avoid exertion. The patient's family members were educated on the importance of monitoring oxygen saturation levels at home and seeking immediate medical attention if symptoms worsen or do not improve with treatment.
