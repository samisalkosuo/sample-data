Visit Summary:

Date: November 17, 2024
Location: Evijärvi Clinic

Patient Information:
Male, 74 years old

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with complaints of progressive shortness of breath and fatigue over the past few weeks.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient reported that his symptoms began approximately 6 weeks ago, worsening gradually over time. He described feeling winded even when performing light activities such as walking or gardening. The patient also mentioned experiencing occasional chest discomfort, which he attributes to angina. However, the discomfort is not always present and seems to be triggered by exertion.

Physical Examination Findings:
Given the patient's age and symptoms, a thorough physical examination was conducted. Vital signs were within normal limits. The patient's oxygen saturation was 98% on room air. Lung sounds were clear bilaterally. Cardiac examination revealed a grade 2/6 systolic murmur best heard at the left sternal border. The patient's extremities were cool to touch, and capillary refill was delayed.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of stable angina pectoris is made. The patient's age and comorbid conditions (hypertension, hyperlipidemia) contribute to his risk profile for cardiovascular events.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient will be started on aspirin 81mg daily and lisinopril 10mg once daily. He will also receive a prescription for atorvastatin 20mg daily to manage his cholesterol levels. The patient is advised to maintain a healthy diet, exercise regularly, and avoid smoking.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient should follow up with the clinic in 3 months for a routine check-up and to assess the effectiveness of his medication regimen. In addition, he will be scheduled for an echocardiogram within the next 6 weeks to further evaluate his cardiac function.

Severity Level: 4 (Less-urgent – stable, 1 resource)

Note: The severity level was chosen based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, which indicate a stable condition that requires minimal resources. However, the patient's age and comorbid conditions warrant close monitoring and follow-up to prevent potential complications.
