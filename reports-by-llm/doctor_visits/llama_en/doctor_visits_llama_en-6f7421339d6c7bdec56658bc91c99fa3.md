Visit Summary:

Patient Name: Juhani K.
Date of Visit: 03.05.2024
Location: Kotka Clinic

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with complaints of worsening back pain, radiating to his left leg, and intermittent numbness in the same area.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
Mr. K. reported a gradual increase in his lower back pain over the past few weeks, which worsened significantly 2 days ago. He described the pain as a dull ache that radiates down his left leg, making it difficult for him to walk or perform daily activities. Additionally, he experienced intermittent numbness and tingling sensations in the same area, which are exacerbated by movement. The patient reported no recent trauma or significant injury.

Physical Examination Findings:
Given the severity level of 3 (Urgent), a thorough physical examination was performed. The patient's vital signs were stable, with a blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg and a pulse rate of 80 beats per minute. On palpation, tenderness was noted in the left lumbar region, and muscle spasms were observed in the affected area. Straight leg raise test (SLR) revealed positive results, indicating possible nerve root compression.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of acute lumbosacral radiculopathy was made. The condition is likely caused by herniated disc material compressing the L5 nerve root, leading to pain, numbness, and tingling in the affected area.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient will be prescribed:

* 500mg of ibuprofen orally twice daily for pain management
* Physical therapy to improve mobility and strength in the affected area
* A referral to an orthopedic specialist for further evaluation and potential surgical intervention

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient is advised to follow up with the referring physician within 2 weeks to reassess his condition. In the meantime, he should continue to take prescribed medications as directed and attend physical therapy sessions twice a week.

Discharge Summary:

Mr. K. was discharged in stable condition, with instructions to manage his pain and symptoms at home. The patient's condition is being closely monitored, and further evaluation will be conducted if necessary.
