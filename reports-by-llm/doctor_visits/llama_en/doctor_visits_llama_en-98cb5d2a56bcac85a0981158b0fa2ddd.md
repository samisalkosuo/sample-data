**Date:** July 9, 2024
**Location:** Kuortane Clinic
**Severity Level:** 4

**Patient Information:**
- **Gender:** Male
- **Age:** 82 years old

**Chief Complaint:**
The patient presented with complaints of progressive difficulty breathing and fatigue over the past week.

**History of Present Illness (HPI):**
The patient reported a gradual worsening of shortness of breath, which started as mild exertional dyspnea but has progressed to become more pronounced at rest. He also experiences fatigue, particularly in the morning, which limits his ability to perform daily activities. The patient denies any chest pain or coughing up blood. His symptoms worsened over the past few days, prompting him to seek medical attention.

**Physical Examination Findings:**
Given the severity level of 4, a thorough physical examination was conducted with emphasis on respiratory and cardiovascular systems. The patient's oxygen saturation levels were found to be significantly decreased (84% on room air), indicating hypoxemia. His pulse rate is elevated at 110 beats per minute, suggesting tachycardia. The lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, but the patient exhibits signs of respiratory distress, including increased work of breathing and use of accessory muscles. Cardiovascular examination reveals a narrow pulse pressure (20 mmHg) and an irregular rhythm on ECG.

**Assessment / Diagnosis:**
Based on the clinical presentation and physical examination findings, the patient is diagnosed with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), complicated by possible pneumonia. The low oxygen saturation levels and signs of respiratory distress necessitate immediate attention to stabilize his condition.

**Plan / Treatment:**
The patient was started on supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula at 4 liters per minute, titrated as needed to maintain an oxygen saturation level above 90%. He is also prescribed oral antibiotics for suspected pneumonia (amoxicillin-clavulanate 500 mg twice daily) and a bronchodilator inhaler (albuterol 2 puffs every 4 hours as needed). The patient will be closely monitored for signs of respiratory failure or worsening condition.

**Follow-up Instructions:**
The patient is scheduled to follow up with the physician in two days to assess his response to treatment, adjust medication as necessary, and plan further management. In the meantime, he should continue to use supplemental oxygen as prescribed and report any changes in symptoms or shortness of breath to the clinic immediately.

**Additional Notes:** The patient's age and comorbid conditions necessitate careful monitoring for potential complications such as respiratory failure or cardiac arrhythmias.
