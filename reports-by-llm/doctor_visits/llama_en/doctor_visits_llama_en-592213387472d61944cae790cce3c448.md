**Visit Summary**

**Date:** August 26, 2023
**Location:** Akaa Clinic
**Severity Level:** 2 (Emergent â€“ potential life threat)

**Patient Information:**
- **Gender:** Female
- **Age:** 17 years old

**Chief Complaint:**
The patient presented with a 2-day history of worsening abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. She reported that her symptoms began after consuming a large meal at a family gathering.

**History of Present Illness (HPI):**
The patient's abdominal pain is described as a dull ache located in the upper right quadrant, radiating to the back. The pain worsens with movement and improves slightly with deep breathing. Nausea and vomiting have been present for 2 days, with the most recent episode occurring approximately 30 minutes prior to presentation. She reports no fever, diarrhea, or blood in her stool. The patient's appetite has decreased significantly over the past day.

**Physical Examination Findings:**
Upon examination, the patient appears anxious but stable. Vital signs are within normal limits (blood pressure 110/70 mmHg, heart rate 80 bpm, respiratory rate 12 breaths/min). Abdominal tenderness is noted in the upper right quadrant, with guarding present upon palpation. The abdomen is soft and non-tender to percussion.

**Assessment / Diagnosis:**
Given the patient's symptoms of worsening abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, a diagnosis of acute appendicitis is suspected. This condition requires prompt evaluation and treatment due to its potential for complications if left untreated.

**Plan / Treatment:**
The patient will undergo immediate imaging studies (CT scan or ultrasound) to confirm the diagnosis. If appendicitis is confirmed, she will be scheduled for surgical consultation to discuss options for appendectomy. In the meantime, she will receive intravenous fluids and pain management as needed. Antibiotics will be administered to cover potential bacterial infection.

**Follow-up Instructions:**
The patient is advised to return to the clinic within 24 hours for further evaluation and possible surgery. She should also follow up with her primary care physician in 1 week post-surgery for a check-up. In the meantime, she should avoid heavy lifting, bending, or strenuous activities.

**Additional Notes:** The patient's age and sex make her a high-risk candidate for complications from appendicitis. Close monitoring of her condition is essential to prevent potential life-threatening complications.
