Location: Lohja Clinic

Patient Information:
Female, 77 years old

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with complaints of worsening shortness of breath and fatigue over the past week.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient reported a gradual increase in difficulty breathing, particularly during exertion. She also experienced generalized fatigue, which has worsened over the past few days. The patient denied any chest pain or coughing up blood. Her symptoms have been exacerbated by mild exertion and relieved by rest.

Physical Examination Findings:
Given the patient's age and severity level of 5 (non-urgent), a thorough physical examination was conducted to rule out any underlying conditions that may be contributing to her symptoms. The patient appeared anxious but calm, with no acute distress. Her vital signs were within normal limits: blood pressure 140/90 mmHg, pulse 80 beats per minute, respiratory rate 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 98% on room air. A chest examination revealed no abnormalities, including no wheezing or crackles. The patient's lungs were clear to auscultation.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation was made. The patient's age and history of smoking are consistent with this diagnosis.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient was prescribed a short-course inhaler therapy with fluticasone propionate 250 mcg twice daily for 7 days to help manage her symptoms. She was also advised to use a humidifier in her home to add moisture to the air, which can help reduce coughing and wheezing. The patient was instructed to avoid exposure to smoke and pollutants, and to maintain a regular exercise routine.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient is scheduled for follow-up in 2 weeks to reassess her symptoms and adjust her treatment plan as needed. She should contact the clinic if her symptoms worsen or if she experiences any new respiratory issues.

Note: The severity level of 5 indicates that the patient's condition is minor and self-limiting, but still warrants medical attention to ensure proper management and prevent complications.
