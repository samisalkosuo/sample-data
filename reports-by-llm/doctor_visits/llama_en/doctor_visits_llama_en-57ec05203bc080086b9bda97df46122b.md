**Visit Summary**

**Date:** 25.07.2025
**Location:** Kihniö Clinic
**Severity Level:** 3 (Urgent)

**Patient Information:**
Female, age 53

**Chief Complaint:**
The patient presented with a 2-day history of progressive left-sided chest pain, which worsened over the past 24 hours. She reported feeling short of breath and experiencing occasional coughing fits.

**History of Present Illness (HPI):**
The patient's symptoms began on July 23rd, after returning from a family vacation. Initially, she attributed her symptoms to a viral upper respiratory tract infection. However, as the pain worsened and breathing difficulties increased, she sought medical attention. The patient reported no recent travel history or exposure to potential allergens.

**Physical Examination Findings:**
Upon examination, the patient exhibited signs of respiratory distress, including bilateral wheezing (grade 3/5) and decreased lung sounds over the left lower lobe. Her oxygen saturation was 92% on room air. The patient's vital signs were as follows:

* Blood pressure: 140/90 mmHg
* Pulse: 110 beats per minute
* Temperature: 37.4°C (99.3°F)
* Respiratory rate: 24 breaths per minute

**Assessment / Diagnosis:**
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with possible pneumonia is suspected. Further testing, including chest radiography and possibly a computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest, may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.

**Plan / Treatment:**
The patient will be started on oxygen therapy via nasal cannula, with an initial flow rate of 4 liters per minute. She will also receive a prescription for oral corticosteroids (prednisone 40 mg daily) and a bronchodilator inhaler (albuterol 2 puffs every 4 hours as needed). The patient is advised to rest and avoid strenuous activities.

**Follow-up Instructions:**
The patient will be scheduled for follow-up in 7-10 days to reassess her symptoms and adjust treatment as necessary. She should return to the clinic if she experiences worsening shortness of breath, increased coughing fits, or fever above 38°C (100.4°F).
