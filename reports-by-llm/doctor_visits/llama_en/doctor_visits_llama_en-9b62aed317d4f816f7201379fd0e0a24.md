Visit Summary:

Date: January 2, 2024
Location: Keitele Clinic

Patient Information:
- Gender: Male
- Age: 72 years

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with complaints of progressive shortness of breath and fatigue over the past week.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient reported worsening symptoms over the past few days, which began with mild exertional dyspnea. He described feeling winded even when performing light activities such as walking or doing yard work. The patient also mentioned experiencing occasional chest discomfort that worsened with deep breathing. These symptoms have progressively worsened, leading to a decrease in his overall activity level.

Physical Examination Findings:
Given the severity of this case (Severity Level 3), the physical examination was conducted with caution and attention to detail. Vital signs were within normal limits, but the patient exhibited signs of mild respiratory distress, including bilateral wheezes and decreased breath sounds over the right lung base. The patient's oxygen saturation levels were 92% on room air.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
The patient's symptoms are consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation. Further diagnostic testing was not required due to the clinical presentation, but a chest X-ray and spirometry may be considered in the future for more precise diagnosis and management planning.

Plan / Treatment:
- The patient was prescribed a short course of oral corticosteroids (prednisone 20mg daily) to help manage inflammation.
- A bronchodilator inhaler (albuterol) was also prescribed to alleviate bronchospasm.
- The patient was advised to use his inhaler as directed and to avoid exposure to environmental irritants such as tobacco smoke, dust, or strong chemicals.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient is scheduled for a follow-up appointment in two weeks. During this visit, the patient's response to treatment will be assessed, and further management strategies may be discussed based on his progress. The patient was also advised to contact the clinic immediately if he experiences worsening symptoms, such as increased shortness of breath or chest pain.

Additional Recommendations:
- Encourage a healthy lifestyle, including regular exercise and a balanced diet.
- Advise the patient to avoid smoking and secondhand smoke exposure.
- Recommend that the patient consider pulmonary rehabilitation therapy for long-term management of COPD.
