Visit Summary:

Date: March 12, 2024
Location: Pornainen Clinic

Patient Information:
Female patient, age 87 years

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with complaints of worsening shortness of breath and fatigue over the past week.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient reported a gradual increase in difficulty breathing, particularly during exertion. She also experienced generalized fatigue, which has worsened over the past few days. The patient's symptoms began after a recent fall at home, where she sustained a minor injury to her left hip. Despite rest and physical therapy, her condition has not improved.

Physical Examination Findings:
Given the patient's age and severity level 4, the examination was focused on assessing respiratory function and overall stability. Vital signs were within normal limits. Oxygen saturation was 92% on room air. The patient's lungs were clear to auscultation, with no evidence of consolidation or wheezing. The patient's cardiovascular system was stable, with a regular rhythm and blood pressure 140/80 mmHg.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
The patient's presentation is consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation, likely precipitated by the recent fall and subsequent immobility. The patient's age and comorbidities also contribute to her overall risk for respiratory complications.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient was prescribed oxygen therapy via nasal cannula at 2 liters per minute, with a target saturation of 88-92%. She will be started on oral corticosteroids (prednisone) 40 mg daily for 5 days. The patient will also receive a prescription for albuterol inhaler as needed for acute symptoms.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient is scheduled to follow up with her primary care physician in one week to reassess her condition and adjust treatment as necessary. It is essential that the patient adheres to her medication regimen and follows oxygen therapy instructions carefully to prevent further deterioration.

Discharge Summary:
The patient was discharged home with a plan for close monitoring of her respiratory status, including daily pulse oximetry and regular follow-up appointments.
