**Visit Summary**

**Date:** August 30, 2024
**Location:** Jomala Clinic
**Patient Information:**
- **Gender:** Male
- **Age:** 97 years

**Chief Complaint:**
The patient presented with complaints of worsening shortness of breath and fatigue over the past week.

**History of Present Illness (HPI):**
The patient reported a gradual increase in difficulty breathing, particularly during exertion. He also mentioned feeling increasingly fatigued, which has resulted in reduced mobility and decreased appetite. The patient's symptoms worsened over the past few days, leading him to seek medical attention.

**Physical Examination Findings:**
Given the patient's age and severity level of 1 (immediate life threat), a thorough examination was conducted with utmost urgency. Vital signs revealed tachypnea (rapid breathing rate) at 24 breaths per minute, tachycardia (rapid heart rate) at 120 beats per minute, and low oxygen saturation levels at 88%. The patient's skin appeared pale, and he exhibited signs of dehydration.

**Assessment / Diagnosis:**
The patient's presentation is consistent with acute decompensated heart failure. Given his age and severity level, immediate attention is required to stabilize the patient.

**Plan / Treatment:**
- **Oxygen Therapy:** Administered via non-rebreather mask at 6 liters per minute.
- **Intravenous Fluids:** Started with 500 mL of normal saline over 15 minutes, followed by 250 mL of lactated Ringer's solution every 10 minutes as needed to maintain urine output.
- **Oxygen Saturation Monitoring:** Continuously monitored via pulse oximeter.
- **Cardiac Glycosides:** Administered intravenously at a dose of 0.25 mg/kg as needed for heart rate control.
- **Beta Blockers:** Started with a low dose of metoprolol succinate to reduce heart rate and improve cardiac output.

**Follow-up Instructions:**
The patient will be admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for close monitoring and further management. The patient's family has been informed, and they are asked to contact the clinic immediately if there is any change in the patient's condition. A follow-up appointment will be scheduled within 24 hours to reassess the patient's status.

**Additional Notes:**
The patient's rapid decline necessitates immediate attention to prevent further deterioration. Close monitoring of vital signs and cardiac function is crucial to ensure optimal management of this acute decompensation event.
