Visit Summary:

Date: 19.01.2025
Location: Jyväskylä Clinic

Patient Information:
Male, 42 years old

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with complaints of worsening back pain and fatigue over the past week, which has significantly impacted his daily activities.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient reported a gradual increase in lower back pain, radiating to his left buttock, accompanied by morning stiffness. He also experienced fatigue, particularly after physical activity, and reported difficulty sleeping due to discomfort. The pain worsened over the past week, with an exacerbation during heavy lifting at work on Tuesday.

Physical Examination Findings:
Given the severity level of 2, the patient's physical examination revealed tenderness in the left lumbar region, with moderate stiffness upon movement. Range of motion was slightly limited, but no neurological deficits were noted. The patient's vital signs were within normal limits.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
The patient's presentation is consistent with chronic lower back pain, likely related to a musculoskeletal issue or possibly a herniated disc. Further evaluation, including imaging studies (e.g., MRI), may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential causes.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient was prescribed 500mg of ibuprofen three times daily for pain management and instructed to maintain good posture, engage in regular exercise, and avoid heavy lifting. A referral to a specialist (orthopedic surgeon) will be made for further evaluation and potential intervention.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient is advised to follow up with the specialist within two weeks for re-evaluation and possible imaging studies. In the meantime, he should continue to take his medication as directed and report any worsening symptoms or concerns to the clinic.

Note: The severity level of 2 indicates a potential life threat due to the patient's increasing pain and discomfort, which may impact his daily activities and overall well-being.
