Location: Laukaa Clinic

Patient Information:
- Gender: Male
- Age: 94 years

Severity Level: 2 (Emergent â€“ potential life threat)

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with difficulty breathing and a feeling of impending doom, which he described as "I can't catch my breath."

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient reported that his symptoms started approximately 30 minutes ago. He stated that he was sitting in his armchair when he suddenly felt an intense sensation of shortness of breath. The sensation worsened over the next few minutes, and he became increasingly anxious. He denied any recent travel or exposure to potential allergens.

Physical Examination Findings:
Upon examination, the patient appeared anxious and agitated. His oxygen saturation was 92% on room air, indicating mild hypoxia. His respiratory rate was 24 breaths per minute, which is elevated for his age group. The rest of his vital signs were within normal limits. A thorough physical examination revealed no acute abnormalities.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
Given the patient's age and symptoms, a primary concern for respiratory failure due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation or another underlying condition cannot be ruled out. Further diagnostic testing is required to determine the cause of his symptoms.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient was started on supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula at 4 liters per minute and placed on a pulse oximeter for monitoring. He was also prescribed a short course of prednisone (40 mg daily) for potential COPD exacerbation, as well as a prescription for albuterol inhaler for future use.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient is to follow up with his primary care physician within 3 days to reassess his condition and adjust treatment plan as necessary. The patient's family members are also advised to monitor his oxygen saturation levels closely and seek immediate medical attention if they notice any worsening of symptoms.

Additional Recommendations:
Given the patient's age, it is essential to consider palliative care options to ensure his comfort and quality of life. A referral to a geriatrician for further evaluation and management will be made as necessary.
