Patient Information:
Female patient, age 57

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with complaints of worsening back pain and difficulty walking due to a recent fall at home.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient reported that her back pain began 2 weeks ago after a minor fall. Initially, she thought it was just a sprain, but the pain has progressively worsened over time. She described the pain as a dull ache, worse in the morning and improving with movement. The patient also mentioned difficulty walking due to sharp pains in her lower back, which have become more frequent and severe over the past week.

Physical Examination Findings:
Given the severity level of 5 (non-urgent), the physical examination was focused on assessing the patient's overall condition and ruling out any acute complications. The patient presented with a normal vital sign profile, but tenderness was noted in the lower back region. No acute trauma or deformity was observed.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
Based on the patient's history and physical examination findings, the diagnosis is chronic low back pain secondary to a minor fall. Further evaluation revealed no acute complications, such as fractures or nerve compression, that would require immediate attention.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient will be prescribed 500mg of ibuprofen twice daily for pain management and 200mg of acetaminophen once daily for additional pain relief. A referral to the orthopedic department for further evaluation and potential physical therapy is recommended. The patient is advised to continue with her usual activities, avoiding heavy lifting or bending.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient should follow up with the primary care physician in 2 weeks to reassess her condition and adjust treatment as needed. In the meantime, she can contact the clinic for any concerns or questions regarding her medication regimen.
