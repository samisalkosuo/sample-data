**Visit Summary**

**Date:** 27.04.2024
**Location:** Jomala Clinic

**Patient Information:**
- **Gender:** Female
- **Age:** 92 years

**Severity Level:** 5 (Non-urgent â€“ minor complaints)

**Chief Complaint:**
The patient presented with a complaint of mild left-sided facial paresthesia, which she described as a "tingling" sensation. She reported that this symptom has been present for approximately 2 weeks and has not significantly impacted her daily activities.

**History of Present Illness (HPI):**
The patient's symptoms began 2 weeks ago, with the onset being gradual. The paresthesia is primarily localized to the left side of her face, affecting her ability to taste and feel sensations in that area. She denied any recent trauma or exposure to toxins that could have caused these symptoms. Her past medical history includes hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and osteoporosis.

**Physical Examination Findings:**
Given the patient's age and the nature of her complaint, a thorough neurological examination was performed. The left facial nerve was assessed for weakness or paralysis, but no deficits were noted. A simple visual inspection revealed no signs of skin lesions or other abnormalities that could explain the paresthesia. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.

**Assessment / Diagnosis:**
Based on the patient's symptoms and the absence of any neurological deficits, a diagnosis of mild peripheral neuropathy is considered. This condition is often associated with aging and can be exacerbated by factors such as diabetes or vitamin deficiencies. Given her stable medical history, further diagnostic testing (e.g., nerve conduction studies) may not be immediately necessary.

**Plan / Treatment:**
The patient was advised to maintain a balanced diet rich in vitamins B12 and E, which are known to support nerve health. She was also recommended to avoid smoking and limit alcohol consumption as these factors can exacerbate peripheral neuropathy. The patient will be scheduled for follow-up appointments every 6 months to monitor her condition.

**Follow-up Instructions:**
The patient is advised to return to the clinic in 6 months for a follow-up appointment. During this visit, we will assess the progression of her symptoms and consider further management if necessary. In the meantime, she should maintain good hygiene practices and avoid any activities that could exacerbate her condition.
