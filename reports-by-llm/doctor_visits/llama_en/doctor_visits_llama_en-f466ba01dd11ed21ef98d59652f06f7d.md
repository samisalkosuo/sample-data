Visit Summary:

Patient Name: Ms. Maria Rodriguez
Date of Visit: August 12, 2023
Location: Pietarsaari Clinic

Chief Complaint:
Ms. Rodriguez presented with complaints of worsening back pain and fatigue over the past few weeks, which has significantly impacted her daily activities.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient reported a gradual increase in lower back pain, radiating to her left buttock, accompanied by morning stiffness that lasts for approximately 30 minutes. She also experiences fatigue, particularly after physical activity, and reports difficulty sleeping due to discomfort. The onset of symptoms began 6 weeks ago, with no significant trauma or injury preceding them.

Physical Examination Findings:
Given the severity level of 4, the patient's presentation is stable but requires additional resources for optimal management. Vital signs were within normal limits (BP: 120/80 mmHg, HR: 72 bpm, RR: 12 breaths/min). The patient exhibited tenderness to palpation in the left lumbar region and mild stiffness of the spine. No acute distress or neurological deficits were noted.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
Based on the patient's presentation, a diagnosis of chronic lower back pain with associated fatigue is made. Further evaluation may include imaging studies (e.g., X-rays or MRI) to rule out underlying conditions such as disc herniation or spinal stenosis.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient will be prescribed a combination of analgesics and anti-inflammatory medications to manage her symptoms. She will also be referred for physical therapy to improve mobility and strength, with follow-up appointments scheduled every 4 weeks. Additional recommendations include maintaining a healthy diet, engaging in regular exercise, and practicing stress-reducing techniques.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient is advised to return to the clinic in 6 weeks for reassessment of her symptoms and adjustment of treatment as needed. She should also schedule an appointment with her primary care physician within the next 2 months to discuss further management options.
