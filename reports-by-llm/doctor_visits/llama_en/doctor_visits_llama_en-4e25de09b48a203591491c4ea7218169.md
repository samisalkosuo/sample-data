**Visit Summary**

**Date:** August 5, 2025
**Location:** Heinola Clinic
**Severity Level:** 3 (Urgent)

**Patient Information:**
- **Gender:** Male
- **Age:** 55 years old

**Chief Complaint:**
The patient presented with complaints of progressive dyspnea and orthopnea over the past two weeks, exacerbated by exertion. He reported feeling fatigued and having difficulty sleeping.

**History of Present Illness (HPI):**
The patient's symptoms began approximately two weeks ago, worsening gradually over time. He described his breathing as labored and reported experiencing shortness of breath even at rest. Orthopnea was noted, where he feels the need to sit upright to alleviate dyspnea. The patient also mentioned feeling fatigued and having difficulty sleeping, which has further exacerbated his symptoms.

**Physical Examination Findings:**
Upon examination, the patient exhibited signs consistent with heart failure (HF). His jugular venous pressure (JVP) was elevated at 12 cm H2O, indicating right-sided HF. The patient's lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally, but he did exhibit a harsh, blowing murmur best heard at the left sternal border, consistent with mitral regurgitation. His oxygen saturation was 92% on room air.

**Assessment / Diagnosis:**
Given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of heart failure (HF) with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is made. The presence of orthopnea, dyspnea at rest, elevated JVP, and mitral regurgitation supports this diagnosis.

**Plan / Treatment:**
The patient will be started on furosemide 40 mg orally twice daily for symptomatic relief of edema and shortness of breath. He will also receive lisinopril 10 mg orally once daily to manage hypertension and reduce the workload on his heart. The patient is advised to maintain a low-sodium diet, increase fluid intake, and avoid strenuous activities until further evaluation can be conducted.

**Follow-up Instructions:**
The patient is scheduled for follow-up in two weeks to assess the efficacy of treatment and monitor for any signs of worsening HF or other complications. In the meantime, he should report any changes in his symptoms to the clinic promptly.

**Additional Recommendations:**

- The patient will need further evaluation by a cardiologist to determine the underlying cause of his heart failure.
- A stress test may be recommended to assess the patient's cardiac function and guide further management.
- Lifestyle modifications such as regular exercise, weight loss if applicable, and smoking cessation are encouraged to improve overall health.
