Visit Summary:

Date: 15.04.2024
Location: Lapinj√§rvi Clinic

Patient Information:
- Gender: Female
- Age: 76 years

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with complaints of progressive shortness of breath and fatigue over the past week, which have worsened over the past two days.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient reported feeling increasingly short of breath, even when performing light activities such as walking or doing household chores. She also experienced fatigue, particularly in the morning, which has made it difficult for her to perform daily tasks. The patient denied any chest pain or coughing up blood. Her symptoms worsened over the past two days, prompting her to seek medical attention.

Physical Examination Findings:
Given the severity level of 5 (non-urgent), the physical examination was relatively unremarkable. Vital signs were within normal limits: blood pressure 140/90 mmHg, heart rate 80 beats per minute, respiratory rate 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 98% on room air. The patient's lungs were clear to auscultation, and there were no signs of edema or cyanosis.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
The patient's symptoms are consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation, given her history of smoking and respiratory symptoms. Further diagnostic testing is not immediately necessary due to the non-urgent nature of this visit.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient was prescribed a short course of oral corticosteroids (prednisone 20mg daily for 5 days) to help manage her COPD exacerbation. She was also advised on proper inhaler technique and encouraged to use her inhalers as directed. The patient's family member was instructed on how to recognize signs of worsening symptoms, such as increased shortness of breath or confusion.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient is scheduled for a follow-up appointment in two weeks to reassess her condition and adjust treatment as needed. In the meantime, she should continue to use her inhalers as prescribed and contact the clinic if her symptoms worsen or do not improve with treatment.
