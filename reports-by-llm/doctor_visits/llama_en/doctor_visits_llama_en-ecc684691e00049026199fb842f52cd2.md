Location: Hyvinkää Clinic

Patient Information:
Male Patient, Age 13

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with complaints of worsening abdominal pain and vomiting over the past 24 hours.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient reported a gradual increase in abdominal pain, starting from mild discomfort to severe cramping. He also experienced nausea and vomiting, which worsened throughout the day. The pain was described as sharp and stabbing, located primarily in the upper right quadrant of his abdomen. The patient had no fever or recent travel history.

Physical Examination Findings:
Given the severity level of 5 (non-urgent), the physical examination was relatively unremarkable. However, upon abdominal palpation, tenderness was noted in the right upper quadrant, and a slight guarding reaction was observed. Bowel sounds were present but not significantly increased. The patient's vital signs were stable.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of acute appendicitis is suspected. Further diagnostic testing, such as imaging studies (e.g., ultrasound), may be necessary to confirm this diagnosis.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient will be started on antibiotics (e.g., ciprofloxacin) to cover for potential bacterial infection. He will also receive pain management with acetaminophen or ibuprofen as needed. The patient is advised to rest and avoid strenuous activities. Follow-up appointments are scheduled for 2 weeks post-discharge.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient should return to the clinic in 2 weeks for a follow-up appointment to assess the resolution of symptoms and evaluate for any complications. In the meantime, if the patient experiences worsening abdominal pain, fever, or signs of peritonitis (e.g., severe tenderness, guarding), he should contact his healthcare provider immediately.

Note: The severity level of 5 indicates that this is a minor complaint with no immediate life-threatening situation. However, it's essential to monitor the patient's condition closely and follow up as scheduled to ensure proper management and prevent potential complications.
