Visit Summary:

Patient Name: Juhani K.
Date of Visit: February 9, 2023
Location: Petäjävesi Clinic

Chief Complaint:
Mr. K presented with complaints of worsening back pain and limited mobility over the past few weeks.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient reported a gradual increase in his lower back pain, which started as a dull ache but has progressed to a sharp, stabbing sensation. He also experiences numbness and tingling in his left leg, particularly in the calf area. Mr. K mentioned that he has difficulty walking and maintaining balance due to the pain. The symptoms worsened over the past week, prompting him to seek medical attention.

Physical Examination Findings:
Given the severity level of 4, the physical examination was focused on assessing the patient's overall condition and identifying potential complications. Vital signs were within normal limits. The patient exhibited tenderness in the lower back region, particularly in the L5-S1 interspace. Muscle strength was decreased in the left leg, with a notable weakness in plantarflexion. Reflexes were diminished in the left lower extremity.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of lumbar disc herniation at the L5-S1 level is suspected. The patient's age and occupation ( manual laborer) contribute to the likelihood of this condition. Further evaluation, including imaging studies, will be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient was prescribed 500mg of ibuprofen three times daily for pain management and inflammation reduction. A referral to an orthopedic specialist for further evaluation and potential surgical intervention is planned. The patient is advised to continue with his current physical therapy regimen and attend follow-up appointments as scheduled.

Follow-up Instructions:
Mr. K is scheduled for a follow-up appointment in two weeks to reassess the patient's condition and adjust treatment as needed. He is also instructed to maintain good posture, avoid heavy lifting, and engage in regular exercise to alleviate symptoms.
