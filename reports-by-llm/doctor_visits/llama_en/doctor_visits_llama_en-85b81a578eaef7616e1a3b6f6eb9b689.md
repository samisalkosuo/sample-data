**Visit Summary**

**Date:** November 29, 2023
**Location:** Alavieska Clinic
**Severity Level:** 3 (Urgent)

**Patient Information:**
Male patient, age 5 years.

**Chief Complaint:**
The patient presented with a 2-day history of fever, vomiting, and abdominal pain. The parents reported that the child's condition worsened over the past 24 hours, leading to increased irritability and refusal to drink fluids.

**History of Present Illness (HPI):**
The patient was brought to the clinic by his parents, who stated that he had a mild fever on the first day of illness. The fever resolved spontaneously, but the child developed abdominal pain and vomiting. Over the past 24 hours, the symptoms have worsened, with the child becoming increasingly irritable and refusing to drink fluids.

**Physical Examination Findings:**
The patient appeared lethargic and uncomfortable during the examination. His temperature was 39°C (102°F), blood pressure was 90/60 mmHg, and pulse was 120/min. Abdominal tenderness was noted in the lower quadrant, with guarding present. The liver was palpable 2 cm below the costal margin.

**Assessment / Diagnosis:**
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of acute gastroenteritis is suspected. The presence of fever, vomiting, abdominal pain, and abdominal tenderness suggests an infectious etiology. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of the illness.

**Plan / Treatment:**
The patient was started on oral rehydration therapy (ORT) with a pediatric solution, as recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). Antibiotics were not prescribed due to the lack of evidence for their efficacy in this case. The child will be monitored closely for signs of dehydration and sepsis.

**Follow-up Instructions:**
The patient is scheduled for follow-up in 2 days to assess for improvement or worsening of symptoms. Parents are advised to continue ORT as directed, and to seek immediate medical attention if the child's condition worsens or shows signs of dehydration (e.g., excessive thirst, dark urine, decreased urine output).

**Additional Notes:**
The patient's parents were educated on proper hygiene practices, including handwashing with soap and water, to prevent further transmission of the illness.
