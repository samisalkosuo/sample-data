**Date:** April 20, 2024
**Location:** Lestijärvi Clinic

**Patient Information:**
- **Gender:** Male
- **Age:** 64 years old

**Chief Complaint:**
The patient presented with complaints of progressive difficulty breathing over the past week, exacerbated by exertion. He reported feeling short of breath at rest and during light physical activity.

**History of Present Illness (HPI):**
The patient's symptoms began approximately one week ago, worsening gradually over time. He described his breathing as labored and noted a persistent cough with yellow sputum production. The patient has no significant history of respiratory disease and is a non-smoker. He has been experiencing fatigue and mild chest discomfort.

**Physical Examination Findings:**
Given the severity level of 3, the physical examination findings were focused on assessing for signs of respiratory distress and potential cardiac involvement. Vital signs revealed a temperature of 37.5°C (99.5°F), blood pressure 140/90 mmHg, pulse 110 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation 92% on room air. The patient exhibited bilateral wheezes and crackles in the lungs, with increased respiratory rate and use of accessory muscles during breathing.

**Assessment / Diagnosis:**
The patient's presentation is consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation, likely secondary to viral infection. Further diagnostic testing was not deemed necessary due to the clinical context and severity level.

**Plan / Treatment:**
- The patient was prescribed a short course of oral corticosteroids for COPD exacerbation.
- A prescription for a bronchodilator inhaler (salbutamol) was also provided, with instructions on proper use.
- The patient was advised to continue his usual medication regimen and avoid smoking.

**Follow-up Instructions:**
The patient is scheduled for follow-up in two weeks. In the meantime, he should monitor his symptoms closely and contact the clinic if they worsen or do not improve with treatment.
