Patient Information:
Male, 31 years old

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with complaints of progressive left-sided chest pain radiating to the back, which worsened over the past 24 hours. He reported no shortness of breath or dizziness.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient described a gradual increase in discomfort starting from the evening before, which intensified throughout the night. The pain is sharp and stabbing, with an occasional dull ache. He denied any recent trauma or strenuous activity that could have precipitated the pain. The patient also reported a mild fever of 38.5°C (101.3°F) and a general feeling of malaise.

Physical Examination Findings:
Vital signs: Blood pressure 140/90 mmHg, pulse 100 bpm, respiratory rate 20 breaths/min, temperature 38.5°C (101.3°F). The patient appeared anxious but was cooperative during the examination. On physical examination, the left chest wall was tender to palpation, with a slight indentation in the area of the pain. The lungs were clear bilaterally, and the heart sounds were normal.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
Given the severity level of 2 (Emergent – potential life threat), the patient's presentation is concerning for an acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Further evaluation is necessary to determine the underlying cause of the chest pain.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient was started on aspirin 300mg orally, and a beta-blocker (metoprolol) 50mg orally was prescribed. He was also advised to take nitroglycerin sublingually as needed for angina symptoms. The patient will undergo an electrocardiogram (ECG) within the next 24 hours to assess for signs of ischemia or infarction.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient is scheduled for a follow-up appointment in one week to reassess his condition and adjust treatment as necessary. He should return to the clinic if he experiences worsening chest pain, shortness of breath, or any other concerning symptoms. The patient's family members were educated on basic life support techniques, including CPR.

Discharge Instructions:
The patient was advised to avoid heavy lifting, bending, or strenuous activity for the next 24 hours. He should also avoid smoking and limit his alcohol intake.
