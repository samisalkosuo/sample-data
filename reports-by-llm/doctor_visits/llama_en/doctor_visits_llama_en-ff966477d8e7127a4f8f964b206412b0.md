**Location:** Nurmes Clinic
**Patient Information:**
- **Gender:** Male
- **Age:** 94 years old

**Chief Complaint:**
The patient presented with complaints of worsening shortness of breath and fatigue over the past week, which have significantly impacted his daily activities.

**History of Present Illness (HPI):**
The patient reported a gradual increase in dyspnea, particularly during exertion, and an overall feeling of exhaustion. He also mentioned experiencing orthopnea, where he feels uncomfortable lying down due to shortness of breath. The symptoms worsened over the past week, leading him to seek medical attention.

**Physical Examination Findings:**
Given the patient's age and severity level (5), a thorough physical examination was conducted with caution to avoid exacerbating any potential conditions. Vital signs were stable, but oxygen saturation was slightly low at 92% on room air. The patient exhibited signs of frailty, including decreased muscle mass and poor skin turgor. Cardiovascular examination revealed no acute abnormalities, but there was a notable decrease in peripheral pulses.

Considering the patient's age, symptoms, and physical examination findings, the primary diagnosis is chronic heart failure with exacerbation. The patient likely has underlying coronary artery disease contributing to his condition.

**Plan / Treatment:**
- **Medications:** The patient will be started on 25mg of furosemide orally twice daily for edema management and 50mg of metoprolol succinate orally once daily for heart rate control.
- **Monitoring:** Regular monitoring of vital signs, oxygen saturation, and electrolytes is recommended.

**Follow-up Instructions:**
The patient will be scheduled for a follow-up appointment in two weeks to reassess his condition. In the meantime, he should continue to take his medications as prescribed and report any changes in symptoms or worsening conditions immediately.
