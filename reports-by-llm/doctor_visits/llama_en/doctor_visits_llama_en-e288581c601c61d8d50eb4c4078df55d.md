Visit Summary:

Date: 15.07.2025
Location: Mustasaari Clinic

Patient Information:
- Gender: Female
- Age: 29 years

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with a complaint of worsening fatigue and shortness of breath over the past week, which has significantly impacted her daily activities.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient reported feeling increasingly fatigued, particularly after minimal exertion, and experienced shortness of breath during periods of rest. These symptoms worsened over the past week, with no apparent precipitating factors. The patient also mentioned a mild cough, which was described as dry and non-productive.

Physical Examination Findings:
Given the severity level of 1, the physical examination findings were focused on identifying any immediate life-threatening conditions. Vital signs revealed a blood pressure of 110/70 mmHg, pulse rate of 90 beats per minute, oxygen saturation of 98% on room air, and temperature of 37Â°C. The patient's lungs were clear to auscultation, with no wheezes or crackles noted. The heart was also found to be within normal limits.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of acute exacerbation of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) was made. This condition is characterized by persistent and profound fatigue that is not alleviated by rest and interferes with daily activities. The shortness of breath may be indicative of autonomic dysfunction, which is common in CFS patients.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient will be prescribed a combination of medications to manage her symptoms, including amantadine 100 mg orally once daily for fatigue and shortness of breath, and pregabalin 75 mg orally three times daily for muscle cramps. The patient will also be advised on lifestyle modifications such as increasing fluid intake, avoiding heavy lifting, and engaging in gentle exercises.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient is scheduled to follow up with the clinic in two weeks for a re-evaluation of her symptoms and medication efficacy. In the meantime, she should report any changes in her condition or concerns to the healthcare provider promptly.
