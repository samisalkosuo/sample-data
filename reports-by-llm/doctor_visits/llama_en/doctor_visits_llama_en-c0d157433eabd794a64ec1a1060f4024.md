Visit Summary:

Patient Name: [Redacted]
Date of Visit: 17.04.2024
Location: Ilomantsi Clinic

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with complaints of abdominal pain and vomiting, which started approximately 2 hours prior to arrival.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient reported that she had been experiencing mild to moderate abdominal pain, primarily located in the upper right quadrant. The pain was described as crampy and intermittent, worsening over time. She also reported nausea and vomiting, with the first episode occurring about 30 minutes ago. There were no fever or blood in her stool. The patient denied any recent travel or exposure to sick individuals.

Physical Examination Findings:
Given the severity level of 5 (non-urgent), the physical examination was relatively unremarkable. Vital signs were within normal limits, with a temperature of 36.5Â°C, blood pressure of 110/70 mmHg, pulse of 80 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's abdomen was soft and non-tender to palpation, with no guarding or rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds were present but not excessively active.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of acute gastroenteritis (mild) was made. The cause is unknown, but likely viral in nature given the absence of fever and blood in stool.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient will be prescribed loperamide 2 mg orally every 4 hours as needed for nausea and vomiting, and an oral rehydration solution (ORS) to manage dehydration. She will also receive a prescription for acetaminophen 500 mg orally twice daily for pain management. The patient is advised to rest and avoid solid foods until symptoms improve.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient should follow up with the clinic in 3-5 days to assess improvement and adjust treatment as needed. If symptoms worsen or do not improve, a return visit will be scheduled accordingly.
