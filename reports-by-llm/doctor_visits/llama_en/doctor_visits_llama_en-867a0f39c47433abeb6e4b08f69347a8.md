**Date:** 13.03.2024
**Location:** Kuusamo Clinic
**Severity Level:** 2 (Emergent â€“ potential life threat)

**Patient Information:**
- **Gender:** Male
- **Age:** 58 years

**Chief Complaint:**
The patient presented with a 2-day history of progressive dyspnea, orthopnea, and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. He reported feeling short of breath at rest and experiencing episodes of severe difficulty breathing while lying down.

**History of Present Illness (HPI):**
The patient's symptoms began approximately 48 hours ago, with an initial episode of coughing up pink, frothy sputum. Since then, his respiratory symptoms have worsened, with increasing shortness of breath and orthopnea. He has also experienced nocturnal awakenings due to difficulty breathing. The patient reports no fever or chest pain.

**Physical Examination Findings:**
Upon examination, the patient exhibited signs consistent with congestive heart failure (CHF), including bilateral jugular venous distension (JVD) and a loud S4 heart sound. His respiratory rate was elevated at 24 breaths per minute, and his oxygen saturation was 92% on room air. The patient's lungs were clear to auscultation.

**Assessment / Diagnosis:**
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) is suspected. Further evaluation with echocardiography and laboratory tests will be necessary to confirm this diagnosis.

**Plan / Treatment:**
The patient was started on intravenous furosemide 40 mg IV q6h and nitroglycerin 3 mg sublingual q5min as needed for angina. He was also prescribed oxygen therapy via nasal cannula at 4 L/min and advised to remain in bed with legs elevated 30-40 degrees.

**Follow-up Instructions:**
The patient will be seen in the clinic within 24 hours for re-evaluation of his condition, echocardiography, and laboratory tests. He is instructed to follow a low-sodium diet and avoid heavy lifting or strenuous activities until further notice. The patient's family members are advised to monitor his oxygen saturation levels closely and report any changes to the healthcare provider.

**Additional Notes:**
The patient's symptoms suggest a potential life-threatening condition, and close monitoring is necessary to prevent further deterioration.
