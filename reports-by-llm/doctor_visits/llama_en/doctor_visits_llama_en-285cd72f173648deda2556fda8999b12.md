Patient Information:
Male patient, 88 years of age

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with complaints of worsening shortness of breath and fatigue over the past week.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient reported a gradual increase in difficulty breathing, particularly during exertion. He also mentioned feeling increasingly fatigued, which has affected his ability to perform daily activities. The patient's symptoms worsened over the past few days, leading him to seek medical attention. He denied any recent respiratory infections or exposure to environmental toxins.

Physical Examination Findings:
Given the patient's age and severity level (5), a comprehensive physical examination was performed with caution to avoid exacerbating his condition. Vital signs were stable, but oxygen saturation was slightly low at 92% on room air. The patient's pulse was 100 bpm, and blood pressure was 160/90 mmHg. Lung sounds were clear bilaterally, but there was a slight decrease in breath sounds over the left lower lung field. The patient's skin was pale, and he had a mild rash on his left arm.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation with possible pneumonia was made. The patient's age and comorbidities also contributed to the severity of his condition.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient was started on oxygen therapy via nasal cannula at 2 liters per minute. He was prescribed oral antibiotics (amoxicillin-clavulanate) for suspected pneumonia, as well as a bronchodilator inhaler (albuterol) to manage symptoms. The patient was also advised to rest and avoid strenuous activities.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient is scheduled for follow-up in 2 weeks to reassess his condition and adjust treatment as needed. He should continue to use his inhaler as prescribed and report any worsening symptoms or concerns to the clinic.
