She also experienced fatigue, particularly after physical activity, and had difficulty sleeping due to discomfort. The pain worsened over the past week, making it difficult for her to perform daily tasks.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient was prescribed ibuprofen 400mg orally twice daily for pain management and acetaminophen 500mg orally as needed for fever reduction. A physical therapy referral was made to address muscle strength and flexibility issues. The patient was advised to maintain a regular exercise routine, including low-impact aerobics and stretching exercises.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient is scheduled for follow-up in two weeks to reassess pain levels and progress. She is instructed to report any worsening symptoms or concerns to the clinic promptly.
