Date: August 2, 2025
Location: Orimattila Clinic
Severity Level: 4

Patient Information:
Female patient, age 96 years

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with complaints of worsening shortness of breath and fatigue over the past week.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient reported that her shortness of breath worsened significantly over the past few days, making it difficult for her to perform daily activities such as dressing and grooming. She also experienced increased fatigue, which limited her ability to engage in her usual hobbies. The patient denied any recent respiratory infections or exposure to environmental toxins.

Physical Examination Findings:
Given the patient's age and severity level, a thorough physical examination was performed with caution to avoid exacerbating any potential underlying conditions. Vital signs were stable, with a blood pressure of 140/80 mmHg, pulse of 88 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. The patient's lungs were clear to auscultation, and the chest X-ray showed no acute abnormalities. A thorough neurological examination revealed no focal deficits.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
The patient's presentation is consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation, given her history of smoking and worsening symptoms. The patient was also found to have a mild left ventricular hypertrophy on the echocardiogram, which may be contributing to her shortness of breath.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient was started on oxygen therapy via nasal cannula at 2 liters per minute, with close monitoring for any signs of desaturation. She was prescribed oral corticosteroids (prednisone) 40 mg daily for 5 days and a bronchodilator inhaler (albuterol) as needed. The patient's family member was educated on the importance of proper medication adherence and follow-up appointments.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient is scheduled to follow up with her primary care physician in 2 weeks for further evaluation and adjustment of treatment plan as needed. It is essential that she adheres to her medication regimen and attends all scheduled appointments to ensure optimal management of her condition.

Discharge Summary:
The patient was discharged home with instructions on oxygen therapy, medication adherence, and follow-up appointments. Her family member was provided with contact information for the clinic and emergency services in case of any further complications.
