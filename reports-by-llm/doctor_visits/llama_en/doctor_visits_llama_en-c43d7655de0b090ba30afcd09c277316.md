Date: March 27, 2024
Location: Hyrynsalmi Clinic

Patient Information:
Male patient, aged 75 years

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with complaints of progressive difficulty breathing and fatigue over the past week.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient reported a gradual increase in shortness of breath, particularly during exertion, which has worsened over the past few days. He also experiences fatigue, which is affecting his daily activities. The patient denied any recent travel or exposure to new environments that could have triggered these symptoms.

Physical Examination Findings:
Given the severity level of 2 (Emergent – potential life threat), a thorough physical examination was conducted. Vital signs revealed a temperature of 37.5°C, blood pressure 140/90 mmHg, and oxygen saturation 92% on room air. The patient's respiratory rate was 24 breaths per minute, with a slightly increased rate compared to his baseline. Lung sounds were clear bilaterally, but there was a noticeable decrease in lung expansion.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
The patient's symptoms are consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation, likely triggered by a viral infection. The presence of fatigue and shortness of breath suggests that the patient is experiencing significant respiratory distress.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient was prescribed oral corticosteroids (prednisone 40mg daily) to reduce inflammation in the lungs. He will also receive oxygen therapy via nasal cannula, with an initial flow rate of 4 liters per minute and titrated as needed to maintain a saturation level above 90%. The patient's primary care physician will schedule follow-up appointments to monitor his condition and adjust treatment as necessary.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient is advised to return to the clinic in 2 weeks for further evaluation. In the meantime, he should continue to use his inhaler as prescribed and report any worsening symptoms or concerns to the office. The patient's family members are also encouraged to seek immediate medical attention if they notice any significant changes in his condition.

Discharge Instructions:
The patient was discharged with a prescription for oral corticosteroids and oxygen therapy. He is advised to follow a healthy diet, stay hydrated, and avoid strenuous activities until further notice.
