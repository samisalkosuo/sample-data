Patient Information:
Gender: Female
Age: 83 years

Severity Level: 3 (Urgent)

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with a 2-day history of worsening shortness of breath, fatigue, and orthopnea. She reported feeling increasingly short of wind and having difficulty breathing while lying down.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient's symptoms began 2 days ago, after returning from a recent hospitalization for pneumonia. Since then, her condition has progressively worsened. She reports experiencing chest discomfort and coughing up pink, frothy sputum. Her oxygen saturation levels have been consistently below 90% on room air.

Physical Examination Findings:
Vital signs: Blood pressure 140/80 mmHg, pulse 100/min, respiratory rate 24/min, oxygen saturation 85% on room air.
Physical examination revealed bilateral lung congestion and crackles bilaterally. The patient's jugular venous distension was noted, indicating possible fluid overload.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
Based on the patient's history and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) is suspected. The patient's symptoms and signs are consistent with fluid overload and pulmonary congestion, which are common complications of ADHF.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient will be admitted to the hospital for close monitoring and management of her condition. She will receive oxygen therapy, diuretics, and vasodilators to alleviate symptoms and improve cardiac function. The patient's oxygen saturation levels will be closely monitored, and she will be considered for mechanical ventilation if necessary.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient will be followed up with the cardiologist within 24 hours to discuss her treatment plan and adjust medications as needed. She is advised to report any worsening symptoms or concerns to the healthcare team promptly.

Discharge Instructions:
The patient will be discharged home once her condition stabilizes, provided she can safely manage her medication regimen and follow-up appointments.
