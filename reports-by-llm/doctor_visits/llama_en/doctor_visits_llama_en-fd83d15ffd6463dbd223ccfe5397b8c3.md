**Location:** Uurainen Clinic
**Severity Level:** 5 (Non-urgent â€“ minor complaints)

**Patient Information:**
Male patient, age 78 years.

**Chief Complaint:**
The patient presented with a complaint of mild left-sided chest discomfort that started 2 days ago. He reported feeling a bit short of breath and experiencing occasional coughing fits.

**History of Present Illness (HPI):**
The patient described the onset of his symptoms as gradual, starting with a dull ache in his left chest that worsened over time. He mentioned that he has been experiencing some fatigue and mild difficulty breathing during exertion. The patient denied any fever, chills, or recent travel history.

**Physical Examination Findings:**
Upon examination, the patient appeared alert and oriented. His vital signs were within normal limits. The physical examination revealed a slightly enlarged left supraclavicular lymph node (2 cm x 1 cm) without any other notable findings. A chest radiograph was ordered to further evaluate his symptoms.

**Assessment / Diagnosis:**
Based on the patient's presentation, history, and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of mild pulmonary embolism with possible left-sided pleural effusion is suspected. The enlarged lymph node may be indicative of an underlying inflammatory process or malignancy.

**Plan / Treatment:**
The patient was started on 75 mg/day aspirin for antiplatelet effects and 500 mg/day warfarin to prevent further clot formation. A low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) infusion will be administered in the hospital setting for the next 24-48 hours. The patient will also receive oxygen therapy as needed and be monitored for any signs of respiratory distress.

**Follow-up Instructions:**
The patient is scheduled for follow-up in 2 weeks to reassess his symptoms, monitor for any changes in lung function, and evaluate the effectiveness of his treatment regimen. It is essential that he adheres to his medication schedule and attends all scheduled appointments.

**Additional Notes:**

* The patient's family members will be educated on recognizing signs of respiratory distress and seeking immediate medical attention if they occur.
* A follow-up chest radiograph will be ordered in 2 weeks to assess for any changes in the size or location of the pleural effusion.
