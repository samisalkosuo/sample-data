Visit Summary:

Date: 23.01.2024
Location: Hämeenkyrö Clinic

Patient Information:
Male, 52 years old

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with complaints of progressive difficulty breathing over the past few days, which worsened during exertion.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient reported a gradual increase in shortness of breath, particularly during physical activity. He described feeling winded even when performing light tasks, such as walking or gardening. The symptoms began approximately 2 weeks ago and have progressively worsened. The patient also reported experiencing mild chest discomfort, which is relieved by sitting upright.

Physical Examination Findings:
Given the severity level of 1, indicating an immediate life-threatening situation, the physical examination was focused on assessing the patient's respiratory status. Vital signs revealed a heart rate of 110 bpm, blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 92% on room air. The patient's lungs were clear to auscultation, but there was a notable decrease in breath sounds bilaterally. The patient's skin was pale, and he exhibited signs of mild respiratory distress.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with possible pneumonia is suspected. Further diagnostic testing, including a chest X-ray and possibly a CT scan, may be necessary to confirm the presence of pneumonia.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient was started on oxygen therapy via nasal cannula at 4 liters per minute, as well as a medication regimen consisting of albuterol inhaler (2 puffs every 4-6 hours) and prednisone (40 mg daily for 5 days). The patient will also receive antibiotics (amoxicillin-clavulanate) if pneumonia is confirmed. Close monitoring of the patient's oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, and vital signs will be necessary.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient will be scheduled for a follow-up appointment in 2 weeks to reassess his condition and adjust treatment as needed. The patient is advised to continue using his inhaler as prescribed and to report any worsening symptoms immediately.
