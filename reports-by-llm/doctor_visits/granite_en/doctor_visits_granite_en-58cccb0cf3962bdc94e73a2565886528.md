Patient Age: 45

Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with a persistent cough, shortness of breath, and intermittent chest pain for the past two weeks. He reports increased symptoms over the last 48 hours.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 45-year-old male, reports a gradual onset of a persistent dry cough, dyspnea on exertion, and intermittent sharp chest pain, worsening with deep breaths or coughing. He denies fever, chills, or night sweats but mentions occasional mild hemoptysis (coughing up small amounts of blood). The symptoms have progressed over the past two weeks, with a significant increase in severity and frequency over the last 48 hours.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears anxious but is cooperative. Vital signs are as follows: Temperature - 98.6°F (37°C), Blood Pressure - 140/90 mmHg, Heart Rate - 95 bpm, Respiratory Rate - 20 breaths/min, and Oxygen Saturation - 92% on room air. Auscultation reveals bilateral basal crackles and decreased breath sounds in the right lower lobe. No wheezing is appreciated. Cardiovascular examination shows regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. There are no peripheral edema or clubbing noted.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's age, recent symptom onset, and presentation of a persistent cough, dyspnea, chest pain, and occasional hemoptysis, a working diagnosis of pneumonia (likely right lower lobe) is made. Further investigations, including a chest X-ray and possible sputum culture, are recommended to confirm the diagnosis and identify any causative organisms.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be started on a course of oral antibiotics (Amoxicillin-Clavulanate 875mg/125mg PO q12h for 7 days) to treat suspected bacterial pneumonia. He will also receive inhaled Albuterol as needed for dyspnea and will be advised to increase fluid intake. A follow-up chest X-ray is recommended in one week to assess treatment response.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient should return for a follow-up appointment in one week for reassessment of symptoms, review of the chest X-ray results, and possible adjustment of treatment if necessary. He should contact the clinic immediately if his condition worsens or if he develops new symptoms such as high fever, increasing dyspnea, or calf swelling.
