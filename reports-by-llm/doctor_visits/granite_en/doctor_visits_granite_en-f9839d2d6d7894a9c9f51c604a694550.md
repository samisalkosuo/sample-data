Clinic or Hospital Location: Harjavalta
Severity Level: 2 (Emergent â€“ potential life threat)
Patient Gender: Female
Patient Age: 97

Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient, a 97-year-old female, presents with acute onset confusion and disorientation, reported by her caregiver. She has also experienced a sudden decline in oral intake and increased lethargy over the past 48 hours.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient's caregiver reports that she has been progressively more confused since yesterday, with difficulty following simple commands and orienting to person, place, and time. She has also shown a significant decrease in her usual daily intake, consuming only small amounts of liquids. The patient's lethargy has increased, with minimal verbalization and reduced movement. There is no history of recent falls, head trauma, or fever.

Physical Examination Findings: On examination, the patient appears alert but confused, with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 12 (Eye opening: 4, Verbal response: 3, Motor response: 5). Vital signs are within normal limits for age. Cardiovascular and respiratory examinations reveal no acute distress. Abdominal examination is unremarkable, with no tenderness or organomegaly. Neurological examination shows no focal deficits.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's age, acute onset confusion, decreased oral intake, and lethargy, a differential diagnosis of delirium, urinary tract infection (UTI), or sepsis is considered. Further investigations are required to differentiate between these possibilities.

Plan / Treatment:
1. Complete blood count (CBC) with differential, comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), urinalysis, and urine culture to rule out infection.
2. Non-contrast head computed tomography (CT) scan to assess for intracranial pathology.
3. Intravenous hydration and electrolyte monitoring due to decreased oral intake.
4. Consultation with the geriatric team for further management and supportive care.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the facility for at least 24 hours, with daily assessments of her mental status and vital signs. Results of investigations will guide further management. A follow-up appointment will be scheduled once the patient's condition stabilizes, depending on the underlying cause identified. The caregiver is advised to report any changes in the patient's condition promptly.
