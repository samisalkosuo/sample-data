Visit Date: 20.01.2024  
Clinic or Hospital Location: Kangasala  

Patient Gender: Male  
Patient Age: 11 years old  

Severity Level: 5 (Non-urgent – minor complaints)

Chief Complaint: The patient, an 11-year-old male, presents with a 3-day history of intermittent abdominal pain and mild fever. He reports the discomfort as a dull ache in the lower right quadrant, exacerbated by movement and relieved with rest. The patient also mentions occasional nausea but no vomiting or diarrhea.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The symptoms began 3 days ago, starting with mild abdominal discomfort that gradually increased in intensity. The patient denies any recent trauma, changes in diet, or new medications. He reports no significant past medical history and is up-to-date on his immunizations.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears well-groomed and in no acute distress. Vital signs are within normal limits. Abdominal examination reveals mild tenderness in the right lower quadrant with no rebound or guarding. Bowel sounds are present and normal. No costovertebral angle tenderness is noted.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Based on the patient's history, physical examination, and absence of alarm features (fever >38°C, rebound tenderness, guarding, or rigidity), the most likely diagnosis is acute appendicitis with localized periumbilical pain, a variant presentation.

Plan / Treatment: Given the non-urgent nature and atypical presentation, the patient will be managed conservatively with analgesia (acetaminophen 15mg/kg every 6 hours as needed) and close follow-up. Abdominal ultrasound has been arranged to further evaluate the appendix. The family is advised to return if symptoms worsen or change in nature.

Follow-up Instructions: Please have the patient return to the clinic in 7 days for a follow-up appointment, or sooner if symptoms worsen or change. Instruct the family to monitor the child's temperature and abdominal pain, and report any concerning signs (fever >38°C, increased pain, or inability to tolerate oral intake).
