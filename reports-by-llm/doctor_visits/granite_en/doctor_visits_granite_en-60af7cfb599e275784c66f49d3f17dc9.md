Clinic or Hospital Location: Savukoski  

Patient Gender: Male  
Patient Age: 79  

Severity Level: 5 (Non-urgent â€“ minor complaints)

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with a persistent cough and mild shortness of breath for the past two weeks. He also reports occasional wheezing and increased sputum production, particularly in the morning.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The 79-year-old male patient has been experiencing a gradual onset of symptoms over the past fortnight. He describes his cough as dry initially but now produces thin, clear sputum. Shortness of breath is noticed during moderate exertion and resolves with rest. There is no recent travel history, sick contacts, or known allergies. He denies any chest pain, fever, or hemoptysis. His past medical history is significant for well-controlled hypertension and mild chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears in no acute distress. Vital signs are within normal limits. Lung auscultation reveals bilateral wheezing more prominent in the lower lobes. A few scattered rhonchi are heard throughout the lung fields. Cardiovascular and abdominal examinations are unremarkable. Neurological examination is also normal.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Based on the patient's history, physical examination findings, and considering his age and medical background, a diagnosis of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is made. The symptoms are consistent with increased airway inflammation and mild bronchospasm.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be started on a short course of oral prednisolone 20mg daily for five days to help reduce airway inflammation. In addition, a bronchodilator inhaler (salbutamol/albuterol) will be prescribed for symptomatic relief as needed. He is advised to continue his regular maintenance medications for hypertension and COPD as previously prescribed. A follow-up appointment is scheduled in two weeks for reassessment.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient should return for a follow-up visit in two weeks to evaluate symptom improvement and adjust treatment if necessary. He is advised to monitor his symptoms at home and contact the clinic if they worsen or if he experiences new symptoms such as increased shortness of breath, purulent sputum, or fever. Additionally, he should continue practicing good respiratory hygiene, including handwashing and covering his mouth during coughs to minimize transmission risks.
