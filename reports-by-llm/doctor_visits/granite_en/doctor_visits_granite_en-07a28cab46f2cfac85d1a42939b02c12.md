Patient: Male, 90 years old
Severity Level: 1 (Emergent – potential life threat)

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with sudden onset of severe chest pain, shortness of breath, and diaphoresis.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient reports experiencing a sharp, crushing substernal chest pain radiating to the left arm, which began approximately 30 minutes prior to arrival. The pain is described as 10/10 in severity and unrelenting. Associated symptoms include diaphoresis, nausea, and mild dizziness. The patient has no known history of coronary artery disease but reports a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears distressed, diaphoretic, and in moderate respiratory distress. Vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 180/90 mmHg, heart rate 110 bpm, respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation 88% on room air, and temperature 98.6°F. Cardiovascular exam reveals a regular but tachycardic rhythm with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Lungs are bilaterally diminished with prolonged expiration and wheezing heard at the lung bases. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended with no organomegaly noted. Extremities show mild 2+ edema in the lower extremities. Neurological exam is grossly intact.

Assessment / Diagnosis: The patient's presentation is highly suggestive of an acute coronary syndrome, likely an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Given the severity and potential life threat, immediate cardiac catheterization is warranted to confirm diagnosis and guide intervention.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be immediately transferred to a nearby cardiac catheterization laboratory for emergent diagnostic and interventional procedures. Pre-procedure medications include aspirin 325 mg, clopidogrel 600 mg, and unfractionated heparin according to institutional protocols. Ongoing monitoring and supportive care will be provided during transport.

Follow-up Instructions: Following successful intervention, the patient will be admitted to the cardiac care unit for further management and monitoring. A follow-up appointment with a cardiologist will be scheduled prior to discharge for ongoing management and secondary prevention strategies. The patient's primary care provider will be notified of this admission and the plan for ongoing care.
