Clinic or Hospital Location: Laihia  

Patient Gender: Male  
Patient Age: 68  

Severity Level: 3 (Urgent â€“ stable, needs 2+ resources)

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with progressive dyspnea and a productive cough for the past three days. He reports increased shortness of breath at rest and orthopnea, which has led to sleep disturbances.

History of Present Illness (HPI):  
The 68-year-old male patient reports the onset of his symptoms approximately three days ago with a gradual worsening of dyspnea on exertion. He describes a dry, hacking cough initially, which has since become productive, yielding yellowish sputum. The patient mentions experiencing intermittent chest tightness and occasional wheezing. He denies any recent travel, sick contacts, or known allergies. His past medical history is significant for well-controlled hypertension and mild asthma managed with an inhaler as needed. He is a lifelong non-smoker.

Physical Examination Findings:  
Vital signs: Blood pressure 140/90 mmHg, heart rate 105 bpm, respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation 88% on room air.  
General appearance: The patient appears anxious and in moderate distress.  
HEENT: Normocephalic, atraumatic. Pupils equal, round, and reactive to light. Oropharynx clear.  
Cardiovascular: Regular rhythm, rapid rate. Murmur heard best at the apex, radiating to the axilla. S3 gallop noted.  
Lungs: Decreased breath sounds bilaterally with bibasilar crackles.  
Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, no organomegaly.  
Extremities: No edema.  

Assessment / Diagnosis:  
The patient's presentation is consistent with acute exacerbation of chronic heart failure (CHF), likely precipitated by a respiratory infection. The presence of jugular venous distention, tachypnea, orthopnea, and crackles support this diagnosis.

Plan / Treatment:  
1. Administer supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula to maintain oxygen saturation above 90%.  
2. Initiate intravenous furosemide 40mg for diuresis and symptom relief.  
3. Prescribe oral loop diuretic (bumetanide) for home management of fluid overload.  
4. Start empiric antibiotics (cephalexin 500mg IV q12h) pending culture results for suspected pneumonia.  
5. Arrange for chest X-ray to assess cardiothoracic ratio and rule out pneumonia.  
6. Consult with a cardiologist for further management of CHF exacerbation.  

Follow-up Instructions:  
The patient should return for a follow-up appointment in one week or sooner if symptoms worsen. He will also need to schedule a cardiology consultation as recommended. In the interim, he must adhere to diuretic therapy and continue monitoring his weight daily. He should contact the clinic immediately if he experiences worsening dyspnea, increased orthopnea, or any new or severe symptoms.
