Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with a two-day history of progressive shortness of breath, chest pain, and intermittent coughing. He reports feeling increasingly fatigued and anxious.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient is a 26-year-old male who started experiencing symptoms approximately 48 hours ago. Initially, he noticed mild dyspnea with exertion, which has since worsened to the point where he feels breathless at rest. He describes the chest pain as sharp and intermittent, exacerbated by deep inspiration or coughing. The patient denies any fever, chills, or night sweats but mentions occasional mild hemoptysis (coughing up small amounts of blood). He has no significant past medical history and is not currently on any medications.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears anxious and in moderate distress. His vital signs are as follows: temperature 98.6°F (37°C), heart rate 110 bpm, respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute, blood pressure 130/85 mmHg, and oxygen saturation 92% on room air. Auscultation reveals bilateral basal crackles and decreased breath sounds. There is no wheezing or prolonged expiration. Cardiovascular examination shows tachycardia with regular rhythm and no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. The abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended. Extremities show no edema. Neurological examination is unremarkable.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's age, recent onset of symptoms, and physical examination findings, a working diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) with possible pleural effusion is considered. Further investigations are warranted to confirm this suspicion.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be started on intravenous antibiotics (Ceftriaxone and Azithromycin) and corticosteroids (Methylprednisolone). Oxygen therapy will be initiated to maintain oxygen saturation above 92%. A chest X-ray and blood tests, including complete blood count, inflammatory markers, and blood cultures, will be ordered. If the patient's condition does not improve or worsens, consideration will be given for more advanced diagnostic workup (e.g., CT scan) and potential pleural fluid drainage.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient should return for a follow-up appointment in one week to assess response to treatment and re-evaluate symptoms. If there is no improvement or if symptoms worsen before this scheduled appointment, he should seek immediate medical attention.
