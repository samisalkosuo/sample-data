Clinic or Hospital Location: Puumala  

Patient Gender: Male  
Patient Age: 22  

Severity Level: 3 (Urgent – stable, needs 2+ resources)

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with a two-day history of progressive left-sided abdominal pain, associated with nausea and vomiting. He reports no fever, chills, or diarrhea.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient is a 22-year-old male who started experiencing intermittent, sharp left upper quadrant abdominal pain two days ago. The pain has become constant and now rates it as an 8/10 in severity. He describes the discomfort as cramping and radiating to his back. Accompanying symptoms include non-bloody emesis and a decreased appetite. He denies any urinary symptoms, chest pain, or shortness of breath.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears well-groomed but visibly uncomfortable. Vital signs are within normal limits (blood pressure 124/78 mmHg, heart rate 80 bpm, respiratory rate 16 breaths/min, temperature 36.9°C, and oxygen saturation 99% on room air). Abdominal examination reveals tenderness in the left upper quadrant with guarding but no rebound or rigidity. Bowel sounds are present and normal. No costovertebral angle tenderness is noted.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's age, presentation, and physical findings, a possible diagnosis of acute cholecystitis is considered. This assessment is based on the presence of severe left upper quadrant abdominal pain, guarding, and a history suggestive of biliary colic. Further investigations are warranted to confirm this suspicion.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be admitted for further management and investigation. Initial treatment includes intravenous fluids, analgesia (intravenous diclofenac 75 mg), and antiemetics (intravenous ondansetron 4 mg). Laboratory tests including complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, liver function tests, and amylase will be ordered. An abdominal ultrasound and possible CT scan will be arranged to evaluate the gallbladder and rule out complications such as cholangitis or perforation.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be monitored closely in the hospital setting. Depending on the investigations' results, he may require intervention (e.g., cholecystectomy) or further observation before discharge. A follow-up appointment will be scheduled once stable and discharged for review of test results and discussion of long-term management options. The patient should contact emergency services immediately if his condition worsens, particularly if he develops fever, increased abdominal pain, jaundice, or signs of peritonitis.
