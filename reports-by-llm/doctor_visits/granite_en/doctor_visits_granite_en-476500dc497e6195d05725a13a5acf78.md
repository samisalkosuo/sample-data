Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with progressive dyspnea and a productive cough for the past three days. She reports increased shortness of breath at rest and mild chest pain.

History of Present Illness (HPI): A 79-year-old female reports the onset of her symptoms approximately three days ago. Initially, she experienced a mild cough and intermittent chest discomfort. Over the past two days, her symptoms have worsened, with increased frequency of coughing spells producing yellowish sputum, and progressive dyspnea at rest. She denies fever, chills, or hemoptysis. Her recent medical history is significant for well-controlled hypertension and osteoarthritis. She lives alone and uses a walker for mobility due to her arthritis.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears mildly distressed but in no immediate respiratory distress. Vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 130/80 mmHg, heart rate 92 bpm, respirations 20/min, temperature 98.6°F (37°C), and oxygen saturation 94% on room air. Lung auscultation reveals bilateral basal crackles. Cardiovascular examination shows regular rhythm with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and bowel sounds are present. Extremities show mild peripheral edema up to the knees. Neurological examination is unremarkable.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's age, progressive dyspnea, productive cough with yellow sputum, and bilateral basal crackles on lung auscultation, a working diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is made. Further investigations, including chest X-ray and blood tests, are recommended to confirm the diagnosis and assess for any complications.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be started on intravenous ceftriaxone 500mg once daily and azithromycin 500mg once daily for community-acquired pneumonia, as per current guidelines. She will also receive supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula to maintain oxygen saturation above 92%. Diuretics (e.g., furosemide) may be considered if peripheral edema worsens or becomes symptomatic. The patient will undergo a chest X-ray and complete blood count, including inflammatory markers. She will also receive instructions on home oxygen therapy if needed post-discharge.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient should return for a follow-up appointment in one week to assess her response to treatment and review any investigational results. If symptoms worsen or do not improve, she should seek immediate medical attention. She will also be provided with information on recognizing signs of pneumonia deterioration and when to seek emergency care.
