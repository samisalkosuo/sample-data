Clinic or Hospital Location: Alaj√§rvi  

Patient Information:  
Gender: Female  
Age: 91 years old  

Severity Level: 4 (Less-urgent)

Chief Complaint:  
The patient presents with a chief complaint of progressive shortness of breath and mild lower extremity edema, which has been gradually worsening over the past two weeks.

History of Present Illness (HPI):  
The 91-year-old female reports experiencing increasing dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea for approximately two weeks. She also mentions mild swelling in her lower extremities, particularly noticeable in the ankles. There is no recent history of chest pain, cough, fever, or weight changes. Her past medical history is significant for hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She takes warfarin, lisinopril, and salmeterol as prescribed.

Physical Examination Findings:  
Vital signs: Blood pressure 130/80 mmHg, heart rate 92 bpm, respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation 90% on room air.  
General appearance: The patient appears her stated age and is in moderate distress due to dyspnea.  
HEENT: Normocephalic, atraumatic. Pupils equal, round, and reactive to light. Oropharynx clear.  
Cardiovascular: Regular rhythm, rate 92 bpm, mildly irregular. S1 and S2 audible. No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  
Lungs: Decreased breath sounds in the bases with prolonged expiration. Coarse crackles heard at the lung bases.  
Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, non-distended.  
Extremities: Mild pitting edema noted in both lower extremities, more prominent on the right side.  
Neurological: Alert and oriented to person, place, and time.

Assessment / Diagnosis:  
The patient's symptoms of progressive dyspnea, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and lower extremity edema, along with her history of COPD, atrial fibrillation, and hypertension, suggest possible worsening of heart failure. Given the physical examination findings, including crackles in the lung bases and mild lower extremity edema, a probable diagnosis of acute exacerbation of chronic heart failure is made.

Plan / Treatment:  
1. Order lab tests: Complete blood count (CBC), comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), and troponin levels to assess cardiac function and rule out other causes of dyspnea.
2. Initiate treatment with intravenous furosemide 40 mg for diuresis, and consider adding additional medications based on lab results and clinical response.
3. Adjust antihypertensive therapy (lisinopril) as needed to optimize blood pressure control without compromising cardiac function.
4. Consult with a cardiologist for further management of heart failure exacerbation, including potential adjustment of warfarin dosing and consideration of device-based therapies if appropriate.
5. Provide patient education on the importance of medication adherence, lifestyle modifications (e.g., fluid restriction, sodium control), and recognizing signs of worsening heart failure.

Follow-up Instructions:  
Schedule a follow-up appointment with the cardiologist within one week to reassess the patient's condition and adjust treatment as necessary. Instruct the patient to return immediately if symptoms worsen or if she experiences new or severe chest pain, increased shortness of breath, or sudden weight gain.
