Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with a 3-day history of progressive shortness of breath and chest pain. He reports feeling increasingly fatigued and experiencing mild fever.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 43-year-old male, reports the onset of symptoms three days ago. He describes a gradual worsening of dyspnea, particularly with exertion, and a constant, dull, non-radiating chest pain rated as 7/10 in severity. The patient also mentions intermittent coughing and mild fever up to 38°C. He denies any recent trauma, travel, or sick contacts. His past medical history is significant for well-controlled hypertension and a 20-pack-year smoking history that ceased 5 years ago.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears mildly distressed but is in stable condition. Vital signs are as follows: Blood pressure 140/90 mmHg, heart rate 92 bpm, respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation 92% on room air, and temperature 37.8°C. Auscultation reveals bilateral basal crackles and decreased breath sounds in the lower lung fields. Cardiovascular examination shows regular rhythm with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. There is no peripheral edema noted.

Assessment / Diagnosis: The patient's presentation is concerning for a possible acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or an alternative diagnosis such as pneumonia or heart failure. Further investigations are warranted to differentiate these possibilities.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will undergo a chest X-ray and complete blood count (CBC), electrolytes, and basic metabolic panel (BMP). He will be started on a short-acting bronchodilator inhaler (albuterol) as needed for dyspnea. Intravenous fluids and supplemental oxygen will be administered to maintain adequate hydration and oxygenation. The patient is advised against smoking cessation support resources available at our clinic.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient should return for a follow-up appointment in 48 hours or sooner if symptoms worsen. He will be contacted with the results of his investigations and further management plans will be discussed at that time.
