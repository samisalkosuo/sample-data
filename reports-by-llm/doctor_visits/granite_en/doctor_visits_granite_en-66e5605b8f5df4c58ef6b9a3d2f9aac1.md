Clinic or Hospital Location: Hanko  

Patient Gender: Female  
Patient Age: 67  

Severity Level: 4 (Less-urgent – stable, stable, 1 resource)

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with a persistent cough and progressive shortness of breath for the past two weeks. She also reports intermittent chest pain and occasional wheezing.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 67-year-old female, reports the onset of her symptoms approximately two weeks ago. Initially, she experienced a dry cough and mild fatigue, which have since progressed to include productive sputum, shortness of breath at rest, and intermittent chest pain described as sharp and worsening with deep inspiration. She also reports occasional wheezing, particularly during physical exertion. The patient denies any recent travel, sick contacts, or known allergies. Her past medical history is significant for well-controlled hypertension and osteoarthritis. She is a non-smoker and has no history of pulmonary diseases.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears her stated age and is in moderate distress due to shortness of breath. Vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 138/82 mmHg, heart rate 96 bpm, respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation 90% on room air, and temperature 98.6°F. Auscultation reveals bilateral basal crackles and decreased breast sounds. Cardiovascular examination shows regular rhythm with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Lungs are diffusely diminished to auscultation with occasional wheezing. There is no peripheral edema noted.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Based on the patient's history and physical examination findings, she is likely experiencing an exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient's symptoms of persistent cough, progressive shortness of breath, chest pain, and wheezing, along with the physical examination findings of decreased breath sounds, bilateral basal crackles, and occasional wheezing, support this diagnosis.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be initiated on a short course of high-dose oral corticosteroids (prednisolone 40 mg daily) along with a bronchodilator inhaler (salbutamol as needed). She will also receive a prescription for a long-acting bronchodilator (tiotropium) to be used daily. The patient will be advised to follow up in one week or sooner if symptoms worsen. Additionally, she will be referred to a pulmonologist for further evaluation and management of her COPD.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient is scheduled to return in one week for a follow-up appointment to assess response to treatment and adjust the management plan as needed. In the meantime, she should monitor her symptoms closely and seek immediate medical attention if her condition worsens or if she experiences new or severe symptoms such as chest tightness, increased shortness of breath, or changes in sputum color or volume.
