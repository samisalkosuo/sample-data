Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with a persistent, non-healing ulcer on the right heel, accompanied by mild intermittent pain and occasional swelling.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The 65-year-old male reports that the ulcer developed approximately two months ago following an injury from a fall at home. He has noticed no significant improvement despite maintaining good hygiene and using over-the-counter antiseptic creams. The pain is described as a dull ache, worsening with prolonged standing or walking, and relieved by rest. Swelling is infrequent but noticeable when the patient stands for extended periods. He denies any systemic symptoms such as fever, chills, or night sweats.

Physical Examination Findings: On examination, a well-demarcated, shallow ulcer measuring approximately 1 cm in diameter is observed on the right heel. The edges are slightly indurated with a granulating base and minimal exudate. There is mild erythema surrounding the ulcer. No signs of infection or cellulitis are noted. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, and there is no evidence of peripheral edema.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Based on the clinical presentation and physical examination findings, the patient is diagnosed with a non-healing venous ulcer, likely secondary to chronic venous insufficiency.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be prescribed a topical antibiotic ointment (Mupirocin 2%) for the ulcer and advised to use compression stockings (30-40 mmHg) to improve venous return. He will also be referred to a vascular specialist for further evaluation and possible interventional procedures if necessary. The patient is educated on the importance of wound care, including keeping the area clean and dry, changing dressings regularly, and avoiding prolonged standing or walking.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient is scheduled for a follow-up appointment in four weeks to assess healing progress. He is advised to contact the clinic immediately if there are any signs of worsening symptoms, such as increased pain, swelling, redness, or discharge from the ulcer.
