Severity Level: 1
Patient Gender: Male
Patient Age: 60

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with sudden onset of severe chest pain, shortness of breath, and diaphoresis.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 60-year-old male, reports experiencing sudden onset of severe substernal chest pain radiating to the left arm, accompanied by shortness of breath and diaphoresis approximately 30 minutes prior to arrival. He denies any history of similar episodes but has a known history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia.

Physical Examination Findings: The patient appears anxious and in distress. His vital signs reveal a blood pressure of 160/90 mmHg, heart rate of 110 bpm, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 88% on room air, and temperature of 37°C. Auscultation of lung sounds reveals bilateral wheezing. Cardiovascular examination demonstrates irregular heart rhythm with a rate of 110 bpm, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Extremities show no edema, but peripheral pulses are weakly palpable.

Assessment / Diagnosis: The patient's presentation is highly suggestive of an acute coronary syndrome, likely an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Given the severity and nature of symptoms, immediate cardiac catheterization is warranted to confirm diagnosis and guide potential intervention.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be immediately transferred to a nearby cardiac catheterization laboratory for emergent diagnostic testing and possible percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). He will receive aspirin 325 mg, nitroglycerin 0.4 mg sublingually every 5 minutes as needed, and morphine 2 mg intravenously for pain control during transport. Oxygen will be administered via non-rebreather mask during transit.

Follow-up Instructions: Following the intervention, the patient will be closely monitored in a coronary care unit (CCU) for at least 48 hours. Subsequent follow-up will be arranged with a cardiologist upon discharge from the hospital. The patient should adhere to prescribed medications, including dual antiplatelet therapy and statin, as well as lifestyle modifications to reduce cardiovascular risk.
