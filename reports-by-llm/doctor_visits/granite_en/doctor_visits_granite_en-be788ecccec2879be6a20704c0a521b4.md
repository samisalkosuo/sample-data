Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient, a 77-year-old female, presents with a chief complaint of persistent, non-radiating lower back pain and difficulty walking for the past two weeks.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient reports gradual onset of moderate, dull aching pain in the lower back, exacerbated by prolonged standing or walking short distances. She denies any recent trauma, fever, or chills. The symptoms have progressively worsened, leading to limited mobility and difficulty performing daily activities.

Physical Examination Findings: On examination, the patient appears to be in mild distress due to pain. Her vital signs are within normal limits. Tenderness is noted in the lumbar region with palpation, and straight leg raise test is negative. Range of motion reveals reduced flexion and lateral bending due to discomfort. Neurological examination is unremarkable.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Based on the patient's history and physical examination findings, a likely diagnosis of lumbar spinal stenosis with associated mechanical low back pain is made.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be prescribed a short course of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for pain management and inflammation reduction. She will also benefit from physical therapy focusing on core strengthening exercises and posture improvement. A referral to a physiatrist for further evaluation and possible interventional procedures, such as epidural steroid injections, is recommended.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient should follow up in two weeks for reassessment of symptoms and treatment response. If there is no significant improvement or if symptoms worsen, she should return for further evaluation. In the meantime, she is advised to maintain a regular exercise routine, practice good posture, and avoid prolonged standing or activities that exacerbate her pain.
