Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with acute onset of severe abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 55-year-old female, reports experiencing sudden onset of severe epigastric pain radiating to the back, accompanied by non-bloody emesis and anorexia. The symptoms began approximately six hours ago and have been progressively worsening. She denies any fever, chills, or diarrhea. Her past medical history is significant for well-controlled hypertension and no known allergies.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears distressed due to pain. Vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 140/90 mmHg, heart rate 102 bpm, respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and temperature 37°C. Abdominal examination reveals guarding, rebound tenderness, and mild distension. Bowel sounds are hyperactive but present. There is no rebound or rigidity. The rest of the physical examination is unremarkable.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's presentation, a working diagnosis of acute cholecystitis is considered. This assessment is based on the sudden onset of severe right upper quadrant abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and positive Murphy's sign (pain on deep inspiration during palpation).

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be admitted for further management. Initial workup includes laboratory tests (complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, lipase), abdominal ultrasound, and possible CT scan if necessary. She will receive intravenous fluids, pain management with opioids and NSAIDs, and antiemetics as needed. Surgical consultation for potential cholecystectomy is warranted.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be followed up in the hospital setting as an inpatient. Once stable, she will be transferred to a surgical service for definitive management. Postoperative follow-up will be scheduled before discharge. The patient should contact her primary care provider within 72 hours of discharge for further management and monitoring.
