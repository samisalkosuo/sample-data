Clinic or Hospital Location: Isojoki  

Patient Gender: Female  
Patient Age: 62  

Severity Level: 5 (Non-urgent â€“ minor complaints)

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with a persistent cough and mild shortness of breath for the past two weeks. She also reports occasional wheezing, especially at night.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient is a 62-year-old female who has been experiencing a gradual onset of a dry cough and mild dyspnea over the past fortnight. She denies any recent travel, sick contacts, or known allergies. She reports no significant past medical history but mentions occasional seasonal allergies. The symptoms are worse at night and improve with sitting upright. She has not taken any medications for this condition.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears well-groomed and in no acute distress. Vital signs are within normal limits. Auscultation of the lungs reveals bilateral wheezing, more prominent in the lower lobes. The rest of the physical exam is unremarkable.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Based on the patient's history and physical examination findings, she is likely suffering from a mild exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), possibly triggered by seasonal allergies.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be prescribed a short course of a bronchodilator inhaler (e.g., albuterol) to manage symptoms. She will also receive instructions on using a spacer device for better inhaler technique. Additionally, she is advised to avoid known allergens and consider using an air purifier in her home. A follow-up appointment is scheduled in four weeks for reassessment.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient should return in four weeks for a follow-up visit to assess symptom improvement and adjust treatment if necessary. She is advised to contact the clinic immediately if her symptoms worsen or if she experiences increased shortness of breath, chest tightness, or changes in sputum color or volume.
