Severity Level: 4
Patient Gender: Female
Patient Age: 94

Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient, a 94-year-old female, presents with progressive dyspnea and generalized fatigue over the past two weeks. She reports a dry cough and intermittent chest pain, exacerbated by minimal exertion.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient's symptoms began approximately two weeks ago, initially presenting as mild shortness of breath with exertion. Over the past week, her condition has worsened, with dyspnea at rest and persistent fatigue. She denies any recent weight loss, fever, or night sweats. Her past medical history is significant for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and mild cardiovascular disease.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears comfortable but visibly labored during conversation. Vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 130/80 mmHg, heart rate 95 bpm, respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation 88% on room air, and temperature 98.6째F. Auscultation reveals bilateral basal crackles and decreased breath sounds. Cardiovascular examination shows regular rhythm with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. There is no peripheral edema noted.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's age, history of COPD, and current symptoms of progressive dyspnea, generalized fatigue, and hypoxemia, a likely diagnosis is acute exacerbation of COPD (AEC).

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be initiated on systemic corticosteroids (prednisolone 20mg daily) and antibiotics (azithromycin 500mg once daily) for AEC. She will also receive supplemental oxygen therapy via nasal cannula to maintain oxygen saturation above 90%. Further diagnostic workup, including chest X-ray and blood tests (complete blood count, electrolytes, renal function), will be arranged.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient is scheduled for a follow-up appointment in one week for reassessment of symptoms and response to treatment. She should contact the clinic immediately if her condition worsens or she experiences new symptoms.
