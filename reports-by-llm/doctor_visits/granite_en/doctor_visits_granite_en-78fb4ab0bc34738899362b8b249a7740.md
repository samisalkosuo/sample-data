Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient, a 91-year-old male, presents with acute onset of severe chest pain and shortness of breath.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient reports experiencing sudden, crushing substernal chest pain radiating to the left arm, accompanied by diaphoresis and nausea, which began approximately 30 minutes prior to arrival. He has a history of hypertension and angioplasty two years ago. The symptoms are progressively worsening, prompting immediate medical attention.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears distressed, diaphoretic, and in moderate respiratory distress. Blood pressure is 180/90 mmHg, heart rate is 110 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation is 88% on room air. Auscultation reveals decreased breath sounds and a faint third heart sound. ECG shows ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, and aVF, suggestive of an acute inferior myocardial infarction.

Assessment / Diagnosis: The patient is diagnosed with an acute inferior myocardial infarction (STEMI) based on the presented symptoms and ECG findings.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be immediately transferred to a nearby cardiac catheterization lab for emergent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Pre-procedure medications include aspirin, clopidogrel, and heparin. Intravenous nitroglycerin and morphine will be administered for symptom relief.

Follow-up Instructions: Following successful PCI, the patient will be monitored in the coronary care unit (CCU) for at least 48 hours. Subsequent follow-up will be arranged with a cardiologist to discuss long-term management, including dual antiplatelet therapy and potential revascularization options. The patient's primary care provider will also be notified of the procedure and findings.
