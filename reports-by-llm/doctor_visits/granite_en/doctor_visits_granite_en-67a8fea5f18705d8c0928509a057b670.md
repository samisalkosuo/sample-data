Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient, a 7-year-old female, presents with her mother due to a persistent high fever and difficulty breathing for the past three days.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient has been experiencing a high fever, up to 40°C (104°F), with intermittent shaking chills. She also reports increased respiratory effort, particularly during feeding and play, and occasional nasal flaring. The symptoms began three days ago and have not improved despite over-the-counter fever reducers. There is no known recent exposure to other sick individuals or recent travel.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears alert but visibly uncomfortable. Her temperature is 40°C (104°F) rectally, pulse is 120 beats per minute, and respiratory rate is 36 breaths per minute with occasional nasal flaring. Oxygen saturation is 92% on room air. Auscultation of the lungs reveals bilateral wheezing and decreased breast sounds in the lower lobes. Cardiovascular examination is unremarkable, and there are no other notable findings.

Assessment / Diagnosis: The patient's presentation is consistent with a viral upper respiratory tract infection complicated by secondary bacterial pneumonia, likely caused by Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib). This assessment is based on the clinical picture of fever, tachypnea, nasal flaring, and auscultatory findings.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be started on intravenous ceftriaxone for suspected Hib pneumonia and given an oral antipyretic (acetaminophen) to manage fever. She will also receive supplemental oxygen as needed to maintain oxygen saturation above 92%. The mother is advised on proper administration of the prescribed medications and encouraged to monitor the patient's symptoms closely.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient should be reassessed in 48 hours or sooner if fever returns, respiratory distress worsens, or other concerning symptoms develop. The mother is instructed to contact the clinic immediately if these situations arise. Additionally, the patient will receive a Hib vaccination at the next available opportunity to prevent future infections.
