Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with a two-day history of progressive left lower quadrant abdominal pain, associated with nausea and vomiting.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient is a 23-year-old female who reports the onset of sharp, cramping abdominal pain in the left lower quadrant approximately 48 hours ago. The pain has been increasing in intensity and is currently rated as 8/10. She describes it as constant and non-radiating. Accompanying symptoms include bilious vomiting and anorexia. There is no fever, chills, or dysuria. She denies any recent trauma, travel, or changes in bowel habits.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears moderately distressed but is cooperative. Vital signs are within normal limits except for mild tachycardia (105 bpm). Abdominal examination reveals guarding and rebound tenderness in the left lower quadrant with no rebound or percussion tenderness elsewhere. Bowel sounds are hyperactive and borborygmus are audible. No masses or organomegaly are appreciated. Digital rectal examination is contraindicated due to patient discomfort.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Based on the history, physical examination findings, and exclusion of other causes, the patient's presentation is suggestive of acute appendicitis.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be referred for an urgent abdominal CT scan to confirm the diagnosis. If confirmed, she will require emergent appendectomy. She will be started on intravenous fluids and antiemetics for symptom management. Laboratory tests including complete blood count, metabolic panel, and urinalysis are ordered.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient should return to the clinic for follow-up once she has recovered from surgery, typically within 10-14 days. She will need to avoid solid foods until post-operative dietary instructions are provided and may require pain management as needed with prescribed medications.
