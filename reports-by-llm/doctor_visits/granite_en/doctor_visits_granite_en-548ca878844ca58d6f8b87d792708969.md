Patient Gender: Male  
Patient Age: 53  

Severity Level: 2 (Emergent – potential life threat)

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with acute onset of severe chest pain, shortness of breath, and diaphoresis.

History of Present Illness (HPI):  
The patient, a 53-year-old male, reports the sudden onset of severe substernal chest pain approximately 1 hour ago. The pain is described as a crushing sensation, radiating to his left arm, and is currently rated as an 8/10 in severity. He also reports shortness of breath at rest and profuse diaphoresis. There is no known history of coronary artery disease or recent trauma.

Physical Examination Findings:  
Vital signs: Blood pressure 140/90 mmHg, heart rate 110 bpm, respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation 88% on room air, and temperature 37.2°C. The patient appears diaphoretic, pale, and in moderate distress. Cardiovascular exam reveals irregular heart rhythm with a possible murmur. Lungs are bilaterally diminished with prolonged expiration. No lower extremity edema is noted.

Assessment / Diagnosis:  
The patient's presentation is concerning for an acute coronary syndrome, possibly an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Further diagnostic testing, including an electrocardiogram (ECG) and cardiac biomarkers, is indicated.

Plan / Treatment:  
1. Immediate ECG to assess for STEMI.
2. Aspirin 300 mg chewed, followed by 75 mg daily.
3. Sublingual nitroglycerin 0.4 mg, repeated as needed for angina.
4. Oxygen via nasal cannula at 4 L/min to maintain oxygen saturation above 92%.
5. Admission for further management, including potential percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).
6. Consult cardiology for possible primary PCI.

Follow-up Instructions:  
The patient will be admitted for further evaluation and management. The cardiology team will provide updates on the patient's condition and treatment plan. The patient should follow up with his primary care provider within one week post-discharge for ongoing management of any underlying coronary artery disease.
