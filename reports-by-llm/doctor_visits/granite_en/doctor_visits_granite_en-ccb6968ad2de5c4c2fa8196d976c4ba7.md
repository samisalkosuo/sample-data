Severity Level: 3 (Urgent â€“ stable, needs 2+ resources)
Patient Gender: Male
Patient Age: 33

Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with a 3-day history of progressive shortness of breath and chest pain.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 33-year-old male, reports the onset of symptoms three days ago. He describes his chest pain as a sharp, stabbing sensation, worsening with deep inspiration and relieved by sitting upright. He also reports increasing shortness of breath, which has progressed from mild exertional dyspnea to difficulty breathing at rest. He denies any cough, fever, or hemoptysis.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears anxious but is in stable condition. His vital signs are within normal limits except for a respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute. Auscultation reveals bilateral basal crackles and decreased breath sounds. Cardiovascular examination shows tachycardia with a heart rate of 110 bpm and regular rhythm. There is no murmur, gallop, or rub noted. The patient's oxygen saturation on room air is 92%.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's age, presentation of chest pain, shortness of breath, and pulmonary crackles, a working diagnosis of acute exacerbation of asthma or possible pneumonia is considered. Further investigations are required to rule out other differentials such as pneumothorax or pleural effusion.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will receive a course of high-dose inhaled bronchodilators (short-acting beta-agonist and anticholinergic) via a nebulizer treatment. He will also receive a course of oral corticosteroids for suspected exacerbation of asthma. A chest X-ray is recommended to evaluate for pneumonia or other pulmonary pathology. If the patient's condition does not improve, further investigations such as CT scan or possible referral to a pulmonologist may be necessary.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient should return for a follow-up appointment in 48 hours to reassess his symptoms and review the results of the chest X-ray. He will also receive instructions on proper asthma management, including peak flow monitoring and an action plan for future exacerbations. If there is no improvement or if symptoms worsen before the follow-up, he should seek immediate medical attention.
