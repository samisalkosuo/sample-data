Clinic or Hospital Location: Lapua  

Patient Gender: Female  
Patient Age: 48  

Severity Level: 4 (Less-urgent â€“ stable, stable, 1 resource)

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with a persistent cough and progressive shortness of breath for the past three weeks. She also reports intermittent chest pain and occasional wheezing.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 48-year-old female, reports the onset of her symptoms approximately three weeks ago. Initially, she experienced a dry cough that gradually became productive with yellowish sputum. Over the past week, she has noticed increasing shortness of breath, particularly during exertion, and occasional sharp chest pain that worsens with deep inspiration. She denies any recent travel, sick contacts, or known allergies. Her only medication is an over-the-counter multivitamin.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears mildly distressed but is in stable condition. Vital signs are within normal limits. Auscultation reveals decreased breath sounds in the right lower lung lobe with occasional wheezing. Percussion elicits dullness, and percussion note is hyperresonant, suggesting possible pneumothorax or pleural effusion. There is no evidence of jugular venous distention or cyanosis.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Based on the patient's history and physical examination findings, she is suspected to have a right-sided pneumothorax with possible underlying lung pathology, such as emphysema or bullae formation. Further diagnostic testing, including a chest X-ray and possibly CT scan, is recommended to confirm the diagnosis and assess the extent of lung involvement.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be started on a short course of oral corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone 40 mg daily) to help reduce airway inflammation and improve symptoms. She will also receive a prescription for an albuterol inhaler for acute bronchospasm relief. A referral to a pulmonologist is recommended for further evaluation and management.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient should return for follow-up in one week or sooner if symptoms worsen. She must also schedule an urgent chest X-ray at the nearest imaging facility. Additionally, she should avoid strenuous activities until her condition is better controlled.
