05.07.2025 Kuusamo Clinic Visit Report

Chief Complaint: A 99-year-old male patient presents with progressive dyspnea and mild chest pain of one-day duration.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a non-smoker with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and atrial fibrillation, reports worsening shortness of breath over the past 24 hours. He describes mild chest discomfort, primarily in the central region, exacerbated by minimal exertion. There is no history of fever, cough, or hemoptysis.

Physical Examination Findings: The patient appears elderly, alert, and in moderate distress. Vital signs reveal a blood pressure of 140/80 mmHg, heart rate of 95 bpm, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 88% on room air, and temperature of 98.6Â°F. Auscultation of the lungs reveals bilateral wheezing and decreased air entry in the bases. Cardiovascular examination shows irregularly irregular rhythm with a rate of 95 bpm, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. There is no peripheral edema.

Assessment / Diagnosis: The patient's symptoms and history are suggestive of an acute exacerbation of COPD, likely precipitated by atrial fibrillation-related fluid overload.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be initiated on a nebulized bronchodilator treatment (albuterol/ipratropium) and systemic corticosteroids (prednisone 20mg). Intravenous diuresis with furosemide will be administered to manage fluid overload. Continuous cardiac monitoring is recommended.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient should return for a follow-up visit in one week or sooner if symptoms worsen. He will also require ongoing outpatient management by his primary care physician and cardiologist for his chronic conditions.
