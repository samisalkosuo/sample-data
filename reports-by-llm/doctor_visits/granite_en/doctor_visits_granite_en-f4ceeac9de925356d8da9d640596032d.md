Visit Date: 07.10.2024  
Clinic or Hospital Location: Pietarsaari  

Patient Gender: Male  
Patient Age: 62  

Severity Level: 5 (Non-urgent â€“ minor complaints)

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with a persistent cough and mild shortness of breath for the past two weeks. He also reports occasional wheezing, especially during physical exertion.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The 62-year-old male patient has been experiencing a gradual onset of a dry cough, accompanied by mild dyspnea and intermittent wheezing for the past two weeks. He denies any chest pain, fever, or chills. The symptoms seem to worsen with exertion and improve at rest. He has no known history of respiratory diseases but mentions occasional seasonal allergies.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears well-groomed and in moderate distress due to mild dyspnea. Vital signs are within normal limits. Auscultation reveals bilateral wheezing, more prominent at the bases. Lung fields show diminished breath sounds and occasional crackles at the lung bases. Cardiovascular examination is unremarkable with no murmurs or gallops. The abdomen is soft, non-tender, and bowel sounds are present. Extremities show no edema, and peripheral pulses are strong bilaterally.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Based on the patient's history and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is considered most likely. The patient's mild dyspnea, occasional wheezing, and bilateral basal crackles are suggestive of airflow limitation and possible small airway disease or parenchymal involvement.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be prescribed a short-acting bronchodilator (e.g., albuterol) for immediate relief of symptoms. He will also receive a course of a systemic corticosteroid (e.g., prednisone) to reduce airway inflammation. Inhaler technique demonstration and proper usage instructions will be provided. The patient is advised to avoid known triggers, such as smoke and pollutants, and to use a peak flow meter at home for monitoring.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient should return in two weeks for a follow-up visit to assess symptom improvement and adjust treatment if necessary. He will also be scheduled for spirometry testing during this visit to evaluate lung function objectively. If symptoms worsen or do not improve, he is instructed to seek immediate medical attention.
