Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with acute abdominal pain, severe nausea, and vomiting. She reports a sudden onset of symptoms approximately two hours ago.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient is a 27-year-old female who presented to the clinic today complaining of severe, constant, and sharp abdominal pain localized to the right lower quadrant. She describes the pain as a 10/10 in intensity, radiating to her groin area. The patient also reports experiencing frequent, forceful ejections of vomit without any nausea-preceding retching or bile in the vomitus. She denies any fever, chills, or recent trauma to the abdomen. Her menstrual history is unremarkable, and she is not currently pregnant.

Physical Examination Findings: On examination, the patient appears distressed due to pain. Vital signs are as follows: temperature 98.6°F (37°C), blood pressure 120/80 mmHg, heart rate 105 bpm, respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 98% on room air. Abdominal examination reveals guarding, rebound tenderness, and voluntary movement of the right lower quadrant with pain exacerbation. Murphy's sign is positive. Bowel sounds are hyperactive, and there is no rebound or flank tenderness. Digital rectal examination was avoided due to patient discomfort.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the acute onset of severe right lower quadrant abdominal pain, guarding, rebound tenderness, positive Murphy's sign, and hyperactive bowel sounds, the differential diagnosis includes appendicitis, ovarian torsion, or a ruptured ectopic pregnancy. Further investigations are warranted to confirm the diagnosis.

Plan / Treatment: The patient is admitted for further evaluation and management. Initial laboratory tests include a complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, and urinalysis. An abdominopelvic CT scan with contrast is ordered to assess for appendicitis or other intra-abdominal pathology. Intravenous fluids are administered to maintain hydration. Pain management is provided with intravenous morphine as needed. Surgical consultation is requested for potential appendectomy, and the patient is prepared for possible urgent surgery if indicated.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be followed up postoperatively in the surgical clinic for wound care and removal of sutures. She should return to the emergency department immediately if she experiences worsening pain, fever, or any other concerning symptoms before her scheduled follow-up appointment.
