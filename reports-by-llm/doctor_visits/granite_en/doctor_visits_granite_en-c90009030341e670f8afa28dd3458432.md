Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with a persistent cough, shortness of breath, and intermittent chest pain for the past two weeks. He reports increased fatigue and occasional wheezing.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 40-year-old male, reports the onset of symptoms approximately two weeks ago. He describes a persistent dry cough, exacerbated by exertion, and progressive shortness of breath, particularly during physical activities. He also mentions intermittent chest pain, described as sharp and worsening with deep inspiration. The patient reports increased fatigue and occasional wheezing, which he attributes to his usual sedentary lifestyle. He denies fever, night sweats, or weight loss.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears mildly distressed but is in stable condition. Vital signs are within normal limits. Auscultation reveals decreased breath sounds in the right lower lung field and bilateral wheezing. Percussion tenderness is noted over the right lower chest wall. There are no other significant findings on general inspection or systemic examination.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's history, physical examination findings, and the severity level, a working diagnosis of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is made. Further investigations, such as a chest X-ray and spirometry, are recommended to confirm this diagnosis and assess the extent of airflow limitation.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be started on a short course of oral corticosteroids (prednisolone 40mg daily) and bronchodilators (salbutamol inhaler as needed for symptom relief). He will also receive instructions on proper inhaler technique and the importance of adherence to medication. The patient is advised to avoid known triggers, such as smoke and pollutants, and to engage in regular pulmonary rehabilitation.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient should return for a follow-up appointment in two weeks to assess symptom improvement and lung function. If symptoms worsen or do not improve, he is instructed to seek immediate medical attention. Additionally, the patient will be referred for spirometry testing and a chest X-ray at our clinic's earliest convenience.
