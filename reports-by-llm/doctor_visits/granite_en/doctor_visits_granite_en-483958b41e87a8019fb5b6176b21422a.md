Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with a 3-day history of progressive lower abdominal pain, fever, and dysuria. She reports experiencing frequent, painful urination and lower back discomfort.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient is a 26-year-old female who first noticed mild lower abdominal discomfort two days ago, which has since escalated to severe, constant pain. She reports fever up to 38.5°C and increased frequency, urgency, and pain during urination. Additionally, she describes lower back pain radiating to the groin area. She denies any vaginal discharge, vomiting, or diarrhea. Her menstrual cycle is regular, and she is not currently menstruating.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears moderately distressed. Vital signs are within normal limits except for a temperature of 38.2°C. Abdominal examination reveals tenderness in the lower quadrants, with guarding and rebound tenderness. Costovertebral angle tenderness is noted. Digital rectal examination is unremarkable. Urinalysis shows pyuria with a few red blood cells; culture and sensitivity are pending.

Assessment / Diagnosis: The patient's presentation is suggestive of acute pyelonephritis, likely secondary to a lower urinary tract infection (UTI). Given her symptoms, fever, and positive urinalysis findings, this diagnosis is made with a high index of suspicion.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be commenced on intravenous fluids for hydration and prescribed empirical antibiotics (ceftriaxone 500mg and nitrofurantoin 100mg, to be taken orally for a total of seven days) to cover common UTI pathogens. She will also receive nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for pain management. A urine culture and sensitivity will be obtained to guide definitive antibiotic therapy.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient should return for a follow-up appointment in one week to assess symptom resolution, review urine culture results, and adjust treatment if necessary. She is advised to contact the clinic immediately if her condition worsens or if she develops new symptoms such as flank pain, nausea, vomiting, or signs of sepsis.
