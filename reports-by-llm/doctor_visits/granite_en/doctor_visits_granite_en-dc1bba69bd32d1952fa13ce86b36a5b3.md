Clinic or Hospital Location: Alaj√§rvi
Severity Level: 4
Patient Gender: Female
Patient Age: 47

Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with a chief complaint of progressive shortness of breath and chest pain for the past three days. She reports feeling increasingly fatigued and experiencing mild fever.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 47-year-old female, reports the onset of symptoms approximately three days ago. Initially, she experienced intermittent chest discomfort, which has since become constant and associated with shortness of breath at rest and mild exertion. She describes the pain as a dull ache in the center of her chest, worsening with deep breaths or coughing. Additionally, she reports a low-grade fever and generalized fatigue that has limited her daily activities. There is no known history of heart disease, but she has a family history of hypertension.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears mildly distressed, with a respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation of 92% on room air. Her blood pressure is 140/90 mmHg, and her heart rate is 90 beats per minute. Auscultation reveals bilateral basal crackles. Cardiovascular examination shows regular rhythm but a III/VI holosystolic murmur heard best at the apex. There are no peripheral edemas noted.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's age, symptoms of chest pain, shortness of breath, and fever, along with physical examination findings such as tachypnea, decreased oxygen saturation, and a new heart murmur, she is likely experiencing a possible acute exacerbation of her underlying hypertension leading to congestive heart failure (CHF). Further investigations are warranted to rule out other differentials like pneumonia or pulmonary embolism.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be started on intravenous furosemide 20mg for diuresis, lisinopril 5mg daily for antihypertensive management, and oxygen therapy via nasal cannula to maintain saturation above 94%. She will undergo a chest X-ray, electrocardiogram (ECG), and blood tests including a complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, and cardiac biomarkers. If symptoms persist or worsen, further evaluation for possible pulmonary causes may be necessary.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient is advised to return for a follow-up appointment in one week for reassessment of her condition based on the investigative results. She should contact the clinic immediately if she experiences worsening symptoms such as increased shortness of breath, persistent chest pain, or coughing up blood. She will also be scheduled for a cardiology consultation to further evaluate and manage her heart failure.
