Clinic or Hospital Location: Harjavalta  

Patient Gender: Female  
Patient Age: 3 years old  

Severity Level: 2 (Emergent – potential life threat)

Chief Complaint: The patient, a 3-year-old female, was brought in by her parents due to acute respiratory distress and increased work of breathing.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient's mother reports that the child has had a mild cough for the past two days, which has progressively worsened over the last 12 hours. She now presents with increased respiratory rate (60 breaths per minute), nasal flaring, retractions, and audible wheezing. The symptoms began suddenly approximately 4 hours prior to arrival at our clinic. There is no known history of atopy in the family, and the child has not received any recent vaccinations or medications.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears anxious but responsive. Her vital signs are as follows: Temperature 37.2°C (99°F), Heart rate 160 bpm, Respiratory rate 60 breaths/min, Oxygen saturation 88% on room air, and Blood pressure 90/55 mmHg. Auscultation reveals bilateral wheezing throughout respiration with prolonged expiratory phase. Cardiovascular examination shows tachycardia without murmurs or gallops. The abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended with active bowel sounds. Extremities show good peripheral pulses. Neurological examination is unremarkable.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Based on the patient's presentation, history, and physical examination findings, she meets criteria for an acute asthma exacerbation. The severity of her respiratory distress suggests a moderate to severe episode requiring immediate intervention.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be administered a nebulized budesonide/formoterol combination (2.5mg/6.25mcg) for immediate relief. Intravenous hydrocortisone (1 mg/kg) will be given to address potential adrenal insufficiency in severe asthma exacerbations. Continuous oxygen therapy via nasal cannula at 2 L/min will be provided to maintain adequate oxygenation levels. Close monitoring of vital signs and respiratory status is essential during treatment.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient requires close observation in our pediatric unit for at least the next 4-6 hours post-treatment, with repeated assessments of respiratory status and oxygenation. If there is no improvement or worsening of symptoms, further investigations including chest X-ray and potential referral to a pediatric pulmonologist may be necessary. The family will be provided with a written asthma action plan for future episodes and advised on environmental modifications at home to minimize triggers. A follow-up appointment should be scheduled within one week for reassessment and ongoing management.
