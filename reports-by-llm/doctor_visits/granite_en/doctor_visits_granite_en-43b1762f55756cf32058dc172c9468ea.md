Visit Date: 12.01.2025  
Clinic or Hospital Location: Laitila  

Patient Gender: Male  
Patient Age: 63  

Severity Level: 4 (Less-urgent â€“ stable, stable, 1 resource)

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with a persistent cough and progressive shortness of breath for the past two weeks. He also reports intermittent chest pain and occasional wheezing.

History of Present Illness (HPI):  
The 63-year-old male patient reports the onset of a persistent dry cough approximately two weeks ago, which has been gradually worsening. He describes the cough as non-productive and occasionally brings up small amounts of white mucus. The patient also mentions experiencing progressive shortness of breath, particularly during exertion, which has limited his daily activities. He reports intermittent chest pain, described as a sharp, stabbing sensation, and occasional wheezing, especially at night. There is no history of fever, chills, or hemoptysis. The patient has a history of hypertension and is currently on antihypertensive medication. He denies any recent travel, sick contacts, or known allergies.

Physical Examination Findings:  
Vital signs: Blood pressure 140/90 mmHg, heart rate 90 bpm, respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation 92% on room air.  
General appearance: The patient appears mildly distressed and fatigued.  
HEENT: Normocephalic, atraumatic. Pupils equal, round, and reactive to light. Oropharynx clear.  
Cardiovascular: Regular rhythm, mildly tachycardic. No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  
Lungs: Decreased breath sounds bilaterally with occasional wheezing heard throughout.  
Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, no organomegaly.  
Extremities: No peripheral edema.  

Assessment / Diagnosis:  
Based on the patient's history and physical examination findings, the working diagnosis is acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with possible superimposed bacterial pneumonia. The patient's hypertension and recent symptom progression warrant further investigation to rule out other differentials such as heart failure or pulmonary embolism.

Plan / Treatment:  
1. Order chest X-ray to evaluate for pneumonia or other lung pathology.
2. Initiate treatment with a short-acting bronchodilator (albuterol) via nebulizer for immediate symptom relief.
3. Prescribe a course of oral antibiotics (e.g., azithromycin) to address possible bacterial infection, pending culture results if obtained.
4. Instruct the patient to use a short-acting inhaled corticosteroid (e.g., fluticasone) as prescribed for long-term COPD management.
5. Recommend increased use of short-acting bronchodilators as needed for symptom control.
6. Advise the patient to schedule a follow-up appointment in one week for reassessment and potential adjustment of therapy based on response and ongoing symptoms.
7. Encourage smoking cessation if applicable, and discuss pulmonary rehabilitation as an option for improved functional capacity.

Follow-up Instructions:  
The patient is scheduled to return in one week for a follow-up appointment to assess symptom improvement and treatment response. If there is no improvement or worsening of symptoms prior to the scheduled visit, the patient should contact the clinic for further evaluation. In the meantime, the patient should continue monitoring his oxygen saturation levels at home using a pulse oximeter and report any significant changes or worsening symptoms immediately.
