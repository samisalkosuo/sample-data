Patient Gender: Male  
Patient Age: 45  

Severity Level: 3 (Urgent – stable, needs 2+ resources)

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with a persistent cough, shortness of breath, and intermittent chest pain for the past two weeks. He reports increased symptoms over the last 48 hours.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient is a 45-year-old male who initially sought care for a persistent dry cough and mild fatigue. Over the subsequent days, he developed intermittent chest pain, worsening shortness of breath, and occasional low-grade fevers. He denies any recent travel, sick contacts, or known allergies. His occupation involves working with dust and machinery, but he reports no recent exposure to new substances.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears mildly distressed. Vital signs are as follows: Temperature 37.2°C (99°F), Blood Pressure 140/90 mmHg, Heart Rate 95 bpm, and Respiratory Rate 20 breaths per minute. Auscultation reveals bilateral wheezing and decreased air entry in the lower lung fields. Percussion elicits dullness in the right lower lung lobe, suggestive of possible consolidation.

Assessment / Diagnosis: The patient's presentation is concerning for a possible acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), potentially complicated by pneumonia. Further investigations, including chest X-ray and arterial blood gas analysis, are recommended to confirm the diagnosis and assess the severity.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be initiated on a course of oral corticosteroids (prednisolone 40mg daily) and antibiotics (azithromycin 500mg once daily) for suspected pneumonia. He will also receive a short-acting bronchodilator (salbutamol inhaler as needed for symptom relief). The patient will be referred for a chest X-ray and arterial blood gas analysis. He will be advised to avoid strenuous activities until further evaluation is complete.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient should return for a follow-up appointment in one week or sooner if symptoms worsen. He will also need to schedule a separate appointment for the chest X-ray and arterial blood gas analysis results discussion. The patient has been provided with written instructions regarding medication usage, potential side effects, and when to seek immediate medical attention.
