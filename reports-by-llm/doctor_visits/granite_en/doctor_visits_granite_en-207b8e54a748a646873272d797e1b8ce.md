Visit Date: 22.11.2024  
Clinic or Hospital Location: Toivakka  

Patient Gender: Male  
Patient Age: 81  

Severity Level: 4 (Less-urgent â€“ stable, stable, 1 resource)

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with progressive dyspnea and a productive cough for the past week. He reports increased shortness of breath during minimal exertion and occasional hemoptysis.

History of Present Illness (HPI): An 81-year-old male presents with a one-week history of worsening dyspnea and a productive cough, producing yellowish sputum. He reports increased shortness of breath during minimal exertion and occasional episodes of hemoptysis (coughing up blood). The patient denies fever, chest pain, or recent weight loss. His past medical history is significant for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and a history of smoking (50 pack-years).

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears mildly distressed but is in stable condition. Vital signs are within normal limits. Auscultation reveals bilateral basal crackles and decreased breath sounds. Oxygen saturation on room air is 88%, improving to 94% with supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula at 2L/min. Cardiovascular examination shows regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. There are no peripheral edema or clubbing.

Assessment / Diagnosis: The patient's presentation is consistent with an acute exacerbation of COPD, likely secondary to a lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI). Chest radiography reveals patchy opacities in the right middle and lower lobes, suggestive of consolidation.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be initiated on a course of oral antibiotics (Levofloxacin 500mg once daily for 7 days) to treat the suspected LRTI. Inhaled bronchodilators (Salbutamol/Albuterol inhaler as needed for dyspnea) and systemic corticosteroids (Prednisone 40mg once daily for 5 days) will be prescribed to manage acute exacerbation symptoms. The patient will also receive supplemental oxygen as required during the visit and at home.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient is advised to follow up in one week or sooner if symptoms worsen, particularly if he experiences increased dyspnea, persistent fever, or hemoptysis. He should also seek immediate medical attention for any signs of respiratory distress or deterioration in his condition.
