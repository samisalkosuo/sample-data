Patient Gender: Female
Patient Age: 86

Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with a two-day history of progressive shortness of breath and mild chest discomfort. She reports feeling more fatigued than usual and has noticed swelling in her lower extremities.

History of Present Illness (HPI): An 86-year-old female presents with a two-day history of progressive shortness of breath, described as exertional dyspnea, and mild chest discomfort. She reports feeling more fatigued than usual and has noticed swelling in her lower extremities, particularly in the ankles. The patient denies any cough, fever, or recent weight changes. Her past medical history is significant for hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) on long-term home oxygen therapy. She takes warfarin, lisinopril, and salmeterol as prescribed.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears her stated age and is in mild distress due to shortness of breath. Vital signs are within normal limits except for a slightly elevated heart rate of 98 bpm and a respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute. Oxygen saturation on room air is 88%. Lung auscultation reveals bilateral basal crackles. Cardiovascular examination shows regular rhythm with a rate of 98 bpm and no murmurs. There is mild pitting edema in the lower extremities up to the knees.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's age, history of COPD, atrial fibrillation, and current symptoms of exertional dyspnea, orthopnea, and peripheral edema, a likely diagnosis of acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) exacerbated by her COPD is made.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be started on intravenous furosemide for diuresis, with close monitoring of renal function and electrolytes. Intravenous morphine sulfate will be administered for symptomatic relief of dyspnea. She will also receive supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula to maintain oxygen saturation above 90%. Further workup, including a chest X-ray and echocardiogram, is planned. The patient's warfarin therapy will be held temporarily, pending consultation with the cardiologist.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient should follow up with her primary care physician in one week for further management of her heart failure and COPD. She should also schedule a follow-up appointment with the cardiology team within the next two weeks for a more detailed evaluation and potential adjustment of her medications. In the meantime, she should monitor her weight daily and report any worsening symptoms promptly.
