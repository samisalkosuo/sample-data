30.05.2024, Hein√§vesi Clinic Visit Report:

Chief Complaint: A 17-year-old female patient presents with a 3-day history of progressive abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient reports that the pain started gradually in the lower abdomen and has been worsening over the past three days. It is now sharp, constant, and rated as 8/10 in severity. The pain is not associated with any fever, chills, or diarrhea but has caused her to miss school. She denies any recent trauma, abdominal surgeries, or significant weight loss.

Physical Examination Findings: On examination, the patient appears her stated age and is in moderate distress due to pain. Her vital signs are within normal limits. Abdominal examination reveals guarding and rebound tenderness in the lower quadrants, with no masses or organomegaly detected. Bowel sounds are hyperactive but present.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's age, symptoms, and physical findings, a working diagnosis of acute appendicitis is considered. This assessment aligns with severity level 2 (emergent - potential life threat) due to the risk of rupture and subsequent peritonitis if left untreated.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be referred immediately for an abdominal CT scan to confirm the diagnosis. If confirmed, she will require emergency appendicectomy. Pain management with intravenous fluids and analgesics (e.g., morphine) will be initiated as needed. Antiemetics may also be administered to control nausea and vomiting.

Follow-up Instructions: Following the procedure, the patient should follow up in clinic within one week for wound inspection and removal of sutures if applicable. She will also need to schedule a post-operative appointment with the surgeon as per their instructions. In the meantime, she must maintain a clear liquid diet and gradually advance to soft foods as tolerated.
