Patient Age: 35

Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with a persistent, sharp, non-radiating chest pain of four days duration, associated with shortness of breath and intermittent palpitations.

History of Present Illness (HPI): A 35-year-old male reports the onset of chest discomfort four days ago, initially described as a pressure sensation in the center of his chest. The pain has remained constant, rated as 7/10 in severity, and is exacerbated with exertion or emotional stress. He also complains of intermittent shortness of breath, particularly during physical activities, and episodes of palpitations that last for a few seconds. There are no known cardiac risk factors, and he denies any recent trauma, fever, cough, or sick contact.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears anxious but is in stable condition. Vital signs are within normal limits. Cardiovascular examination reveals regular rhythm with a rate of 80 bpm and no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Lungs are clear bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended with normoactive bowels. Extremities show no edema, and peripheral pulses are equal and strong bilaterally. Neurological examination is unremarkable.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's history, physical examination findings, and persistent chest pain without clear alternative explanations, a working diagnosis of non-cardiac chest pain (NCCP) or possible early cardiac etiology (e.g., pericarditis) is considered. Further investigations are warranted to rule out serious cardiac conditions.

Plan / Treatment:
1. Order an ECG and complete blood count (CBC).
2. Prescribe a short-acting beta-agonist (albuterol) inhaler for possible reactive airway disease, given the patient's complaints of shortness of breath.
3. Advise the patient to avoid strenuous activities until further evaluation.
4. Schedule an appointment with a cardiologist for further assessment and potential echocardiogram within the next 72 hours.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient is advised to return to the clinic in 48 hours for review of investigations and management plan or sooner if symptoms worsen. He should also contact emergency services immediately if he experiences worsening chest pain, severe shortness of breath, or syncope.
