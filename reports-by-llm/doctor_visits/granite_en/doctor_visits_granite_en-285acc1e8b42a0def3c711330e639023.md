Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient, a 12-year-old female, presents with a 3-day history of progressive abdominal pain, fever, and decreased appetite.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient first noticed mild abdominal discomfort two days ago, which has since escalated to severe, constant pain localized to the right lower quadrant. The pain is exacerbated by movement and is associated with nausea but no vomiting or diarrhea. She has also reported a low-grade fever of 38°C and decreased appetite leading to minimal food intake over the past few days. There are no urinary symptoms, and she denies any recent trauma or changes in bowel habits.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears uncomfortable but is alert and oriented. Her vital signs are within normal limits except for a temperature of 38°C. Abdominal examination reveals guarding, rebound tenderness, and palpable mass in the right lower quadrant. Bowel sounds are hyperactive, and there is no rebound or flank tenderness. The rest of the physical examination is unremarkable.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's age, presentation with right lower quadrant abdominal pain, fever, decreased appetite, guarding, rebound tenderness, and palpable mass, a presumptive diagnosis of appendicitis is made. Further investigations are warranted to confirm this suspicion.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be admitted for further evaluation, including laboratory tests (complete blood count, C-reactive protein) and imaging studies (ultrasound or CT scan). She will receive intravenous fluids and pain management with appropriate analgesics. If the diagnosis of appendicitis is confirmed, she will undergo emergency appendectomy.

Follow-up Instructions: Following discharge, the patient should follow up in the surgical clinic within one week for suture removal and to ensure adequate recovery. She should also return if she experiences worsening abdominal pain, fever, or any other concerning symptoms before the scheduled follow-up.
