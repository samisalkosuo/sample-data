Clinic or Hospital Location: Pyhäranta  

Patient Gender: Male  
Patient Age: 30  

Severity Level: 5 (Non-urgent – minor complaints)

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with a persistent cough and mild fatigue for the past two weeks. He reports occasional nasal congestion and a low-grade fever.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 30-year-old male, has been experiencing a dry cough, intermittent nasal congestion, and mild fatigue for approximately two weeks. He denies any chest pain, shortness of breath, or wheezing. The fever is usually less than 101°F (38.3°C) and self-resolves within a day. He reports no recent travel, sick contacts, or known allergies.

Physical Examination Findings: Vital signs are within normal limits. Auscultation of the lungs reveals mild scattered wheezes without rhales or rhonchi. The patient's oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. There are no other abnormal findings on head, neck, or extremities examination.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Based on the history and physical examination, the patient likely has a viral upper respiratory tract infection (URTI), possibly with a superimposed allergic component causing his symptoms.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be prescribed an over-the-counter antihistamine for potential allergy symptoms and advised to maintain hydration. He will be referred to an allergist for further evaluation if symptoms persist or worsen. No further intervention is required at this time, as the condition is self-limiting.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient should follow up with his primary care provider if symptoms worsen, do not improve within one week, or if he develops new concerning symptoms such as high fever, chest pain, or shortness of breath. He can schedule an appointment at his convenience or contact the clinic for further guidance.
