Patient Gender: Male
Patient Age: 82

Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with acute onset of severe chest pain, shortness of breath, and diaphoresis.

History of Present Illness (HPI): An 82-year-old male reports experiencing sudden, crushing substernal chest pain radiating to the left arm, accompanied by diaphoresis and shortness of breath, which began approximately one hour ago while at rest. The patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia but no known history of coronary artery disease. He denies any preceding exertion or emotional stress.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears distressed, diaphoretic, and in moderate respiratory distress. Vital signs reveal a blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg, heart rate of 110 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 88% on room air, and temperature of 98.6°F. Cardiovascular examination demonstrates irregular heart rhythm with a possible murmur. Lungs are bilaterally clear to auscultation. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended. Extremities show no edema, and peripheral pulses are intact. Neurological examination is unremarkable.

Assessment / Diagnosis: The patient's presentation is suggestive of an acute coronary syndrome (ACS), likely unstable angina or non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). Given the severity and potential for life threat, immediate cardiac evaluation and management are warranted.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be administered aspirin 325 mg, sublingual nitroglycerin 0.4 mg, and morphine sulfate 2 mg for symptom relief. Continuous ECG monitoring is initiated, and laboratory tests including cardiac biomarkers (troponin I and CK-MB) are ordered. The patient will be transferred to a nearby cardiac catheterization lab for further evaluation and potential intervention.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient requires immediate transfer to the nearest cardiac catheterization lab for possible percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Upon stabilization, he should follow up with a cardiologist within one week for further management and long-term care planning. Regular follow-ups will be scheduled as indicated by his cardiologist to monitor his condition and adjust treatment accordingly. The patient's primary care provider is also notified of this urgent situation.
