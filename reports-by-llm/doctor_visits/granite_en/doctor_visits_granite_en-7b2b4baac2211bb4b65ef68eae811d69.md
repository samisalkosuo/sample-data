Clinic or Hospital Location: Marttila  

Patient Gender: Female  
Patient Age: 53  

Severity Level: 4 (Less-urgent â€“ stable, stable, 1 resource)

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with a persistent cough and progressive shortness of breath for the past three weeks. She also reports intermittent chest pain and occasional wheezing.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 53-year-old female, reports the onset of her symptoms approximately three weeks ago. Initially, she experienced a dry cough and mild fatigue, which have since progressed to include increasing dyspnea, chest tightness, and occasional sharp chest pain exacerbated by physical activity. She denies any recent travel, sick contacts, or known allergies. Her past medical history is significant for well-controlled hypertension and seasonal allergies. She is a non-smoker and reports no history of respiratory illnesses.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears mildly distressed but is in stable condition. Vital signs are within normal limits. Auscultation reveals decreased breath sounds in the right lower lobe with occasional wheezing and crackles. Palpation of the chest wall elicits tenderness over the right lower rib area. The remainder of the physical examination is unremarkable.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Based on the patient's history, physical examination findings, and consideration of her medical background, a working diagnosis of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with possible right lower lobe pneumonia is made. Further diagnostic testing, including chest X-ray and spirometry, will be pursued to confirm this assessment.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will receive a course of oral antibiotics (Amoxicillin 500mg tid for 7 days) targeting possible bacterial pneumonia. She will also be prescribed an inhaled short-acting bronchodilator (Albuterol inhaler prn for rescue) to manage her COPD symptoms. Additionally, she is advised to use a nebulizer with saline solution at home for chest discomfort relief. She will be scheduled for follow-up in one week for reassessment and potential adjustment of therapy based on symptom improvement or deterioration.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient should return for a follow-up appointment in one week to review her progress, assess symptom resolution, and possibly repeat spirometry testing. If there is no improvement or if symptoms worsen before the scheduled follow-up, she should seek immediate medical attention. She will also be provided with instructions on how to interpret her peak flow readings at home and when to contact healthcare services for further evaluation.
