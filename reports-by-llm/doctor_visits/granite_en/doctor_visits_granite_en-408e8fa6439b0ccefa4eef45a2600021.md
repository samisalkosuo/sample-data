30.11.2023 - Parkano Clinic Visit Report

Patient: Male, 97 years old
Severity Level: 4 (Less-urgent)

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with a two-day history of progressive shortness of breath and mild lower extremity edema.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 97-year-old male, reports a gradual onset of dyspnea over the past two days, initially noticed while performing his daily activities. He describes the shortness of breath as worsening with minimal exertion and improving with rest. Additionally, he mentions mild swelling in both lower extremities, which has been increasing over the same period. There is no history of chest pain, cough, fever, or recent weight changes.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears his stated age and is oriented to person, place, and time. Vital signs are as follows: Blood pressure 138/76 mmHg, heart rate 92 beats per minute, respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation 92% on room air, and temperature 98.4Â°F. Cardiovascular examination reveals regular rhythm with a grade 2/6 holosystolic murmur best heard at the apex. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. There is mild pitting edema noted in both lower extremities up to mid-calf level. No peripheral adenopathy is appreciated.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's age, history of progressive dyspnea, and physical examination findings, a likely diagnosis of congestive heart failure exacerbation is made. The mild lower extremity edema suggests venous congestion secondary to cardiac dysfunction.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be initiated on oral furosemide 20mg daily, with instructions to follow up in one week for reassessment. He will also receive a prescription for hydrochlorothiazide 25mg daily as needed for diuresis. The patient is advised to monitor his weight at home and report any worsening symptoms promptly.

Follow-up Instructions: Please schedule a follow-up appointment in one week for reassessment of symptoms, weight, and response to medication. In the interim, the patient should maintain a low-sodium diet and adhere to his prescribed medications. If symptoms worsen or new symptoms develop before the scheduled follow-up, he should seek immediate medical attention.
