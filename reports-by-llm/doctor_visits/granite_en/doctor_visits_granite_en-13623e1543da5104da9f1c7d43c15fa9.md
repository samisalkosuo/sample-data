Patient Information:  
Gender: Female  
Age: 100 years old  

Severity Level: 2 (Emergent – potential life threat)

Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint:  
The patient, a 100-year-old female, presents with acute onset of severe chest pain and shortness of breath. She reports feeling unwell for the past few hours, with symptoms worsening over time.

History of Present Illness (HPI):  
The patient describes a sharp, pleuritic chest pain that started approximately three hours ago. The pain radiates to her left arm and is associated with diaphoresis and nausea. She has a history of hypertension and atrial fibrillation, for which she takes warfarin and metoprolol. She denies any recent trauma, fever, cough, or sputum production.

Physical Examination Findings:  
Vital signs: Blood pressure 160/90 mmHg, heart rate 120 bpm, respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation 88% on room air. She appears distressed and diaphoretic.  

Cardiovascular: Regular but rapid rate and rhythm, no murmurs or gallops noted.  

Lungs: Decreased breath sounds on the left side, bilateral wheezing audible.  

Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, no organomegaly.  

Neurological: Alert and oriented to person, place, and time; no focal deficits.

Assessment / Diagnosis:  
The patient's presentation is concerning for an acute coronary syndrome (ACS), specifically unstable angina or non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The severity of symptoms, elevated troponin levels, and ECG changes support this diagnosis.

Plan / Treatment:  
1. Immediate ECG to assess for any dynamic changes.
2. Administer sublingual nitroglycerin for pain relief.
3. Start intravenous morphine for pain control and potential vasodilation.
4. Obtain laboratory tests, including cardiac enzymes (troponin, CK-MB) and complete blood count.
5. Initiate heparin infusion for anticoagulation due to history of atrial fibrillation and recent onset ACS.
6. Consult cardiology for further management and potential angiography.
7. Admit the patient to the cardiac care unit (CCU) for continuous monitoring.

Follow-up Instructions:  
The patient will be closely monitored in the CCU. Cardiology consultation will provide further recommendations regarding interventional procedures or long-term management strategies. The patient should follow up with her primary care physician and cardiologist within one week of discharge for ongoing care and medication adjustments.
