Chief Complaint: A 90-year-old female patient presents with progressive dyspnea and mild chest pain of one-day duration.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a non-smoker with a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), reports experiencing worsening shortness of breath and mild chest discomfort over the past 24 hours. She denies any recent infections or trauma. Her symptoms are exacerbated by minimal exertion and are partially relieved by sitting upright.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears mildly distressed but is oriented to person, place, and time. Vital signs reveal a blood pressure of 140/80 mmHg, heart rate of 95 bpm, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 88% on room air, and temperature of 36.8째C. Auscultation of the lungs reveals bilateral basal crackles. Cardiovascular examination shows irregular rhythm with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. There is no peripheral edema noted.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's age, history of cardiac and respiratory comorbidities, and current symptoms, she likely has an acute exacerbation of her COPD, possibly precipitated by atrial fibrillation-related fluid overload. The severity level is considered 2 (emergent) due to potential life threat from respiratory distress.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be initiated on a nebulized bronchodilator treatment with albuterol and ipratropium. Intravenous diuretics (furosemide) will be administered to manage fluid overload. Continuous cardiac monitoring is recommended, along with laboratory investigations including electrolytes, renal function, and cardiac biomarkers. The patient will be admitted for further management and observation.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient should follow up with her primary care physician within one week of discharge to reassess her condition and adjust medication as needed. She must also schedule a follow-up appointment with the cardiology department for further evaluation and management of her atrial fibrillation. In the meantime, she should maintain close contact with her healthcare provider for any worsening symptoms or concerns.
