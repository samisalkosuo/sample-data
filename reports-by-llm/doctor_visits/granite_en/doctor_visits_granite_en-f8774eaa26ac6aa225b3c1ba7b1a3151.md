07.02.2025, Äänekoski Clinic Visit Report

Chief Complaint:
The patient, a 98-year-old male, presents with progressive dyspnea and increased fatigue over the past week.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient reports a gradual onset of shortness of breath during daily activities, which has worsened over the past seven days. He describes mild chest discomfort and occasional palpitations. There is no history of fever, cough, or hemoptysis. The patient's functional status has declined, with decreased exercise tolerance and an increased need for rest.

Physical Examination Findings:
Vital signs: Blood pressure 130/80 mmHg, heart rate 95 bpm, respiratory rate 24 breaths/min, oxygen saturation 88% on room air. The patient appears elderly, cachectic, and in mild distress. Auscultation reveals bilateral basal crackles and a faint third heart sound. There is no jugular venous distention or lower extremity edema.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
Given the patient's age, progressive dyspnea, and findings on physical examination, a likely diagnosis of congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation is made. Further evaluation with an echocardiogram and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels is recommended to confirm the diagnosis and assess left ventricular function.

Plan / Treatment:
1. Prescribe furosemide 20mg PO daily for diuresis.
2. Initiate lisinopril 5mg PO daily for afterload reduction.
3. Administer oxygen therapy via nasal cannula at 2L/min to maintain oxygen saturation above 90%.
4. Schedule an echocardiogram and BNP level testing within the next 48 hours.
5. Consult with a cardiologist for further management.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient should return for a follow-up appointment in one week to assess response to treatment and adjust therapy as needed. In the interim, he should maintain close contact with the clinic for any worsening symptoms or concerns.
