Chief Complaint: The patient, a 76-year-old male, presents with progressive dyspnea and lower extremity edema of one week's duration.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient reports a gradual onset of shortness of breath at rest, which has worsened over the past week. He describes orthopneic positioning to alleviate symptoms and reports a 3-pound weight gain in the same period, along with bilateral lower extremity swelling up to the knees. There is no known history of heart failure, but he has a past medical history significant for hypertension and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) on long-term home oxygen therapy.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears mildly distressed, using accessory muscles for respiration. Vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 140/90 mmHg, heart rate 105 bpm, respiratory rate 28 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation 88% on room air, and temperature 98.6째F. Auscultation reveals bilateral crackles in the lung bases and a III/VI holosystolic murmur best heard at the right sternal border. Lower extremities show 2+ pitting edema up to the knees.

Assessment / Diagnosis: The patient's presentation is concerning for acute exacerbation of heart failure with congestion, likely secondary to poorly controlled hypertension and underlying COPD. Further evaluation with an echocardiogram and cardiac biomarkers is recommended to confirm the diagnosis and assess left ventricular function.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be initiated on intravenous furosemide 40mg, oral torsemide 10mg daily, and oral lisinopril 20mg daily for blood pressure and heart failure management. He will also receive supplemental oxygen as needed to maintain oxygen saturation above 90%. The patient's home medications, including inhaled bronchodilators and long-acting anticholinergics, will be optimized based on the echocardiogram results.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient should return for a follow-up appointment in one week to reassess symptoms, review medication adjustments, and obtain echocardiogram results. If there is any worsening of dyspnea or the development of new symptoms before this appointment, he should seek immediate medical attention.
