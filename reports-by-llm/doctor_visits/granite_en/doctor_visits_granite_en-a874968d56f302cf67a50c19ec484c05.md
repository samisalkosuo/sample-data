Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient, a 94-year-old male, presents with acute onset confusion and disorientation, reported by his caregiver. He has also experienced a sudden decline in oral intake and increased lethargy over the past 2 days.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient's caregiver reports that he has been progressively more confused since yesterday, with difficulty following simple commands and orienting to person, place, and time. He has also shown a significant decrease in his usual oral intake, consuming only small amounts of liquids. The patient's lethargy has increased, with minimal verbalization and reduced movement. There is no history of recent falls, head trauma, or fever.

Physical Examination Findings: On examination, the patient appears alert but confused, with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 12 (Eye opening: 4, Verbal response: 3, Motor response: 5). Vital signs are within normal limits. Neurological examination reveals no focal deficits. Cardiovascular and respiratory systems are stable. Abdominal examination is unremarkable, with no tenderness or organomegaly.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's age, acute onset confusion, decreased oral intake, and lethargy, a differential diagnosis of delirium, urinary tract infection (UTI), or sepsis is considered. Further investigations are required to differentiate between these possibilities.

Plan / Treatment:
1. Complete blood count (CBC) with differential, comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), urinalysis, and urine culture to rule out infection.
2. Non-contrast head computed tomography (CT) scan to assess for intracranial pathology.
3. Intravenous hydration and electrolyte monitoring.
4. Consultation with the geriatric or internal medicine service for further management.
5. Close monitoring for any changes in mental status or vital signs.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the facility for at least 24 hours, with daily reviews by the healthcare team. Further management and follow-up will depend on the results of the investigations. The caregiver is advised to report any changes in the patient's condition promptly.
