Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with acute onset of severe chest pain, shortness of breath, and diaphoresis.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 58-year-old male, reports the sudden onset of intense, crushing chest pain radiating to his left arm, accompanied by dyspnea and profuse sweating, which began approximately one hour ago while at rest. He denies any preceding exertion or emotional stress. He has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia but is not currently on medication due to non-compliance. He reports no known allergies.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears anxious and diaphoretic. His vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 160/95 mmHg, heart rate 110 bpm, respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation 88% on room air, and temperature 37°C. Cardiovascular exam reveals irregularly irregular heartbeat with a rate of 110 bpm, hypotension upon standing, and a III/VI holosystolic murmur heard best at the apex. Lungs are bilaterally diminished with coarse crackles at the bases. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended with no organomegaly noted. Extremities show no edema or cyanosis. Neurological exam is non-focal.

Assessment / Diagnosis: The patient's presentation is highly suggestive of an acute coronary syndrome, likely unstable angina or a possible non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). Urgent cardiac workup including ECG and cardiac biomarkers is indicated.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be administered sublingual nitroglycerin for immediate relief of chest pain, aspirin 325 mg, and oxygen via nasal cannula at 4 L/min to maintain oxygen saturation above 90%. He will undergo an urgent ECG and cardiac biomarkers (troponin I and CK-MB). If the results are positive for myocardial injury, he will be admitted for further management, including possible thrombolysis or percutaneous coronary intervention.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient should return to the emergency department within 24 hours for a follow-up evaluation based on his cardiac workup results and clinical response to initial treatment. He is strongly encouraged to establish care with a primary care provider or cardiologist for ongoing management of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and smoking cessation counseling if applicable.
