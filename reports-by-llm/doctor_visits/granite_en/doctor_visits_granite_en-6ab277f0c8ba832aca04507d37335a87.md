Clinic or Hospital Location: Kemiönsaari  

Severity Level: 3 (Urgent – stable, needs 2+ resources)  

Patient Gender: Female  
Patient Age: 26  

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with acute abdominal pain, severe cramping, and intermittent nausea. She reports feeling unwell since yesterday evening, with symptoms worsening overnight.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient describes the pain as constant, sharp, and localized to the lower quadrants of her abdomen, radiating to her back. She rates the pain as 8/10 in severity. There is no associated fever, vomiting, or diarrhea. Menstruation began three days ago, but she reports it has been heavier and more painful than usual.

Physical Examination Findings: Vital signs are within normal limits. Abdominal examination reveals guarding, rebound tenderness, and mild voluntary abdominal muscle contractions in the lower quadrants. No rebound or guarding in the supine position. Bowel sounds are hyperactive. There is no costovertebral angle tenderness or rebound.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Based on the patient's presentation, physical examination findings, and menstrual history, a working diagnosis of acute pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) or possible ectopic pregnancy is considered. Further investigations are warranted to rule out these conditions.

Plan / Treatment:
1. Order a urine pregnancy test and complete blood count (CBC).
2. Administer intravenous fluids for hydration and pain relief with meperidine 50mg IM as needed.
3. Admit the patient for further evaluation and management, including possible ultrasound imaging.
4. Consult gynecology for potential endocervical or transvaginal ultrasound.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be contacted regarding test results and further management plans within 24 hours. She is advised to return to the clinic if symptoms worsen, especially if fever develops, or if she experiences dizziness, lightheadedness, or severe lower extremity pain.
