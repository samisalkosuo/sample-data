Patient Gender: Male
Patient Age: 26

Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with a persistent, non-productive cough and progressive dyspnea for the past two weeks. He reports intermittent chest pain, worsening at night, and occasional hemoptysis.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The 26-year-old male patient reports the onset of his symptoms approximately two weeks ago. Initially, he experienced a dry cough and mild dyspnea, which have since progressed. He describes the current cough as non-productive, with occasional streaks of blood (hemoptysis). The chest pain is described as sharp, intermittent, and worsening at night, radiating to his left arm. He denies fever, night sweats, or recent weight loss.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears mildly distressed but in no immediate respiratory distress. Vital signs are within normal limits. Auscultation reveals bilateral basal crackles and decreased breath sounds on the left side. Percussion tenderness is noted over the left lower thoracic region. There is no evidence of jugular venous distension or cyanosis.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's history, physical examination findings, and progressive symptoms, a likely diagnosis of pneumonia with possible pleural effusion is suspected. Further diagnostic testing, including chest X-ray and possibly sputum culture, is recommended to confirm this assessment and guide treatment.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be started on a course of oral antibiotics (e.g., Levofloxacin 500mg once daily) targeting common respiratory pathogens. He will also receive an inhaler with a bronchodilator (e.g., Salbutamol) for symptomatic relief of dyspnea. Pain management with acetaminophen or ibuprofen as needed is advised. The patient should rest and increase fluid intake.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient is scheduled for a follow-up appointment in one week to reassess his condition. If symptoms worsen before this appointment, he should seek immediate medical attention. He will also need to return for diagnostic testing results and potential adjustment of treatment as per those findings.
