02.04.2024 - Simo Clinic Visit Report

Patient: Female, 87 years old
Severity Level: 3 (Urgent)

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with progressive shortness of breath and lower extremity edema over the past week.

History of Present Illness (HPI): An 87-year-old female reports a one-week history of worsening dyspnea at rest and orthopnea, along with noticeable swelling in her lower extremities. She denies any chest pain, cough, or fever. Her symptoms have been gradually worsening, leading to difficulty performing daily activities and occasional anxiety.

Physical Examination Findings: On examination, the patient appears mildly distressed but is oriented to person, place, and time. Vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 140/90 mmHg, heart rate 95 bpm, respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation 88% on room air, and temperature 98.6Â°F. Cardiovascular exam reveals a regular rhythm with a third heart sound and mild S3 gallop. Lungs are bilaterally diffusely crackles. Lower extremities show 2+ pitting edema up to the knees. Abdominal exam is benign, and there is no lower extremity deep vein thrombosis noted on compression.

Assessment / Diagnosis: The patient's presentation is consistent with acute exacerbation of chronic heart failure (CHF), likely secondary to poor medication adherence. She also has volume overload, as evidenced by peripheral edema and elevated jugular venous pressure.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be started on intravenous furosemide 40mg for diuresis, along with oral bumetanide 1mg daily. She will also receive a loop diuretics education and counseling regarding medication adherence. Further workup includes an echocardiogram to assess left ventricular function and an electrocardiogram to evaluate for arrhythmias.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient should return in 1 week for a follow-up appointment to reassess her symptoms, weight, and response to treatment. She will also undergo the scheduled echocardiogram and ECG during this visit. If her condition does not improve or worsens before the scheduled follow-up, she should seek immediate medical attention.
