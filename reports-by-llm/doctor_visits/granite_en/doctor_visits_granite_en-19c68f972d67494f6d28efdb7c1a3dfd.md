Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient, a 92-year-old male, presents with sudden onset of severe chest pain and shortness of breath at rest.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient reports experiencing the onset of intense, crushing chest pain radiating to his left arm approximately 30 minutes prior to arrival. He also describes difficulty breathing and a feeling of impending doom. He has no known history of coronary artery disease but has been managing hypertension with medication.

Physical Examination Findings: The patient appears distressed, diaphoretic, and in moderate respiratory distress. His blood pressure is 180/90 mmHg, heart rate is 120 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation is 88% on room air. Auscultation reveals decreased breath sounds in the left lower lung field and a pansystolic murmur. ECG shows ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, and aVF, suggestive of an acute inferior myocardial infarction.

Assessment / Diagnosis: The patient is experiencing an acute inferior myocardial infarction, likely secondary to coronary artery occlusion. This presentation is consistent with the severity level 1, indicating immediate life threat.

Plan / Treatment: Immediate resuscitation measures are initiated, including oxygen therapy, aspirin, nitroglycerin, and sublingual NTG. The patient is urgently transferred to a nearby cardiac catheterization lab for potential percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to restore blood flow in the affected coronary artery. Intravenous access is established for fluid management and administration of additional medications as needed.

Follow-up Instructions: Following successful reperfusion, the patient will be closely monitored in a coronary care unit (CCU) for at least 48 hours. He will require ongoing medical management with antiplatelet therapy, beta-blockers, and statins. A cardiology consultation is recommended for further evaluation and long-term management. The patient should follow up with his primary care provider within one week post-discharge to discuss secondary prevention strategies and optimize medication regimen.
