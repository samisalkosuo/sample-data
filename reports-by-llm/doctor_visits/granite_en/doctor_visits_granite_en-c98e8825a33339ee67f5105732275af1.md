Chief Complaint – The patient presents with acute-onset chest pain, shortness of breath, and diaphoresis.

History of Present Illness (HPI) – The patient, a 56-year-old female, reports experiencing sudden-onset, severe chest pain radiating to her left arm, accompanied by shortness of breath and profuse sweating, which began approximately 30 minutes ago while at rest. She has no known history of coronary artery disease but does have a family history of premature coronary heart disease.

Physical Examination Findings – On presentation, the patient appears anxious and diaphoretic. Her vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 160/95 mmHg, heart rate 120 bpm, respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation 88% on room air, and temperature 37°C. Cardiovascular examination reveals irregular heart rhythm with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Lungs are bilaterally clear to auscultation with tachypnea. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended with normoactive bowels. Extremities show no edema, and peripheral pulses are intact. Neurological examination is non-focal.

Assessment / Diagnosis – The patient's presentation is highly suggestive of an acute coronary syndrome (ACS), specifically unstable angina or a possible non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). Given the severity and nature of her symptoms, immediate cardiac evaluation and management are warranted.

Plan / Treatment – The patient will be administered aspirin 325 mg, sublingual nitroglycerin 0.4 mg under tongue for relief of angina, and morphine sulfate 2 mg intravenously for pain control. She will also receive oxygen via non-rebreather mask to maintain oxygen saturation above 90%. Continuous cardiac monitoring is in place. Blood tests including cardiac biomarkers (troponin I and CK-MB) and a complete blood count are ordered, along with an electrocardiogram (ECG). Given the suspicion of ACS, the patient will be transferred immediately to a nearby cardiac catheterization laboratory for potential intervention.

Follow-up Instructions – The patient will be followed up post-procedure by the cardiology team. She requires strict adherence to prescribed medications and lifestyle modifications as advised by the cardiologist. A follow-up appointment with her primary care provider will be scheduled within one week for ongoing management and further evaluation of risk factors. In the meantime, she should contact her healthcare provider or seek immediate medical attention if symptoms recur or worsen.
