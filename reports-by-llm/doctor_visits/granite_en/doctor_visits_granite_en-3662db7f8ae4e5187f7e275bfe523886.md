Patient Gender: Male
Patient Age: 69

Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with progressive dyspnea and a productive cough for the past week. He reports increased shortness of breath at rest and orthopnea, which has led to significant sleep disturbance.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The 69-year-old male patient reports the onset of his symptoms approximately one week ago. Initially, he experienced a mild cough and occasional chest tightness. Over the past few days, his symptoms have worsened, with increased dyspnea at rest and exertion, leading to orthopnea and nocturnal awakenings due to shortness of breath. He denies any recent travel, sick contacts, or known allergies. His past medical history is significant for well-controlled hypertension and a 20-pack-year smoking history that ceased 15 years ago.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears anxious and in moderate respiratory distress. Vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 140/90 mmHg, heart rate 105 bpm, respiratory rate 28 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation 88% on room air, and temperature 37Â°C. Auscultation reveals bilateral basal crackles and decreased breath sounds. Cardiovascular examination shows regular rhythm with a III/VI holosystolic murmur best heard at the right sternal border. There is no peripheral edema, but jugular venous pressure is mildly elevated at 10 cmH2O in the semirecumbent position.

Assessment / Diagnosis: The patient's presentation is consistent with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). His history of significant smoking, recent symptom onset, and physical examination findings support this diagnosis.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be initiated on a course of systemic corticosteroids (prednisolone 40 mg daily) and antibiotics (azithromycin 500 mg once daily) for suspected bacterial exacerbation. He will also receive inhaled bronchodilators (salbutamol and ipratropium) as needed for acute bronchospasm. Oxygen therapy via nasal cannula at 2 L/min has been initiated to maintain oxygen saturation above 90%. The patient will be closely monitored for clinical improvement and potential need for hospital admission if symptoms do not improve within 48 hours or worsen.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient is advised to return for a follow-up appointment in one week or sooner if symptoms worsen. He should also schedule an appointment with a pulmonologist for further evaluation and management of his COPD. Additionally, he will be referred for smoking cessation counseling and pulmonary rehabilitation to improve functional capacity and quality of life.
