Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with a 3-day history of progressive abdominal pain, severe nausea, and vomiting. She reports feeling generally unwell with fever and chills.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient is a 21-year-old female who began experiencing epigastric abdominal pain approximately three days ago. The pain has been constant, sharp, and worsening in intensity. She describes it as a 7/10 on the numerical rating scale. Associated symptoms include non-bloody, non-mucous diarrhea (3-4 times daily), severe nausea leading to episodic vomiting, fever up to 38.5°C, chills, and subjective fever. She denies any recent travel, sick contacts, or new medication use.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears moderately distressed but is in stable condition. Vital signs are within normal limits except for a temperature of 38.2°C and mild tachycardia at 105 bpm. Abdominal examination reveals guarding, rebound tenderness, and mild distension in the epigastric region with no rebound or rigidity. Bowel sounds are hyperactive but present. There is no costovertebral angle tenderness or organomegaly.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's presentation of severe abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, fever, and positive Guaiac test for occult blood in stool, a working diagnosis of acute appendicitis is considered. Further investigations are warranted to confirm this suspicion.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will undergo an abdominal ultrasound and possibly a CT scan to evaluate the appendix and rule out other differentials. She will be started on intravenous fluids for hydration and pain management with IV diclofenac. Blood tests, including a complete blood count and inflammatory markers (CRP, ESR), will be ordered. Surgical consultation is recommended for potential appendectomy if imaging confirms the diagnosis.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient should return to the clinic in 48 hours post-imaging studies for review of results and further management plans. If symptoms worsen or if she develops right lower quadrant guarding, rebound tenderness, or fixed pain before this appointment, she must seek immediate medical attention.
