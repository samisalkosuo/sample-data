Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with a chief complaint of progressive dyspnea and lower extremity edema.

History of Present Illness (HPI):  
The 78-year-old female reports a gradual onset of shortness of breath over the past two weeks, initially noticed during mild exertion but now occurring at rest. She describes her current dyspnea as a 4/10 on the visual analog scale. Additionally, she has experienced worsening lower extremity swelling, particularly in her ankles and feet, over the past month. There is no history of chest pain, cough, or fever. She denies any recent weight changes but mentions a 10-pound unexplained weight gain in the last three months. Her past medical history is significant for hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and atrial fibrillation on anticoagulation therapy.

Physical Examination Findings:  
Vital signs: Blood pressure 140/80 mmHg, heart rate 90 bpm, respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation 92% on room air.  
General appearance: The patient appears her stated age, in mild distress due to dyspnea.  
HEENT: Normocephalic, atraumatic. Pupils equal, round, and reactive to light. Oropharynx clear.  
Cardiovascular: Regular rhythm, rate 90 bpm, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. S1 and S2 audible.  
Lungs: Decreased breath sounds in the bases, bibasilar crackles.  
Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, no organomegaly.  
Extremities: Mild pitting edema in the lower extremities, more pronounced in the feet. No erythema or warmth.  
Neurological: Alert and oriented to person, place, and time. Cranial nerves II-XII intact.

Assessment / Diagnosis:  
The patient's symptoms of progressive dyspnea, lower extremity edema, and known history of cardiovascular comorbidities (hypertension, atrial fibrillation) raise concern for congestive heart failure (CHF). Further evaluation with an echocardiogram and laboratory tests is recommended to confirm the diagnosis.

Plan / Treatment:  
1. Prescribe furosemide 20mg PO daily for diuresis.
2. Instruct patient to monitor daily weight and report any significant changes or worsening symptoms.
3. Schedule an echocardiogram within the next week to assess cardiac function.
4. Refer to a cardiologist for further management of CHF, considering possible adjustments in antiarrhythmic medications.
5. Encourage adherence to a low-sodium diet and regular physical activity as tolerated.

Follow-up Instructions:  
The patient is scheduled for a follow-up appointment in two weeks or sooner if symptoms worsen. She should contact the clinic immediately if she experiences increased dyspnea, chest pain, or severe lower extremity swelling.
