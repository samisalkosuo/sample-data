Clinic or Hospital Location: Soini  

Patient Gender: Female  
Patient Age: 59  

Severity Level: 3 (Urgent â€“ stable, needs 2+ resources)

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with a persistent cough and progressive shortness of breath for the past two weeks. She also reports intermittent chest pain and occasional wheezing.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The 59-year-old female patient reports the onset of her symptoms approximately two weeks ago. Initially, she experienced a dry cough and mild fatigue, which have since progressed to include significant shortness of breath, especially during exertion. She describes the chest pain as sharp and intermittent, worsening with deep inspiration or coughing. The patient denies any recent travel, sick contacts, or known allergies. Her past medical history is significant for well-controlled hypertension and a 15-pack-year smoking history that ceased 10 years ago.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears mildly distressed but is in stable condition. Vital signs are within normal limits except for oxygen saturation on room air at 92%. Auscultation of the lungs reveals bilateral wheezing and decreased breath sounds in the lower lobes. Cardiovascular examination shows regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and bowel sounds are present. Extremities show no edema, and peripheral pulses are equal and strong bilaterally. Neurological examination is unremarkable.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Based on the patient's history, physical examination findings, and consideration of her smoking history, the working diagnosis is acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Further investigations, including chest X-ray and spirometry, are recommended to confirm this diagnosis and assess the severity.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be initiated on a short course of oral corticosteroids (prednisolone 40mg daily) and bronchodilators (salbutamol inhaler as needed for symptom relief). She will also receive education on proper inhaler technique and the importance of smoking cessation. A referral to a pulmonologist for further management and follow-up is recommended.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient should return for a follow-up appointment in one week or sooner if symptoms worsen. She will also need to schedule spirometry testing and a chest X-ray as outlined above. Additionally, she will be encouraged to seek support for smoking cessation programs available at our clinic.
