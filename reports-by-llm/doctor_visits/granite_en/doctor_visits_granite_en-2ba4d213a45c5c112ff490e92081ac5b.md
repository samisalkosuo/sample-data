Clinic or Hospital Location: Kustavi  

Patient Gender: Female  
Patient Age: 102  

Severity Level: 3 (Urgent – stable, needs 2+ resources)

Chief Complaint: The patient, a 102-year-old female, presents with progressive dyspnea and generalized fatigue over the past week. She reports a dry cough and intermittent chest pain, exacerbated by minimal exertion.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient describes a gradual onset of shortness of breath at rest, which has worsened over the past week. She denies any recent fevers, chills, or night sweats but mentions occasional mild chest tightness and a dry, hacking cough. Her current activity level is significantly reduced due to these symptoms.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears alert and oriented to person, place, and time. Vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 130/80 mmHg, heart rate 92 bpm, respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation 90% on room air, and temperature 98.4°F. Lungs reveal bilateral basal crackles, and cardiovascular examination shows regular rhythm but mild tachycardia with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and normoactive bowel sounds. Extremities show mild peripheral edema up to the knees.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's age, progressive dyspnea, and recent onset of chest pain, crackles, and tachycardia, a likely diagnosis is congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation, possibly secondary to atrial fibrillation. Further workup including EKG and echocardiogram is recommended for confirmation and assessment of severity.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be initiated on intravenous furosemide 20mg for diuresis, oral lisinopril 5mg daily for long-term management, and oral digoxin 0.125mg daily as needed for rate control if atrial fibrillation is confirmed. She will also receive supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula to maintain oxygen saturation above 92%. Close monitoring of response to treatment and vital signs is advised.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient should return for a follow-up appointment in one week for reassessment of symptoms, review of medications, and possible adjustment based on response. She will also require close monitoring by her primary care provider or cardiologist as needed between visits.
