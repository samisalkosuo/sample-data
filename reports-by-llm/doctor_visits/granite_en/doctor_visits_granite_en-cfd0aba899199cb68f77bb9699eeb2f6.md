Clinic or Hospital Location: Uurainen  

Patient Gender: Female  
Patient Age: 50  

Severity Level: 2 (Emergent – potential life threat)

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with acute onset of severe abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. She reports feeling unwell for the past 6 hours following a large meal.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient describes the current episode as the most severe she has experienced. The pain is constant, localized to the epigastric region, and rated at 8/10 in intensity. It radiates to her back and is associated with aggravation by movement or deep breaths. She denies any fever, chills, or diarrhea but mentions mild bilious ejection on vomiting three times since the onset. There are no urinary symptoms, and she has not noticed any blood in her stool.

Physical Examination Findings: The patient appears anxious and guards her abdomen upon palpation. Tenderness is present in the epigastric region with rebound tenderness. Auscultation reveals normal bowel sounds. There are no signs of peritoneal irritation or guarding. Vital signs: Blood pressure 130/85 mmHg, heart rate 95 bpm, respiratory rate 18 breaths/min, temperature 36.8°C (98.24°F), and oxygen saturation 98% on room air.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's presentation of acute epigastric pain with associated nausea, vomiting, and rebound tenderness, a differential diagnosis includes acute pancreatitis, cholecystitis, or gastric ulcer perforation. Further investigations are warranted to rule out these conditions.

Plan / Treatment:  

1. Admit the patient for further evaluation and management.  
2. Order laboratory tests including serum amylase, lipase, complete blood count, and urinalysis.  
3. Obtain an abdominal CT scan with contrast to assess for any organ damage or complications.  
4. Administer intravenous fluids for hydration and pain management with meperidine 50mg every 4-6 hours as needed.  
5. Initiate nil per os (NPO) status until further evaluation.  

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the hospital setting. Depending on the results of investigations, she may require consultation with a gastroenterologist or surgeon for definitive management. Follow-up appointment will be scheduled once discharged, contingent upon the diagnosis and treatment plan.
