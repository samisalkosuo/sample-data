Visit Date: 17.10.2023  
Clinic or Hospital Location: Salla  

Patient Gender: Female  
Patient Age: 34  

Severity Level: 3 (Urgent – stable, needs 2+ resources)

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with a 3-day history of progressive lower abdominal pain, fever, and dysuria. She reports experiencing frequent, painful urination and lower back discomfort.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient is a 34-year-old female who first noticed mild lower abdominal discomfort two days ago, which has since escalated to severe, constant pain. She reports fever up to 38.5°C and increased frequency, urgency, and pain during urination. Additionally, she describes lower back pain radiating to her groin area. She denies any vaginal discharge or abnormal vaginal bleeding.

Physical Examination Findings: On examination, the patient appears well-groomed but visibly uncomfortable. Her vital signs are within normal limits except for a temperature of 38.2°C. Abdominal examination reveals tenderness in the lower quadrants with guarding and rebound tenderness, suggesting possible appendicitis or urinary tract infection (UTI). No costovertebral angle tenderness is noted. Digital rectal examination is unremarkable without gross bleeding.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's presentation of lower abdominal pain, fever, and dysuria with physical findings suggestive of peritoneal irritation, a working diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis or, less likely, appendicitis is made. Further investigations are required to differentiate between these conditions.

Plan / Treatment:
1. Order urine culture and sensitivity.
2. Administer intravenous fluids for hydration.
3. Prescribe empirically intravenous ceftriaxone 250mg and methenamine mandelate 375mg every 8 hours for suspected acute pyelonephritis.
4. Arrange ultrasound of the abdomen and pelvis to evaluate for any complications or alternative diagnoses.
5. Advise patient to rest and avoid strenuous activity until further evaluation is complete.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient should return in 48 hours for a follow-up visit to review her urine culture results, assess symptom resolution, and re-evaluate her condition based on the ultrasound findings. If there is no improvement or if symptoms worsen before this appointment, she should seek immediate medical attention.
