Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient is a 1-year-old male brought in by his parents for evaluation of persistent high fever and difficulty breathing.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient's mother reports that the child has been experiencing a high fever (up to 40°C) for the past 3 days, along with increased respiratory effort and intermittent rapid breathing (tachypnea). The symptoms began after exposure to a family member with a confirmed upper respiratory tract infection. The child has also shown decreased appetite and some irritability.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient is alert but febrile (temperature 40°C rectally). He appears mildly distressed with intermittent use of accessory muscles during respiration. Auscultation reveals bilateral basal crackles and decreased breath sounds in the left lower lung lobe. The oxygen saturation is 92% on room air, and heart rate is 160 beats per minute with a blood pressure of 85/50 mmHg.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Based on the clinical presentation, history, and physical examination findings, the patient likely has pneumonia secondary to a viral upper respiratory tract infection. The high fever, tachypnea, and abnormal lung sounds are concerning for bacterial superinfection.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be started on intravenous fluids for hydration and is scheduled for a chest X-ray to confirm the diagnosis and assess the extent of pneumonia. Empiric antibiotics (Ceftriaxone) will be initiated, pending culture results. The child will also receive acetaminophen for fever reduction and comfort.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will require close monitoring in the hospital for at least 24 hours to ensure clinical improvement and response to treatment. Parents will be educated on signs of worsening respiratory status, such as increased work of breathing or decreased oxygen saturation. A follow-up appointment will be scheduled with a pediatrician in 1 week for further evaluation and management.
