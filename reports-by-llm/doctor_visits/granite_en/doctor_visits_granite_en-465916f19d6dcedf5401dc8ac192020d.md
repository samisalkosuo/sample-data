Visit Date: 09.10.2023  
Clinic or Hospital Location: Kärkölä  

Patient Gender: Female  
Patient Age: 64  

Severity Level: 5 (Non-urgent – minor complaints)

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with a persistent cough and mild shortness of breath for the past two weeks. She also reports occasional wheezing, especially at night.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The 64-year-old female patient reports the onset of her symptoms approximately two weeks ago. She describes a dry, hacking cough that is worse in the morning and at night. Occasionally, she experiences mild wheezing, which she describes as a whistling sound during breathing. She denies any fever, chest pain, or recent travel. Her only known allergy is to penicillin.

Physical Examination Findings: On examination, the patient appears in no acute distress. Vital signs are within normal limits. Auscultation of the lungs reveals decreased breath sounds bilaterally with occasional wheezing heard throughout. Cardiovascular and abdominal exams are unremarkable.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Based on the patient's history and physical examination, she is diagnosed with a likely case of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation. The patient has a history of smoking (quit 15 years ago) and long-standing asthma, which are contributing factors to her current symptoms.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be started on a short course of a bronchodilator inhaler (e.g., albuterol) as needed for acute symptoms. She will also receive instructions on proper inhaler technique and the importance of regular use of her existing maintenance inhaler (if prescribed). The patient is advised to avoid known triggers, such as cold air and cigarette smoke. A referral to a pulmonologist for further evaluation and management is recommended.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient should follow up in two weeks or sooner if symptoms worsen. She will be provided with a follow-up appointment slip and contact information for the clinic's after-hours services. Additionally, she will receive instructions on how to monitor her oxygen saturation levels at home using a pulse oximeter, which she can purchase over-the-counter if needed.
