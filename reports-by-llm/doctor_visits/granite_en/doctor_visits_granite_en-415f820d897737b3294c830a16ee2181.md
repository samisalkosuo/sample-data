Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with acute abdominal pain and distension.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 32-year-old female, reports experiencing severe epigastric abdominal pain for the past 6 hours. She describes the pain as constant, sharp, and rated at 8/10 in intensity. The pain radiates to her back and is associated with nausea but no vomiting or diarrhea. She also reports a distended abdomen and decreased urine output. The symptoms began suddenly without any precipitating factors.

Physical Examination Findings: On examination, the patient appears moderately distressed. Her vital signs are as follows: temperature 98.6°F (37°C), blood pressure 120/80 mmHg, heart rate 90 bpm, respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 98% on room air. Abdominal examination reveals guarding, rebound tenderness, and positive pouch of Tonnel test, indicating peritoneal irritation. Bowel sounds are hyperactive but present. There is no costovertebral angle tenderness or rebound.

Assessment / Diagnosis: The patient's presentation is suggestive of acute appendicitis with possible perforation, given the severity and character of her abdominal pain, guarding, and rebound tenderness.

Plan / Treatment: The patient requires immediate surgical consultation for potential appendectomy. She will be admitted to the hospital for further management, including intravenous fluids, antibiotics, and pain control with morphine as needed. A CT scan of the abdomen with contrast is recommended to confirm the diagnosis and assess for any complications such as peritonitis or abscess formation.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be followed up postoperatively in the surgical clinic for suture removal and wound care. She should also schedule a follow-up appointment with her primary care provider within 10-14 days after discharge to monitor recovery and address any concerns.
