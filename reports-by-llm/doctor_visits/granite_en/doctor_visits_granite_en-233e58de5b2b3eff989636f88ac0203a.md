### Visit Summary

**Chief Complaint:**
The patient presents with progressive dyspnea and lower extremity edema of one-week duration.

**History of Present Illness (HPI):**
A 68-year-old female reports a one-week history of worsening shortness of breath (dyspnea) at rest and orthopnea, along with noticeable swelling in her lower extremities (edema). She denies any chest pain, cough, or fever. The symptoms began gradually and have been slowly worsening since their onset. She has a history of hypertension and atrial fibrillation, for which she takes warfarin and metoprolol, respectively.

**Physical Examination Findings:**
Vital signs: Blood pressure 160/90 mmHg, heart rate 95 bpm, respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation 88% on room air. She appears mildly distressed and diaphoretic. Jugular venous pressure is elevated, with bibasilar crackles audible on lung auscultation. Lower extremities show 2+ pitting edema up to the knees. There are no lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) signs.

**Assessment / Diagnosis:**
Given the patient's age, history of cardiovascular diseases, and current symptoms of dyspnea, orthopnea, and lower extremity edema, along with physical examination findings suggestive of congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation, it is likely she has acute decompensated heart failure. Further evaluation, including an electrocardiogram (ECG) and possible echocardiography, would be beneficial to confirm the diagnosis and assess cardiac function.

**Plan / Treatment:**
1. Initiate loop diuretics (e.g., furosemide 40 mg PO q12h) for management of fluid overload.
2. Adjust antihypertensive medications as needed, considering the current presentation and potential for hypotension with diuresis.
3. Schedule an echocardiogram to evaluate cardiac function and structure.
4. Refer to a cardiologist for further management and follow-up.
5. Advise patient to restrict fluid intake and monitor daily weights.
6. Prescribe short-term oxygen therapy if needed for dyspnea relief (e.g., 2 L/min via nasal cannula).

**Follow-up Instructions:**
The patient is scheduled for a follow-up appointment in one week to reassess symptoms, response to treatment, and cardiac function following the echocardiogram. In the interim, she should contact the clinic immediately if her condition worsens or if she experiences new or severe symptoms (e.g., sudden shortness of breath, chest pain, or syncope).
