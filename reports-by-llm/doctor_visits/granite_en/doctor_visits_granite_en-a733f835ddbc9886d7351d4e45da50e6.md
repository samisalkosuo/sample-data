Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with a 48-hour history of progressive shortness of breath and chest discomfort.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 51-year-old male, reports the onset of symptoms approximately two days ago. He describes a gradual worsening of dyspnea, now rating his breathlessness as a 7 out of 10 at rest. He also reports a vague, non-pleuritic chest pain that is exacerbated by deep inspiration and relieved by sitting upright. There are no associated cough, fever, or hemoptysis. The patient denies any recent trauma, travel, or sick contacts. He has a history of hypertension and is currently on antihypertensive medication.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears mildly distressed but is in stable condition. Vital signs are as follows: Blood pressure 140/90 mmHg, heart rate 90 bpm, respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation 92% on room air, and temperature 37°C. Cardiovascular examination reveals regular rhythm but a III/VI holosystolic murmur heard best at the left sternal border. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally with no wheezes or rhonchi. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and normoactive bowels. Extremities show no edema. Neurological examination is unremarkable.

Assessment / Diagnosis: The patient's presentation raises concern for possible acute decompensated heart failure secondary to his history of hypertension and current symptoms. Further investigations are warranted to confirm this suspicion.

Plan / Treatment:
1. Order ECG to evaluate for any ischemic changes or signs of arrhythmia.
2. Obtain BNP, cardiac enzymes, and complete blood count.
3. Initiate IV furosemide 40mg and oral torsemide 5mg daily for diuresis.
4. Continue current antihypertensive regimen and consider adjustment based on investigation results.
5. Schedule echocardiogram for further assessment of cardiac function.
6. Arrange outpatient follow-up with a cardiologist within the next 72 hours.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient is advised to return for an outpatient appointment with a cardiologist in three days to review investigation results and discuss management options. He should also monitor his weight daily and report any worsening symptoms immediately.
