Clinic or Hospital Location: Enonkoski  

Patient Gender: Male  
Patient Age: 41  

Severity Level: 5 (Non-urgent â€“ minor complaints)

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with a persistent cough and mild shortness of breath for the past two weeks. He also reports occasional wheezing, especially at night.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 41-year-old male, reports the onset of a dry cough approximately two weeks ago, which has been intermittent but persistent. He describes the cough as non-productive and occasionally brings up clear sputum. The shortness of breath is mild and occurs during exertion or at night, often awakening him. He denies any chest pain, fever, chills, or recent travel. He has no known allergies and takes no regular medications.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears well-groomed and in no acute distress. Vital signs are within normal limits. Auscultation of the lungs reveals mild bilateral wheezing more prominent in the lower lobes. The rest of the physical exam is unremarkable.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Based on the patient's history and physical examination, a diagnosis of acute exacerbation of asthma is considered likely. The symptoms are consistent with mild asthmatic episodes, triggered possibly by environmental factors or viral upper respiratory infection.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be prescribed a short course of a low-dose inhaled corticosteroid (e.g., fluticasone) and a bronchodilator (e.g., albuterol) as needed for symptom relief. He will also be advised on proper inhaler technique and the importance of using a spacer device to improve drug delivery. Additionally, he is encouraged to avoid known triggers such as dust, pet dander, or smoke.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient should return for follow-up in two weeks if symptoms persist or worsen. If there's any significant change in his condition before the scheduled appointment, he should seek immediate medical attention. He will also be provided with a written action plan to manage future asthmatic episodes at home.
