Clinic or Hospital Location: Laihia  

Patient Gender: Male  
Patient Age: 94  

Severity Level: 4 (Less-urgent â€“ stable, stable, 1 resource)

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with a chief complaint of progressive dyspnea and lower extremity edema.

History of Present Illness (HPI): A 94-year-old male reports a gradual onset of shortness of breath over the past two weeks, noticeably worsening in the last few days. He describes the dyspnea as increasing with minimal exertion and occurring even at rest. Additionally, he has noticed swelling in his lower extremities, particularly in the ankles and feet, which has been progressively worsening over the past month. There is no history of chest pain, cough, or fever. He denies any recent weight changes or significant dietary modifications. His past medical history is significant for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hypertension, and atrial fibrillation on long-term anticoagulation therapy with warfarin.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears to be in mild distress due to his dyspnea. Vital signs include a blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg, heart rate of 95 bpm, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 88% on room air. He is alert and oriented to person, place, and time. Cardiovascular examination reveals a regular rhythm with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Lungs are bilaterally diffusely diminished with prolonged expiration and occasional wheezing heard throughout. Lower extremities show 2+ pitting edema up to the knees. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended with no organomegaly noted. Neurological examination is unremarkable.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's age, history of COPD, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and current symptoms of progressive dyspnea and lower extremity edema, a likely diagnosis of acute exacerbation of chronic heart failure (CHF) superimposed on his pre-existing COPD is made. This assessment is supported by the physical examination findings of elevated jugular venous pressure, crackles in lung bases, and peripheral edema.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be initiated on intravenous furosemide 40mg for diuresis to alleviate pulmonary congestion and lower extremity edema. He will also receive supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula at 2L/min to maintain oxygen saturation above 90%. His warfarin therapy will be held temporarily, and bridging with low molecular weight heparin (enoxaparin 80mg subcutaneously once daily) will be initiated. Further workup including a chest X-ray and echocardiogram is recommended to assess the severity of heart failure and guide ongoing management.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient should follow up with his primary care physician within one week for reassessment of symptoms, review of medications, and adjustment of therapy as needed. He will also be scheduled for a cardiology consultation to optimize the management of his heart failure. In the interim, he is advised to limit oral intake to small frequent meals and fluids as tolerated, and to report any worsening dyspnea or changes in symptoms immediately.
