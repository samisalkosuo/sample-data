Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient, a 5-year-old male, presents with his mother for a routine well-child checkup and concerns about his mild wheezing.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient's mother reports that he has had occasional mild wheezing for the past two weeks, primarily at night. The wheezing is not associated with any cough or fever and seems to improve with ambient air. There is no history of similar episodes in the past.

Physical Examination Findings: On examination, the patient is alert and oriented. His vital signs are within normal limits for his age. Auscultation of the lungs reveals mild bilateral whezing, more prominent on expiration, with otherwise clear lung fields. There are no other abnormal findings on systemic examination.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Based on the history and physical examination, the patient is diagnosed with occasional nighttime wheezing, likely representing mild asthma or reactive airway disease. The symptoms are not severe enough to warrant immediate intervention but should be monitored for potential progression.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be started on a short course of a low-dose inhaled corticosteroid (e.g., budesonide) twice daily, along with an albuterol rescue inhaler for acute symptoms. The mother will be instructed on proper inhaler technique and the importance of regular use as prescribed. The patient will also be scheduled for a follow-up appointment in four weeks to reassess his condition.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient is advised to return in four weeks for a follow-up visit to evaluate his response to treatment and address any ongoing concerns. In the interim, the mother should monitor her son's symptoms closely, noting the frequency, severity, and triggers of wheezing episodes. She should contact the clinic immediately if there are any significant changes in his condition or if the symptoms worsen.
