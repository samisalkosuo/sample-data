Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient, an 8-year-old male, presents with acute respiratory distress and increased work of breathing.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient's mother reports that the child has been experiencing progressive worsening dyspnea over the past 12 hours. Initially, the symptoms started with nasal congestion and a non-productive cough. Within the last 6 hours, the child developed increased respiratory rate (60 breaths per minute), retractions, and intermittent use of accessory muscles. The patient's oxygen saturation on room air is 88% as measured by pulse oximetry.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the child appears anxious and in moderate respiratory distress. Vital signs are as follows: Temperature 98.6°F (37°C), Heart rate 140 bpm, Respiratory rate 62 breaths per minute, Blood pressure 95/58 mmHg, and Oxygen saturation 88% on room air. Auscultation reveals bilateral wheezing and prolonged expiratory phase. Cardiovascular examination shows tachycardia with no murmurs. Lungs are hyperinflated with decreased tactile fremitus. No other significant findings on abdominal or neurological examinations.

Assessment / Diagnosis: The patient's presentation is consistent with an acute asthma exacerbation, likely secondary to viral upper respiratory infection.

Plan / Treatment: The child will receive immediate treatment for the acute asthma exacerbation, including:
1. Albuterol (nebulized 2.5 mg)
2. Systemic corticosteroids (oral prednisolone 0.6 mg/kg in divided doses for 3 days)
3. Intravenous fluids for hydration
4. Continuous cardiorespiratory monitoring

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be scheduled for a follow-up appointment within 1 week to reassess symptoms and adjust treatment as needed. The mother should contact the clinic immediately if there is any worsening of respiratory distress or failure to improve within 24 hours. Additionally, she should ensure the child receives all prescribed medications as directed and monitor for potential side effects.
