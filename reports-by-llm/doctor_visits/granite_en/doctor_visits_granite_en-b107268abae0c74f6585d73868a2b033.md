Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with acute onset of severe chest pain, shortness of breath, and diaphoresis.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 28-year-old male, reports the sudden onset of intense, crushing chest pain radiating to his left arm, accompanied by dyspnea and profuse sweating, which began approximately one hour ago while at rest. He denies any preceding exertion or emotional stress. He has no significant past medical history but is a non-smoker.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears anxious and diaphoretic. His vital signs are notable for a blood pressure of 100/60 mmHg, heart rate of 120 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 90% on room air, and temperature of 37°C. Cardiovascular examination reveals poor peripheral perfusion, hypotension, and a regular tachycardia with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Pulmonary examination shows bilateral basal crackles.

Assessment / Diagnosis: The patient's presentation is concerning for an acute coronary syndrome, likely an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). This diagnosis is supported by the typical triad of symptoms and physical examination findings.

Plan / Treatment: Immediate activation of the cardiac catheterization lab for emergent angiography and potential percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is recommended. The patient will receive aspirin 325 mg, a loading dose of ticagrelor 180 mg, and heparin for systemic anticoagulation. Continuous ECG monitoring and intravenous access are established.

Follow-up Instructions: Following successful revascularization, the patient will require close cardiac monitoring in an intensive care setting for at least 24 hours. He will be transitioned to dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin and a P2Y12 inhibitor) for at least six months, along with statin therapy for secondary prevention. The patient should follow up with a cardiologist within one week for further management and long-term planning.
