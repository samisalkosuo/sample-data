Clinic or Hospital Location: Sodankylä  

Patient Gender: Male  
Patient Age: 35  

Severity Level: 2 (Emergent – potential life threat)

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with acute onset of severe chest pain, shortness of breath, and diaphoresis.

History of Present Illness (HPI):  
The patient, a 35-year-old male, reports the sudden onset of intense, crushing chest pain radiating to his left arm, accompanied by shortness of breath and profuse sweating, which began approximately one hour ago while at rest. He denies any preceding exertion or known history of cardiovascular disease.

Physical Examination Findings:  
Vital signs reveal a blood pressure of 100/60 mmHg, heart rate of 120 bpm, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 88% on room air. The patient appears anxious and diaphoretic. Cardiovascular examination shows poor heart sounds with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Lungs are bilaterally clear to auscultation with tachypnea. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended. Extremities show no edema, but capillary refill is prolonged at 4 seconds. Neurological examination is unremarkable.

Assessment / Diagnosis:  
The patient's presentation is highly suggestive of an acute coronary syndrome (ACS), likely an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Urgent cardiac catheterization and potential percutaneous coronary intervention are indicated.

Plan / Treatment:  
1. Immediate ECG performed, confirming STEMI.
2. Administer aspirin 300 mg orally.
3. Initiate intravenous heparin for systemic anticoagulation.
4. Prepare for urgent cardiac catheterization and possible percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).
5. Consult cardiology for further management.
6. Monitor continuously with cardiac telemetry.
7. Administer oxygen via non-rebreather mask to maintain oxygen saturation above 92%.
8. Administer morphine sulfate 2 mg intravenously for pain control and potential afterload reduction.

Follow-up Instructions:  
The patient will be closely monitored in the cardiac care unit post-procedure. Further follow-up will be determined based on the outcome of the cardiac catheterization and PCI, if performed. The patient should contact his primary care physician for ongoing management once discharged from the hospital.
