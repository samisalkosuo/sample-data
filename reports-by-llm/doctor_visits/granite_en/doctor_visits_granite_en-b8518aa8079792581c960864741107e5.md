Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient, a 95-year-old male, presents with sudden onset of severe chest pain and shortness of breath at rest.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient reports experiencing the onset of sharp, crushing chest pain radiating to his left arm approximately 30 minutes prior to arrival. He describes the discomfort as the worst he has ever experienced and rated it as a 10 out of 10 in severity. Accompanying symptoms include diaphoresis, nausea, and anxiety. The patient has no known history of coronary artery disease but reports a remote history of smoking (quit 50 years ago) and hypertension well-controlled on medication.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient is in severe distress, diaphoretic, and pale. Blood pressure is 80/50 mmHg, heart rate is 120 beats per minute and irregular, respiratory rate is 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 88% on room air. Auscultation reveals poor air entry with crackles in the left lower lung fields. ECG shows ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, and aVF, suggestive of an acute inferior myocardial infarction (STEMI).

Assessment / Diagnosis: The patient is experiencing an acute inferior myocardial infarction (STEMI), a cardiac emergency requiring immediate intervention.

Plan / Treatment: Immediate activation of the cardiac catheterization lab for emergent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stenting is recommended. The patient will receive aspirin 325 mg, nitroglycerin 0.4 mg sublingually every 5 minutes as needed, and morphine 2 mg intravenously for pain control. He will also receive a loading dose of heparin 100 units/kg intravenously and continue on a heparin infusion to maintain an activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) of 1.5-2.5 times the control value.

Follow-up Instructions: Following successful PCI, the patient will be transferred to a cardiac care unit for continuous monitoring. Subsequent follow-up will be arranged with a cardiologist for further management, including dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin and a P2Y12 inhibitor), statin therapy, and potential referral for cardiac rehabilitation. The patient's primary care provider will be notified of the admission and treatment plan.
