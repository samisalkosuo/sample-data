Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient, a 14-year-old male, presents with a 3-day history of progressive difficulty breathing and increasing chest pain.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient reports that his symptoms began 3 days ago with mild shortness of breath, which has since worsened. He describes the current discomfort as severe, intermittent chest pain radiating to his left arm, associated with diaphoresis and a cough producing clear sputum. There is no history of fever, recent trauma, or similar episodes.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears anxious and in moderate distress. Vital signs reveal a temperature of 37Â°C, blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg, heart rate of 110 bpm, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on room air. Auscultation of the lungs reveals bilateral wheezing and decreased breath sounds in the lower lobes. Cardiovascular examination shows tachycardia with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. The abdomen is soft, non-tender, and normoactive bowel sounds are heard. Extremities show no edema, and peripheral pulses are equal and strong bilaterally. Neurological examination is unremarkable.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Based on the patient's presentation, history, and physical examination findings, the working diagnosis is an acute exacerbation of asthma with possible pneumonia. Further investigations, including a chest X-ray and blood tests, are recommended to confirm this assessment.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be administered a nebulized bronchodilator (albuterol 2.5 mg) and oral corticosteroid (prednisone 40 mg) for immediate symptom relief. Intravenous fluids will be initiated to maintain hydration. A chest X-ray will be ordered, along with complete blood count, electrolytes, and inflammatory markers. The patient will be closely monitored in the observation unit until his condition stabilizes.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient should return for a follow-up appointment within 48 hours to reassess his symptoms and review the results of further investigations. If symptoms worsen or do not improve, he should seek immediate medical attention. Additionally, the family will be provided with an asthma action plan and instructions on proper medication usage for future episodes.
