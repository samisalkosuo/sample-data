Patient Gender: Male  
Patient Age: 20

**Chief Complaint:** The patient presents with a persistent cough, fever, and dyspnea of one-week duration. He reports feeling progressively worse over the past few days.

**History of Present Illness (HPI):** The patient is a 20-year-old male who started experiencing a dry cough approximately one week ago. Initially, he attributed it to seasonal allergies but noted that his symptoms worsened with fever up to 102째F (38.9째C) and shortness of breath (dyspnea) on exertion. He denies any chest pain, sore throat, or nasal congestion. He has no known history of respiratory illnesses but mentions occasional exposure to secondhand smoke.

**Physical Examination Findings:** On presentation, the patient appears mildly distressed and is in moderate respiratory distress with a respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation of 94% on room air. Auscultation reveals bilateral basal crackles. His temperature is 101.5째F (38.6째C), pulse is 110 bpm, and blood pressure is 120/80 mmHg. There are no other significant findings on head, neck, or extremities examination.

**Assessment / Diagnosis:** Given the patient's age, persistent cough, fever, dyspnea, and bilateral basal crackles, a working diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is made. Further investigations including chest X-ray and blood tests are recommended to confirm this suspicion.

**Plan / Treatment:** The patient will be started on intravenous ceftriaxone 2g once daily and azithromycin 500mg once daily for the treatment of suspected community-acquired pneumonia. He will also receive supplemental oxygen as needed to maintain oxygen saturation above 92%. Pain management with acetaminophen 650mg every 6 hours as needed is recommended. A sputum sample will be collected for culture and sensitivity testing.

**Follow-up Instructions:** The patient should return for a follow-up appointment in one week to reassess his condition, review laboratory results, and possibly adjust treatment if necessary. He must also contact the clinic immediately if his symptoms worsen or he develops new complications such as confusion, rapid breathing, or bluish discoloration of lips/nails.
