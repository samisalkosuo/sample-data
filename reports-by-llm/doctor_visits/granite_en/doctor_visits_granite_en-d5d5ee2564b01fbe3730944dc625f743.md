Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with a persistent cough and mild shortness of breath for the past two weeks. He reports occasional wheezing and increased symptoms at night.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 36-year-old male, reports the onset of a persistent cough approximately two weeks ago. He describes it as dry and non-productive, with occasional mild wheezing. Symptoms worsen at night, causing him to awaken and experience shortness of breath. He denies fever, chest pain, hemoptysis, or recent weight loss. There is no known exposure to tuberculosis or other infectious agents.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears well-groomed and in moderate distress due to his symptoms. Vital signs are within normal limits. Auscultation of the lungs reveals bilateral wheezing, more prominent in the lower lobes. The remainder of the physical examination is unremarkable.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Based on the patient's history and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of acute exacerbation of mild asthma is made. The patient's symptoms are consistent with this diagnosis, and there are no signs of a more severe respiratory condition.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be started on a short course of a low-dose inhaled corticosteroid (e.g., fluticasone 100 mcg bid) along with a quick-relief albuterol inhaler for immediate symptom relief as needed. He will also be advised to avoid known asthma triggers and use a peak flow meter at home to monitor his lung function. A follow-up appointment is scheduled in two weeks for reassessment.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient should return in two weeks for a follow-up visit to assess symptom improvement and adjust treatment as needed. He will also be instructed on proper inhaler technique, peak flow zone interpretation, and the importance of an asthma action plan. Additionally, he is advised to avoid known triggers such as smoke, dust, and cold air, and to maintain a healthy lifestyle with regular exercise and a balanced diet.
