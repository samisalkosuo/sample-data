Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with a persistent cough and mild shortness of breath for the past two weeks. She reports occasional wheezing and increased symptoms in the evenings.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 57-year-old female, reports the onset of a persistent cough approximately two weeks ago. She describes it as a dry, non-productive cough that worsens in the evenings and is occasionally accompanied by mild wheezing. She denies any fever, chest pain, or hemoptysis. Her symptoms have been gradually progressive and have caused some discomfort during daily activities. She has no known history of respiratory diseases but mentions occasional allergic reactions to dust and pollen.

Physical Examination Findings: On examination, the patient appears well-nourished and in moderate distress due to her symptoms. Her vital signs are within normal limits. Auscultation of the lungs reveals bilateral wheezing, more prominent in the lower lobes. The rest of the physical examination is unremarkable.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Based on the patient's history and physical examination findings, she is diagnosed with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The symptoms are consistent with a mild to moderate exacerbation, as evidenced by increased shortness of breath, wheezing, and occasional nocturnal symptoms.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be started on a short course of oral corticosteroids (prednisolone 20mg daily for five days) to help reduce airway inflammation. She will also receive a bronchodilator inhaler (salbutamol as needed) to alleviate acute symptoms. Additionally, she is advised to avoid known triggers (dust and pollen) and use a spacer device with her inhaler for better drug delivery.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient should follow up in one week or sooner if symptoms worsen. She will be reassessed at that time, and the treatment plan may be adjusted based on her response to therapy. If symptoms persist or worsen before the scheduled follow-up, she should seek immediate medical attention.
