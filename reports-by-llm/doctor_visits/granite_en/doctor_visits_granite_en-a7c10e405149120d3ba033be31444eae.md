Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with a 4-day history of progressive shortness of breath and chest pain. He reports feeling increasingly fatigued and experiencing mild fever.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 28-year-old male, reports the onset of symptoms approximately four days ago. Initially, he experienced intermittent chest discomfort, which has since become constant and associated with shortness of breath at rest and exertion. He describes the pain as a dull, aching sensation in the center of his chest, rated 7/10 at its worst. Additionally, he has had low-grade fevers (up to 38°C) and subjective fatige. He denies any cough, hemoptysis, or wheezing. He has no significant past medical history but mentions occasional marijuana use.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears mildly distressed and is in moderate respiratory distress (RR 20, SpO2 92% on room air). His vital signs are as follows: BP 130/80 mmHg, HR 105 bpm, Temp 38.1°C, and Resp 20/min. Cardiovascular examination reveals regular rhythm but tachycardia, with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops audible. Lungs are bilaterally clear to auscultation. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended with no organomegaly noted. Extremities show no edema. Neurological examination is unremarkable.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's presentation of progressive shortness of breath, central chest pain, mild fever, and tachycardia, a differential diagnosis including pneumonia, pericarditis, or even a pulmonary embolism is considered. Further investigations are warranted to rule out serious conditions.

Plan / Treatment: 

1. Immediately order a chest X-ray and complete blood count (CBC) with differential.
2. Administer supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula to maintain SpO2 above 92%.
3. Initiate intravenous fluids for hydration.
4. Prescribe ibuprofen 400mg PO every 6-8 hours for pain management, as acetaminophen may be preferred in marijuana users due to potential drug interactions.
5. Admit the patient for further evaluation and monitoring given the urgency of his condition.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be contacted once the investigations are completed, typically within 24 hours. He should return to the clinic for a follow-up appointment as soon as possible, depending on the results. If symptoms worsen before this time, he should seek immediate medical attention at the nearest emergency department.
