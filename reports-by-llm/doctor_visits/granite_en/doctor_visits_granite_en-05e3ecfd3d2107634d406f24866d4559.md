Clinic or Hospital Location: Äänekoski  

Patient Gender: Female  
Patient Age: 39  

Severity Level: 4 (Less-urgent – stable, 1 resource)

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with a persistent cough and progressive shortness of breath for the past two weeks. She also reports intermittent chest pain and occasional wheezing.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 39-year-old female, reports the onset of her symptoms approximately two weeks ago. Initially, she experienced a dry cough, which has since become productive with yellowish sputum. She describes her shortness of breath as progressively worsening, particularly during physical exertion. The chest pain is described as sharp and intermittent, aggravated by deep breaths or laughing. She denies any fever, night sweats, or recent travel.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears mildly distressed but is in stable condition. Her vital signs are within normal limits. Auscultation of the lungs reveals decreased breath sounds and wheezing throughout all lung fields. Percussion note is dull, and there is bilateral basal crackles. There is no evidence of retractions or use of accessory muscles. Cardiovascular examination is unremarkable, with regular rate and rhythm, and no murmurs, rubs, or gallops noted. Abdominal examination is benign, with no tenderness or organomegaly.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Based on the patient's history and physical examination findings, she is suspected of having a lower respiratory tract infection, possibly pneumonia, complicated by underlying asthma exacerbation. Further diagnostic testing, including chest X-ray and possibly sputum culture, will be necessary to confirm this diagnosis.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be prescribed a course of oral antibiotics (Amoxicillin-Clavulanate 625mg PO tid for 7 days) targeting common respiratory pathogens and an inhaled short-acting bronchodilator (Albuterol inhaler as needed for symptom relief). She will also be advised to increase her fluid intake and use a humidifier at home. A follow-up appointment is scheduled in one week for reassessment, and she will be instructed to seek immediate medical attention if her condition worsens before then.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient should return for a follow-up visit in one week to assess symptom resolution and response to treatment. If there is no improvement or if symptoms worsen prior to the scheduled appointment, she must seek immediate medical attention. She will also be advised to contact the clinic if she develops fever, increased dyspnea, or hemoptysis before her follow-up.
