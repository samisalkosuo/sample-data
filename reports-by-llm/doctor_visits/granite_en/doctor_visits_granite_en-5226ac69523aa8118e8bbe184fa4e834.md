Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with acute abdominal pain, severe cramping, and intermittent vomiting for the past 6 hours. She reports a history of ovarian cysts but this episode is more intense than previous ones.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient describes the onset of sharp, constant pain in the lower abdomen, rated as 8/10 in severity. The pain radiates to her back and is associated with intermittent nausea and vomiting. She denies any fever, chills, or vaginal bleeding. Her last menstrual period was on 20.05.2025.

Physical Examination Findings: The patient appears anxious but is in stable condition. Vital signs are within normal limits. Abdominal examination reveals guarding, rebound tenderness, and mild voluntary abdominal movement, suggesting possible acute abdominal pathology. No costovertebral angle tenderness is noted.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's presentation, a working diagnosis of acute torsion of an ovarian cyst or early-stage ectopic pregnancy is considered. Further investigations are required to confirm the diagnosis.

Plan / Treatment:
1. Order a urine pregnancy test and serum beta-hCG levels.
2. Administer intravenous fluids for hydration and pain management with meperidine 50mg IM as needed.
3. Admit the patient for further observation and diagnostic testing, including ultrasound.
4. Consult gynecology for potential surgical intervention if diagnosed with torsion or ectopic pregnancy.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be contacted regarding test results and a follow-up appointment will be scheduled based on the diagnosis and treatment plan. She is advised to seek immediate medical attention if her condition worsens before the follow-up.
