Severity Level: 2 (Emergent – potential life threat)
Patient Gender: Male
Patient Age: 47

Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with acute onset of severe chest pain, shortness of breath, and diaphoresis.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 47-year-old male, reports the sudden onset of intense, crushing chest pain radiating to his left arm, accompanied by dyspnea and profuse sweating, which began approximately one hour ago while at rest. He denies any preceding exertion or emotional stress. He has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia but is not currently on medication due to non-compliance. He reports no known allergies.

Physical Examination Findings: The patient appears anxious and diaphoretic. His vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 160/95 mmHg, heart rate 110 bpm, respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation 88% on room air, and temperature 37°C. Cardiovascular exam reveals irregular heart rhythm, hypotension upon standing, and a loud, harsh, systolic murmur heard best at the apex. Lungs are bilaterally diminished with prolonged expiration. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended. Extremities show no edema, but peripheral pulses are weakly palpable. Neurological exam is non-focal.

Assessment / Diagnosis: The patient's presentation is concerning for an acute coronary syndrome, likely unstable angina or non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). Given the severity and potential life threat, immediate cardiac workup is indicated.

Plan / Treatment:
1. Administer sublingual nitroglycerin 0.4 mg for chest pain relief.
2. Obtain an electrocardiogram (ECG) to assess for ischemic changes.
3. Draw a cardiac biomarker panel (troponin I and CK-MB) to evaluate for myocardial necrosis.
4. Initiate intravenous fluid hydration and oxygen therapy via non-rebreather mask to maintain oxygen saturation above 90%.
5. Consult cardiology for potential further management, including possible thrombolysis or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).
6. Prescribe aspirin 325 mg and consider clopidogrel or ticagrelor for antiplatelet therapy upon cardiology consultation.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient requires immediate transfer to a cardiac care unit for continuous monitoring and further management. Arrange for follow-up with his primary care physician and cardiologist within one week post-discharge to address underlying risk factors, optimize medical therapy, and discuss lifestyle modifications.
