Clinic or Hospital Location: Heinävesi  

Patient Gender: Male  
Patient Age: 66  

Severity Level: 4 (Less-urgent – stable, 1 resource)

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with progressive dyspnea and a productive cough for the past two weeks. He reports increased shortness of breath with minimal exertion and occasional wheezing.

History of Present Illness (HPI):  
The 66-year-old male patient reports the onset of his symptoms approximately two weeks ago, initially presenting as a mild, dry cough. Over the past week, his condition has worsened, with increased dyspnea and the development of greenish sputum. He denies fever, chest pain, or hemoptysis. His past medical history is significant for well-controlled hypertension and a 30-pack-year smoking history that ceased 15 years ago.

Physical Examination Findings:  
Vital signs: Blood pressure 138/82 mmHg, heart rate 96 bpm, respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation 90% on room air.  
General appearance: The patient appears mildly distressed but is in no immediate respiratory distress.  
HEENT: Normocephalic, atraumatic. Pupils equal, round, and reactive to light. Oropharynx clear.  
Cardiovascular: Regular rhythm, mild tachycardia. No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  
Lungs: Decreased breath sounds bilaterally with occasional wheezing heard throughout. Bronchial breath sounds are prominent over the lower lobes.  
Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, non-distended. No organomegaly or masses.  
Extremities: No peripheral edema or cyanosis.  

Assessment / Diagnosis:  
The patient's presentation is consistent with a moderate exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). His history of smoking, increased dyspnea, productive cough, and wheezing support this diagnosis.  

Plan / Treatment:  
1. Prescribe albuterol inhaler (2 puffs q4h prn for dyspnea) to provide bronchodilatory effects.
2. Initiate a course of oral prednisone 40mg daily for 5 days to reduce airway inflammation.
3. Schedule a follow-up appointment in one week for reassessment and potential adjustment of therapy based on symptom improvement.
4. Recommend pulmonary rehabilitation referral for smoking cessation support and exercise training.
5. Advise the patient to avoid known triggers (e.g., secondhand smoke, pollutants) and maintain good hydration.

Follow-up Instructions:  
The patient is scheduled to return in one week for a follow-up visit to reassess his respiratory status and adjust treatment as necessary. In the interim, he should continue using his prescribed medications as directed and adhere to the recommended lifestyle modifications. If symptoms worsen or new symptoms develop before the scheduled appointment, he should seek immediate medical attention.
