History of Present Illness (HPI):  
The patient is a 14-year-old male who first noticed abdominal pain around the umbilical region approximately 72 hours ago. The pain has been described as constant, moderate in intensity, and occasionally sharp. It radiates to the back and is associated with fever up to 38.5°C, non-bilious vomiting, decreased appetite, and mild diarrhea (2-3 episodes per day). He denies any blood in stool or urine, chest pain, cough, or shortness of breath. There are no recent travel history or sick contacts.

Physical Examination Findings:  
Vital signs: Blood pressure 120/80 mmHg, heart rate 90 bpm, respiratory rate 18 breaths/min, temperature 38.2°C, and oxygen saturation 98% on room air.  
General appearance: The patient appears mildly uncomfortable but is in no acute distress.

Abdomen: Mild tenderness in the epigastric region with rebound tenderness. No guarding or rigidity. Bowel sounds present and active. No organomegaly or masses palpated.  
Extremities: Warm and well-perfused without edema.  
Neurological: Alert and oriented to person, place, and time. Cranial nerves II-XII intact. Strength 5/5 in all extremities. Sensation intact. Reflexes 2+ and symmetric.

Assessment / Diagnosis:  
The patient's presentation is suggestive of acute appendicitis, given the localized abdominal pain, fever, nausea, vomiting, and decreased appetite with mild diarrhea. The physical examination findings are consistent with right lower quadrant tenderness and rebound tenderness, further supporting this diagnosis.

Plan / Treatment:  
1. Admit the patient for further evaluation and management of suspected acute appendicitis.
2. Order laboratory tests: Complete blood count (CBC), C-reactive protein (CRP), and urinalysis.
3. Obtain an abdominal/pelvic CT scan with contrast to confirm the diagnosis and assess for complications.
4. Initiate intravenous fluids for hydration and prepare for possible surgical intervention if imaging confirms appendicitis.
5. Administer pain management with intravenous acetaminophen or ibuprofen as needed.
6. Prescribe prophylactic antibiotics (ceftriaxone 2 grams IV now, followed by ceftriaxone 1 gram IV every 12 hours and metronidazole 500 mg IV every 8 hours) to prevent postoperative infection if appendectomy is performed.

Follow-up Instructions:  
The patient will be monitored closely during his hospital stay. Once the diagnosis is confirmed, a multidisciplinary team will discuss the best course of action, which may include an emergency appendectomy. Postoperatively, the patient will require close monitoring for any complications and will need to follow-up with the surgical team before discharge. He should also schedule a follow-up appointment in the clinic within 1 week post-discharge to assess healing and address any concerns.
