Clinic Location: Geta

Patient: Female, 72 years old
Severity Level: 3 (Urgent - stable, needs 2+ resources)

Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with progressive dyspnea and lower extremity edema of one-week duration.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 72-year-old female, reports a one-week history of worsening shortness of breath (dyspnea) and swelling in her lower extremities (edema). She denies any chest pain, cough, or fever. The symptoms began gradually and have been slowly worsening since their onset. She has a known history of hypertension and atrial fibrillation, for which she takes warfarin and metoprolol, respectively.

Physical Examination Findings: On examination, the patient appears her stated age and is in moderate distress due to dyspnea. Vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 150/90 mmHg, heart rate 95 bpm (irregularly irregular), respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 92% on room air. Cardiovascular examination reveals an irregularly irregular rhythm with a loud, grade III/VI holosystolic murmur best heard at the left sternal border. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. There is 2+ pitting edema in both lower extremities, more pronounced in the legs. No other significant findings on abdominal or neurological examination.

Assessment / Diagnosis: The patient's presentation of progressive dyspnea, lower extremity edema, and known history of atrial fibrillation raise concern for possible decompensated heart failure. Further evaluation with an echocardiogram and cardiac biomarkers is recommended to confirm the diagnosis.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be started on intravenous furosemide 40mg for acute management of her edema, along with oral torsemide 10mg daily upon discharge. She will also receive lisinopril 5mg daily to manage her hypertension and prevent further cardiac remodeling. The patient's warfarin therapy will be monitored closely for appropriate international normalized ratio (INR) levels.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient should follow up with her primary care physician within one week for a review of her medications and to ensure proper management of her heart failure. She should also schedule an echocardiogram as soon as possible to further evaluate her cardiac function. In the meantime, she should monitor her weight daily and report any worsening symptoms promptly.
