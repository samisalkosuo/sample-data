Clinic or Hospital Location: Kokemäki  

Patient Gender: Male  
Patient Age: 80  

Severity Level: 3 (Urgent – stable, needs 2+ resources)

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with progressive dyspnea and a productive cough for the past three days. He reports increased shortness of breath at rest and mild chest pain.

History of Present Illness (HPI): An 80-year-old male presents with a three-day history of worsening dyspnea and a productive cough with yellowish sputum. The symptoms began gradually and have progressively worsened, leading to noticeable difficulty performing activities of daily living. He denies fever, chills, or hemoptysis but reports mild chest pain exacerbated by deep breaths or coughing. He has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and is a current smoker (1 pack-year).

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears mildly distressed but is in stable condition. Vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 130/80 mmHg, heart rate 95 bpm, respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute, temperature 36.8°C, and oxygen saturation 88% on room air. Auscultation reveals bilateral basal crackles and decreased breath sounds. Cardiovascular examination shows regular rhythm with no murmurs or gallops. There is no peripheral edema noted.

Assessment / Diagnosis: The patient's presentation is consistent with an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD). His symptoms, including increased dyspnea, productive cough, and worsening oxygen saturation, suggest a possible superimposed bacterial pneumonia.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be initiated on intravenous corticosteroids (methylprednisolone 40 mg qd) and antibiotics (ceftriaxone 500 mg q12h). He will also receive bronchodilators (salbutamol nebulizer q4h prn) for symptomatic relief. Oxygen therapy via non-rebreather mask is in place to maintain oxygen saturation above 90%. A chest X-ray has been ordered to confirm the diagnosis and assess the extent of lung involvement.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be reassessed clinically within 48 hours for symptom improvement and radiographic response. If there is no significant improvement, further investigations such as sputum culture and sensitivity may be considered. He will also receive instructions on proper inhaler technique and home oxygen therapy if required post-discharge. The patient should follow up with his primary care physician within one week of discharge for ongoing management of COPD and smoking cessation counseling.
