Clinic or Hospital Location: Pyhäjoki  

Patient Gender: Female  
Patient Age: 46  

Severity Level: 3 (Urgent – stable, needs 2+ resources)

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with a persistent cough, shortness of breath, and intermittent chest pain for the past two weeks. She reports increased severity of symptoms over the last 48 hours.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient is a 46-year-old female who initially sought care for a persistent dry cough and mild fatigue, which she attributed to allergies. Over the past week, her symptoms have progressed, with increased frequency of coughing episodes, shortness of breath, and occasional sharp chest pain exacerbated by deep breaths or physical activity. She denies fever, chills, night sweats, or recent weight loss. There is no history of travel, sick contacts, or known allergies to medications.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears mildly distressed but is in stable condition. Her vital signs are within normal limits except for a respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation of 94% on room air. Auscultation reveals bilateral basal crackles, decreased breath sounds, and mild wheezing. Cardiovascular examination is unremarkable with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and bowel sounds are present. Extremities show no edema, and neurological examination is grossly intact.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's history, physical examination findings, and recent progression of symptoms, a working diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) with possible underlying asthma exacerbation is made. Further investigations including chest X-ray and blood tests are recommended to confirm this suspicion.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be started on a course of oral antibiotics (Amoxicillin-Clavulanate 625mg PO q12h for 7 days) targeting common respiratory pathogens, along with an inhaled short-acting beta-agonist (SABA) for immediate relief of bronchospasm. She will also receive a prescription for a corticosteroid (Prednisolone 40mg PO q24h for 3 days) to reduce airway inflammation. The patient is advised to use a rescue inhaler as needed and to follow up if symptoms worsen or do not improve within 72 hours of initiating treatment.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient should return for a follow-up appointment in one week to assess response to therapy and ensure resolution of symptoms. If there is no improvement, or if she experiences worsening symptoms (e.g., increased dyspnea, fever, or hemoptysis), she must seek immediate medical attention. Additionally, she should obtain a chest X-ray within the next 48 hours to confirm the diagnosis and guide further management.
