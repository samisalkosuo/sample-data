Clinic or Hospital Location: Virrat  

Severity Level: 5  
Patient Gender: Female  
Patient Age: 81

Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient, an 81-year-old female, presents with a chief complaint of progressive fatigue and mild shortness of breath over the past two weeks. She also reports occasional dizziness upon standing.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient has been experiencing gradual onset of fatigue, rating 7/10 in severity, which has been worsening over the past fortnight. She describes the fatigue as a generalized weakness that limits her ability to perform daily activities. The shortness of breath is mild, occurring with minimal exertion, and is rated as 3/10. She also mentions experiencing episodes of dizziness upon standing, which last for a few seconds and resolve with sitting. There is no chest pain, cough, or fever.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears anxious but is in no immediate distress (respiratory rate 18/min, blood pressure 130/80 mmHg, heart rate 82/min, oxygen saturation 98% on room air). Cardiovascular examination reveals regular rhythm with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended with no organomegaly. Extremities show no edema or cyanosis. Neurological examination is unremarkable except for mild postural hypotension with a drop in blood pressure of 20 mmHg upon standing.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's age, progressive fatigue, mild shortness of breath, and orthostatic dizziness, a working diagnosis of age-related anemia is considered. Further evaluation with complete blood count (CBC) and iron studies is recommended to confirm this suspicion. Other differential considerations include medication side effects, thyroid disorders, or cardiac causes; however, these are less likely given the patient's stable vital signs and lack of specific symptoms.

Plan / Treatment: 

1. Order CBC with differential and iron panel to evaluate for anemia.
2. Advise the patient to avoid sudden position changes and perform sit-to-stand exercises gradually to minimize orthostatic dizziness.
3. Encourage a balanced diet rich in iron-containing foods, such as lean meats, beans, and leafy greens.
4. Review current medications for potential side effects contributing to fatigue or dizziness.
5. Schedule follow-up in two weeks to reassess symptoms and review laboratory results.

Follow-up Instructions: Please return in two weeks for a follow-up appointment to discuss the results of your blood tests and to monitor your progress. If you experience worsening fatigue, severe dizziness, or syncope prior to this appointment, seek immediate medical attention.
