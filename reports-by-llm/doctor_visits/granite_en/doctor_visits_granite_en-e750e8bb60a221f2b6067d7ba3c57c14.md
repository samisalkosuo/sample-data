Clinic or Hospital Location: Pirkkala  

Severity Level: 5  
Patient Gender: Female  
Patient Age: 2 years old  

Chief Complaint: The patient, a 2-year-old female, presents with her mother for a routine well-child checkup.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient is a healthy 2-year-old female who has had no significant illnesses or hospitalizations. She has been meeting developmental milestones appropriately and has had a normal growth pattern. There are no concerns regarding feeding, sleep, or behavior. The mother reports that the child has had a mild cough for the past two days but is otherwise playful and in good spirits.

Physical Examination Findings: Vital signs are within normal limits for age. The patient's weight is 14.5 kg (25th percentile), height is 90 cm (50th percentile), and head circumference is 48 cm (75th percentile). HEENT exam reveals clear ear canals and tympanic membranes, a normal oropharynx, and no evidence of skin lesions. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally with occasional wheezes heard at the left lower lung bases. Cardiovascular and abdominal exams are unremarkable. Neurological exam is intact with appropriate gross motor skills, fine motor skills, language development, and social interaction.

Assessment / Diagnosis: The patient presents for a routine well-child checkup and has a mild wheeze on auscultation. No acute illness or concerning symptoms are identified.

Plan / Treatment: The child is growing appropriately according to standard growth charts, with no signs of malnutrition or failure to thrive. The mild wheeze is non-specific and may represent viral-induced respiratory distress. I will recommend saline nebulizer treatments at home for the next 3 days to help manage any potential airway congestion. Encourage hydration and increased feeding as tolerated. Advise the mother to monitor symptoms closely and return if there is worsening respiratory distress or fever development.

Follow-up Instructions: Schedule a follow-up appointment in 3 months for another well-child checkup unless any concerning symptoms develop prior to that time. Instruct the mother on recognizing signs of worsening respiratory distress and advise immediate return if observed.
