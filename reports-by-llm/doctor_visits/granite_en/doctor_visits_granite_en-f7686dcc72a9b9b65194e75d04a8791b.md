Clinic or Hospital Location: Puumala  

Patient Gender: Male  
Patient Age: 69  

Severity Level: 2 (Emergent – potential life threat)

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with acute onset of severe chest pain, shortness of breath, and diaphoresis.

History of Present Illness (HPI):  
The patient, a 69-year-old male, reports experiencing sudden onset of severe substernal chest pain radiating to the left arm, accompanied by dyspnea and profuse sweating approximately one hour ago. The pain is described as 10/10 in intensity and unrelenting. He denies any preceding exertion or similar episodes. He has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, for which he takes Lisinopril and Atorvastatin, respectively.

Physical Examination Findings:  
Vital signs: Blood pressure 160/95 mmHg, heart rate 110 bpm, respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation 88% on room air, and temperature 37°C. The patient appears diaphoretic, distressed, and in moderate discomfort. Cardiovascular exam reveals irregular heart rhythm with a possible murmur. Lungs are bilaterally diminished with prolonged expiration suggestive of pulmonary edema. Extremities show no evident edema, but peripheral pulses are weakly palpable.

Assessment / Diagnosis:  
The patient's presentation is concerning for an acute coronary syndrome, likely a ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The combination of severe chest pain, radiation to the left arm, dyspnea, and diaphoresis, along with significant elevations in blood pressure and tachycardia, suggests myocardial ischemia.

Plan / Treatment:  
1. Immediate ECG to confirm STEMI.
2. Administer aspirin 300 mg chewed, unless contraindicated.
3. Initiate sublingual nitroglycerin every 5 minutes for up to three doses, then intravenous nitroprusside as tolerated.
4. Obtain emergent cardiac catheterization for potential percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).
5. Administer high-intensity statin therapy if not already on maximum medical therapy.
6. Consult cardiology for further management and possible transfer to a PCI-capable center.

Follow-up Instructions:  
The patient requires immediate transfer to the nearest PCI-capable cardiac care unit for definitive management of suspected STEMI. Arrange transport via ambulance with continuous ECG monitoring. Advise the receiving facility of the patient's medication regimen and medical history. Follow up will occur post-procedure at the cardiac care unit, followed by a scheduled follow-up appointment in our clinic within one week of discharge for ongoing management and optimization of cardiovascular therapy.
