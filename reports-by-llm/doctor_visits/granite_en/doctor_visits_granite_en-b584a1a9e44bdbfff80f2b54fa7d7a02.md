Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with acute onset of severe abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.

History of Present Illness (HPI):  
The patient reports experiencing a sudden onset of severe epigastric pain approximately 2 hours ago, radiating to the back. The pain is described as constant, sharp, and rated at 8/10 in intensity. Associated symptoms include nausea, non-projectile vomiting, and a lack of appetite. There are no urinary or bowel symptoms. The patient denies any recent trauma, fever, or changes in bowel habits. She has no significant past medical history but is currently taking no medications.

Physical Examination Findings:  
Vital signs: Blood pressure 130/80 mmHg, heart rate 95 bpm, respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, temperature 37°C (98.6°F), and oxygen saturation 98% on room air.  
General appearance: The patient appears distressed due to pain but is cooperative.  
HEENT: Normocephalic, atraumatic. Pupils equal, round, and reactive to light. Oropharynx clear.  
Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  
Respiratory: Clear to auscultation bilaterally.  
Abdomen: Tenderness in the epigastric region with guarding and rebound tenderness. No masses or organomegaly detected. Bowel sounds present and active.  
Excision: No edema noted in the extremities.  

Assessment / Diagnosis:  
The patient's presentation is concerning for acute pancreatitis, given her severe epigastric pain, nausea, vomiting, and positive physical examination findings (tenderness, guarding, and rebound tenderness in the epigastric region). Laboratory tests, including serum amylase and lipase levels, are pending to confirm this diagnosis.

Plan / Treatment:  
1. Admit the patient for further evaluation and management of suspected acute pancreatitis.
2. Administer intravenous fluids (normal saline) for hydration and electrolyte balance.
3. Prescribe proton pump inhibitor (PPI) injection for pain relief and gastrointestinal protection.
4. Order laboratory tests: complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, serum amylase, and lipase levels.
5. Consult with a gastroenterologist for potential endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) if indicated.
6. Monitor vital signs, pain level, and fluid balance closely.
7. Provide patient education on NPO status, pain management, and anticipated recovery timeline.

Follow-up Instructions:  
Schedule a follow-up appointment in 1 week for reassessment of symptoms and review of laboratory results. If the patient's condition does not improve or worsens, she should return to the emergency department immediately.
