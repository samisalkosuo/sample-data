Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with a persistent cough and mild shortness of breath for the past two weeks. He reports occasional wheezing and increased symptoms in the morning.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 43-year-old male, reports the onset of a persistent cough approximately two weeks ago. He describes it as dry and non-productive, with occasional wheezing audible during respiratory efforts. The patient also mentions mild shortness of breath, particularly in the morning, which improves with rest. There is no history of fever, chills, or chest pain. He denies any recent travel, sick contacts, or known allergies.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears comfortable and in no acute distress. Vital signs are within normal limits. Auscultation of the lungs reveals bilateral wheezing, more prominent in the lower lobes. The remainder of the physical exam is unremarkable.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Based on the patient's history and physical examination findings, the working diagnosis is acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient's symptoms are consistent with a flare-up of his underlying condition.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be started on a short course of oral corticosteroids (prednisolone 40mg daily for five days) and a bronchodilator inhaler (salbutamol as needed). He will also receive instructions on proper inhaler technique and the importance of adherence to his maintenance medications. The patient will be advised to follow up with his primary care physician or a pulmonologist for further management and potential adjustment of long-term therapy.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient is scheduled to return for a follow-up appointment in two weeks. If symptoms worsen before this appointment, he should seek immediate medical attention. He will also be provided with a referral to a local pulmonologist for further evaluation and management of his COPD.
