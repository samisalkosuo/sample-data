Severity Level: 2 (Emergent – potential life threat)
Patient Gender: Female
Patient Age: 95

Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient, a 95-year-old female, presents with acute onset confusion and disorientation, reported by her caregiver. She has also exhibited intermittent episodes of tachycardia and mild respiratory distress over the past 24 hours.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient's caregiver reports that she has been progressively more confused since yesterday, with occasional agitation and restlessness. She has also experienced episodes of rapid heart rate (tachycardia) and shallow breathing, which have temporarily improved with oxygen therapy at home. There is no known history of similar episodes or recent changes in medication.

Physical Examination Findings: On examination, the patient appears alert but disoriented to time and place. Her vital signs are as follows: Blood pressure 130/80 mmHg, heart rate 110 bpm (tachycardia), respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation 92% on room air, and temperature 36.8°C. Cardiovascular examination reveals a regular rhythm with no murmurs or gallops. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended. Neurological examination shows a Glascow Coma Scale score of 12 (Eyes: E4, Verbal: 3, Motor: 6).

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's age, acute confusion, tachycardia, and respiratory distress, a differential diagnosis of infectious etiology (e.g., pneumonia or urinary tract infection) or metabolic derangement (e.g., electrolyte imbalance or dehydration) is considered most likely. Further investigations are warranted to identify the underlying cause.

Plan / Treatment:
1. Obtain blood tests: Complete Blood Count (CBC), Electrolytes, Renal Function Tests, and C-reactive protein (CRP).
2. Order a chest X-ray to rule out pneumonia.
3. Initiate intravenous fluid hydration for potential dehydration or electrolyte imbalance.
4. Administer supplemental oxygen as needed to maintain oxygen saturation above 92%.
5. Consult with the infectious disease specialist for possible empiric antibiotics if infection is suspected.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient's caregiver should bring her back to the clinic for a follow-up appointment within 48 hours to review the results of the investigations and discuss the management plan. If the patient's condition worsens before this time, she should seek immediate medical attention.
