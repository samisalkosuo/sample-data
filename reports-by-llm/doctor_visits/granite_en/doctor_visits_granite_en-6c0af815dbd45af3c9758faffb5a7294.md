Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with progressive dyspnea and a productive cough for the past two weeks. He reports increased shortness of breath with minimal exertion and occasional hemoptysis.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 57-year-old male, reports the onset of his symptoms approximately two weeks ago. Initially, he experienced a mild cough and intermittent chest discomfort. Over the past week, his symptoms have worsened, with increased dyspnea at rest and the development of a rust-colored sputum. He denies any recent travel, sick contacts, or known allergies. His occupational exposure includes occasional contact with dust and mild chemical fumes.

Physical Examination Findings: The patient appears mildly distressed but is in no immediate respiratory distress. Vital signs are within normal limits. Auscultation reveals bilateral basal crackles and decreased breath sounds. Cardiovascular examination is unremarkable, with regular rate and rhythm. There is no peripheral edema.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Based on the patient's history, physical examination findings, and a high pretest probability, the patient likely has community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) with possible underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation. Further diagnostic testing, including chest X-ray and blood work, is recommended to confirm the diagnosis and assess severity.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be started on a course of intravenous ceftriaxone and azithromycin for suspected CAP. Oxygen therapy will be initiated as needed based on his SpO2 levels. He will also receive inhaled bronchodilators to manage potential COPD symptoms. The patient will undergo a chest X-ray and complete blood count (CBC) with differential.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient should return for a follow-up appointment in one week to assess his response to treatment and re-evaluate his respiratory status. If his symptoms worsen or do not improve, he should seek immediate medical attention. He will also be provided with a referral to a pulmonologist for further evaluation and management of potential COPD.
