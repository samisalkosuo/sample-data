Clinic or Hospital Location: Juupajoki  

Patient Gender: Male  
Patient Age: 58  

Severity Level: 5 (Non-urgent â€“ minor complaints)

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with a persistent cough and mild shortness of breath for the past two weeks. He also reports occasional wheezing, especially at night.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient is a 58-year-old male who has been experiencing a gradual onset of a dry cough, mild dyspnea, and intermittent wheezing for approximately two weeks. He denies any recent travel, sick contacts, or known allergies. He reports no significant past medical history but mentions occasional exposure to dust while working in his garden. The symptoms have been gradually worsening, leading him to seek medical attention today.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears well-groomed and in moderate distress due to his respiratory symptoms. Vital signs are within normal limits. Auscultation of the lungs reveals decreased breath sounds bilaterally with occasional wheezing heard throughout. Cardiovascular examination is unremarkable, with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops noted. The abdomen is soft, non-tender, and bowel sounds are present. Extremities show no edema, and peripheral pulses are strong bilaterally. Neurological examination is non-contributory.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Based on the patient's history and physical examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), possibly triggered by recent gardening activities involving dust exposure.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be prescribed a short course of a bronchodilator inhaler (e.g., albuterol) to help alleviate his current symptoms. He will also receive instructions on proper inhaler technique and usage. Additionally, he is advised to avoid further exposure to dust and irritants. A follow-up appointment is scheduled in two weeks for reassessment of his condition.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient should return in two weeks for a follow-up visit to evaluate the effectiveness of the prescribed treatment and to discuss any ongoing symptoms or concerns. He is also advised to contact the clinic if his symptoms worsen before the scheduled appointment.
