Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient, a 12-year-old female, presents with a 3-day history of progressive abdominal pain, fever, and decreased appetite.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient reports a dull, constant abdominal pain localized to the lower right quadrant, rated as 7/10 in severity. The pain is worse with movement and pressure on the abdomen. She also complains of intermittent sharp pains radiating to her back. Associated symptoms include low-grade fever (up to 38°C), nausea, and mild vomiting. There is no history of diarrhea or constipation. The symptoms began 3 days ago and have gradually worsened. She has had a decrease in appetite and has not eaten much during this period.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears well-developed for her age but visibly uncomfortable. Vital signs are within normal limits except for a temperature of 37.8°C. Abdominal examination reveals tenderness in the right lower quadrant with rebound tenderness and guarding. There is no costovertebral angle tenderness or masses palpated. Bowel sounds are present but hyperactive. No organomegaly or masses are noted.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Based on the patient's history, physical examination findings, and the severity of her symptoms, a working diagnosis of appendicitis is considered. Further investigations, such as laboratory tests (complete blood count, C-reactive protein) and imaging studies (ultrasound or CT scan), are recommended to confirm this diagnosis.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be started on intravenous fluids for hydration and pain management with ibuprofen 200mg every 6-8 hours as needed. She will be admitted for further evaluation, including laboratory tests and imaging studies. If the diagnosis of appendicitis is confirmed, she may require surgical intervention (appendectomy).

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be followed up in the postoperative setting if an appendectomy is performed. Otherwise, she will be scheduled for a follow-up appointment in 1 week to ensure resolution of symptoms and review any further management plans.
