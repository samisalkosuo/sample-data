Clinic or Hospital Location: Sonkajärvi  

Patient Gender: Female  
Patient Age: 51  

Severity Level: 3 (Urgent – stable, needs 2+ resources)

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with a persistent cough, shortness of breath, and intermittent chest pain for the past two weeks. She reports increased fatigue and occasional low-grade fever.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The 51-year-old female patient reports the onset of her symptoms approximately two weeks ago. Initially, she experienced a dry cough, which has since progressed to productive coughing with yellowish sputum. She describes shortness of breath, particularly during physical exertion, and intermittent chest pain that worsens with deep inspiration or coughing. The patient also mentions experiencing fatigue and low-grade fever (up to 38°C) for the past few days. She denies any recent travel, sick contacts, or known allergies.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears fatigued but alert. Her vital signs are within normal limits except for a slightly elevated respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute and mild tachycardia at 90 beats per minute. Auscultation reveals decreased breath sounds in the right lower lung lobe with occasional crackles in the same area. Percussion elicits dullness, and there is no shift on positioning. The patient's oxygen saturation is 94% on room air. No other abnormal findings are noted on general physical examination.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Based on the history and physical examination findings, the patient likely has a lower respiratory tract infection, possibly pneumonia, given her symptoms of productive cough, chest pain, and low-grade fever. Further diagnostic testing, such as a chest X-ray or blood work, may be necessary to confirm this diagnosis and rule out other potential causes.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be prescribed a course of antibiotics (e.g., azithromycin 500mg once daily for five days) to address the likely bacterial infection. She will also receive a short-acting bronchodilator (e.g., albuterol inhaler) as needed for her dyspnea. The patient is advised to rest and increase fluid intake. She will be referred for a chest X-ray and complete blood count (CBC) to further evaluate her condition.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient should follow up in one week or sooner if symptoms worsen or do not improve. She should contact the clinic immediately if she experiences worsening dyspnea, bluish discoloration of lips or nail beds (cyanosis), or any other concerning symptoms.
