Patient Age: 47

Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with a chief complaint of acute onset chest pain and shortness of breath.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 47-year-old female, reports experiencing severe, crushing central chest pain radiating to her left arm that began approximately two hours ago while at rest. She describes the pain as constant and rated at 9/10 in severity. Accompanying symptoms include diaphoresis, nausea, and mild palpitations. The patient has no significant past medical history but is a lifelong non-smoker.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears anxious and in moderate distress. Her vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 140/90 mmHg, heart rate 110 bpm, respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation 92% on room air, and temperature 98.6°F. Cardiovascular exam reveals irregularly irregular heart rhythm with a rate of approximately 110 beats per minute, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally with tachypnea. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended with no rebound or guarding. Extremities show no edema, and peripheral pulses are intact. Neurological exam is grossly unremarkable.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's presenting symptoms, history, and physical examination findings, she is likely experiencing an acute coronary syndrome (ACS), possibly a non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). This assessment is based on the triad of chest pain, cardiac risk factors (age, gender), and abnormal vital signs.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be immediately admitted for further management. Initial workup includes an electrocardiogram (ECG), cardiac biomarkers (troponin, CK-MB), and a complete blood count. She will receive aspirin 325 mg, sublingual nitroglycerin for immediate relief of chest pain, and morphine sulfate for anxiety and pain control. Ongoing monitoring with continuous cardiac telemetry is recommended. A cardiology consultation is warranted for further evaluation and management.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be followed up by the cardiology team upon admission. She should arrange for a follow-up appointment with her primary care provider within one week of discharge to discuss long-term management and risk factor modification strategies. The patient is advised to contact her healthcare provider immediately if she experiences worsening chest pain, new or changing symptoms, or any concerns during her hospital stay.
