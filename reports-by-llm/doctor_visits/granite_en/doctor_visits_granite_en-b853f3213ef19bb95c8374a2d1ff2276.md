Patient Gender: Male  
Patient Age: 97  

Severity Level: 3 (Urgent – stable, needs 2+ resources)

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with a two-day history of progressive dyspnea and mild chest pain. He reports feeling more short of breath than usual while performing his daily activities and experiencing a dull, aching sensation in his chest.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The 97-year-old male patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hypertension, and mild cardiovascular disease. He reports no recent changes in medication or significant weight loss. His symptoms began approximately two days ago and have gradually worsened since then.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears mildly distressed but is oriented to person, place, and time. Vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 140/80 mmHg, heart rate 95 bpm, respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation 88% on room air, and temperature 98.6°F. Auscultation of the lungs reveals bilateral basal crackles. Cardiovascular examination shows regular rhythm with a grade III/VI holosystolic murmur heard best at the apex. There is no peripheral edema noted.

Assessment / Diagnosis: The patient's presentation is concerning for an acute exacerbation of COPD, likely precipitated by a possible pneumonia given his new-onset crackles and worsening dyspnea. His history of cardiovascular disease raises the possibility of congestive heart failure as well.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be initiated on supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula to maintain oxygen saturation above 90%. He will receive a course of intravenous antibiotics targeting common respiratory pathogens, along with bronchodilators and corticosteroids for the management of acute exacerbation of COPD. Further diagnostic workup including chest X-ray and blood tests (complete blood count, electrolytes, renal function, and cardiac biomarkers) will be arranged. If his condition does not improve with initial therapy, consideration will be given for non-invasive positive pressure ventilation or hospital admission for closer monitoring and management.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient is advised to follow up with his primary care physician within one week for a review of his treatment plan and further management. He should also schedule a follow-up appointment with the pulmonology team at our clinic in two weeks to assess his response to therapy and adjust his long-term COPD management plan as needed. In the meantime, he must continue using his prescribed inhalers as directed and report any worsening symptoms immediately.
