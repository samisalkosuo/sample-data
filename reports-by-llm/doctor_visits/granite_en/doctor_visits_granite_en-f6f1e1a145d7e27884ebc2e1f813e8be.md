Visit Date: 23.06.2024  
Clinic or Hospital Location: Pyhtää  

Patient Gender: Male  
Patient Age: 61  

Severity Level: 4 (Less-urgent – stable, 1 resource)

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with progressive dyspnea and a productive cough for the past two weeks. He reports increased shortness of breath with minimal exertion and occasional wheezing.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The 61-year-old male patient reports the onset of his symptoms approximately two weeks ago, initially presenting as a mild cough and intermittent chest tightness. Over the past week, his condition has worsened, with increasing dyspnea on exertion, nocturnal dyspnea, and a persistent, non-bloody productive cough. He denies any recent travel, sick contacts, or known allergies. His past medical history is significant for well-controlled hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He is a lifelong non-smoker and reports no history of respiratory diseases.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears mildly distressed but is in stable condition. Vital signs are as follows: Blood pressure 138/82 mmHg, heart rate 92 bpm, respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, temperature 37°C, and oxygen saturation 92% on room air. Auscultation reveals bilateral basal crackles and decreased breath sounds. Cardiovascular examination shows regular rhythm with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. There is no peripheral edema noted.

Assessment / Diagnosis: The patient's presentation is suggestive of an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), likely precipitated by a respiratory infection. His history of type 2 diabetes and hypertension may contribute to his increased susceptibility to infections.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be initiated on a course of oral antibiotics (Amoxicillin-Clavulanate 875mg/125mg BID) for suspected bacterial pneumonia and prescribed inhaled bronchodilators (Albuterol inhaler as needed for dyspnea). He will also receive a short course of systemic corticosteroids (Prednisone 40mg daily) to reduce airway inflammation. The patient will be advised to continue his maintenance medications, including long-acting bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids as prescribed by his primary care physician.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient is scheduled for a follow-up appointment in one week to reassess his symptoms and lung function. He should contact the clinic immediately if his condition worsens or if he develops new symptoms, such as fever, increased dyspnea, or hemoptysis. The patient will also undergo spirometry testing during this visit to monitor his respiratory status and adjust therapy accordingly.
