Severity Level: 3
Patient Gender: Male
Patient Age: 54

Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with a three-day history of progressive shortness of breath, chest pain, and intermittent coughing, particularly at night. He reports feeling increasingly fatigued and has noticed swelling in his lower extremities.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 54-year-old male, reports the onset of symptoms three days ago. He describes a gradual worsening of dyspnea, which is now present at rest and exertion. The chest pain is described as a dull, non-pleuritic ache, worsening with deep inspiration and relieved by sitting upright. He denies any history of similar episodes but mentions occasional seasonal allergies.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears mildly distressed, with a blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg, heart rate of 95 bpm, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on room air. Auscultation reveals bilateral basal crackles and decreased breath sounds. Cardiovascular examination shows regular rhythm but a III/VI holosystolic murmur heard best at the lower left sternal border. There is 2+ pitting edema in the lower extremities.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's age, symptoms of dyspnea, chest pain, and lower extremity edema, along with physical examination findings, a probable diagnosis of congestive heart failure exacerbation is made. Further evaluation with an echocardiogram and cardiac enzymes is recommended to rule out other differentials such as acute coronary syndrome.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be initiated on intravenous furosemide 40mg, oral lisinopril 10mg daily, and oral digoxin 0.25mg daily for management of congestive heart failure. He will also receive supplemental oxygen as needed to maintain oxygen saturation above 90%. Blood tests, including cardiac enzymes and basic metabolic panel, will be ordered. The patient will be referred for an echocardiogram to further evaluate his cardiac function.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient should follow up in the cardiology clinic within one week for a review of his treatment plan and echocardiogram results. He should also contact his primary care provider for ongoing management of any potential contributing factors, such as hypertension or renal dysfunction. The patient should monitor his weight daily and report any worsening symptoms or side effects immediately.
