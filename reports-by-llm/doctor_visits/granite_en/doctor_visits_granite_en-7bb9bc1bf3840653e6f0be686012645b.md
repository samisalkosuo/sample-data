Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with a persistent cough, shortness of breath, and intermittent chest pain for the past two weeks. He reports increased symptoms over the last 48 hours.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient is a 34-year-old male who has been experiencing a productive cough with yellowish sputum, progressively worsening shortness of breath at rest, and episodic sharp chest pain exacerbated by deep inspiration or coughing. He denies fever, night sweats, or hemoptysis. The symptoms began two weeks ago and have gradually worsened over the past few days, prompting his current visit.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears mildly distressed but is in stable condition. Vital signs are within normal limits. Auscultation reveals bilateral basal crackles and decreased breath sounds in the lower lobes. Percussion note is dull, and vocal resonance is diminished. There is no wheezing or retractions.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Based on the patient's history and physical examination findings, the working diagnosis is community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) with possible pleural effusion. Further diagnostic testing, including a chest X-ray and blood work, will be pursued to confirm this assessment.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will receive a course of intravenous antibiotics (Ceftriaxone 2g once daily) targeting common respiratory pathogens. He will also be started on an albuterol inhaler for bronchodilatation as needed for his shortness of breath. Supportive care, including increased fluid intake and rest, is advised. A chest X-ray and complete blood count (CBC) with differential will be ordered to confirm the diagnosis and assess disease severity.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient should return for a follow-up appointment in one week to reassess his condition and ensure symptom resolution. If there is no improvement or if new symptoms develop, he should seek immediate medical attention. He has been provided with instructions on recognizing signs of worsening pneumonia (e.g., worsening cough, increased shortness of breath, fever) and when to return for urgent care.
