30.06.2024, Hankasalmi Clinic Visit Report:

Chief Complaint: An 85-year-old male patient presents with progressive dyspnea and lower extremity edema of three days duration.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient reports a gradual worsening of shortness of breath at rest over the past week, now requiring assistance for ambulation due to lower extremity swelling and discomfort. He denies any chest pain but mentions occasional palpitations. His medical history is significant for hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and chronic atrial fibrillation on anticoagulation therapy.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears anxious and in mild distress. Vital signs are as follows: Blood pressure 160/90 mmHg, heart rate 110 bpm (atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response), respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation 88% on room air, and temperature 37Â°C. Cardiovascular examination reveals a regularly irregular rhythm, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Lungs are bilaterally diffusely crackles. Lower extremities show 2+ pitting edema up to the knees. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended with no organomegaly. Neurological examination is unremarkable.

Assessment / Diagnosis: The patient's presentation is consistent with acute decompensated heart failure secondary to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, likely exacerbated by poor medication adherence and inadequate fluid restriction.

Plan / Treatment: 

1. Immediate initiation of intravenous furosemide 40mg for diuresis.
2. Adjustment of current anticoagulation therapy (warfarin) to maintain INR between 2-3 for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation.
3. Consideration of rate control medication (e.g., beta-blocker or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker) for heart rate control and symptom relief.
4. Referral to cardiology for further management, potential transthoracic echocardiogram, and possible cardiac catheterization.
5. Prescription of oral diuretic (e.g., bumetanide) for home use upon discharge.
6. Patient education on fluid restriction, medication adherence, and follow-up appointments.

Follow-up Instructions: Schedule a cardiology consult within one week and arrange a follow-up appointment in two weeks to assess response to treatment and adjust management plan as needed. Instruct the patient to return immediately if symptoms worsen or new symptoms develop.
