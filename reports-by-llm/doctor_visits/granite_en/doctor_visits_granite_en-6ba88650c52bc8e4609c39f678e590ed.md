Chief Complaint: The patient presents with progressive shortness of breath and a persistent dry cough for the past two weeks. He also reports intermittent chest pain and occasional wheezing.

History of Present Illness (HPI):  
The 60-year-old male patient reports that his symptoms began approximately two weeks ago with a dry cough, which has since become more frequent and accompanied by mild exertional shortness of breath. He describes the chest pain as a dull, aching sensation in the left side of his chest, worsening with deep inspiration or physical activity. The patient denies any recent travel, sick contacts, or known allergies. He has a history of hypertension and is currently on antihypertensive medication.

General appearance: The patient appears mildly distressed but is in stable condition.

Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, no organomegaly.  
Extremities: No peripheral edema.  

Assessment / Diagnosis:  
The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are suggestive of a possible exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or an alternative diagnosis such as pneumonia or heart failure. Further diagnostic testing, including chest X-ray and spirometry, is recommended to confirm the diagnosis.

Plan / Treatment:  
1. Prescribe a short-acting bronchodilator (e.g., albuterol) for immediate relief of symptoms.
2. Initiate a course of oral corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone 40 mg daily) to reduce airway inflammation.
3. Schedule a chest X-ray and spirometry test for further evaluation.
4. Refer the patient to a pulmonologist for specialized management if symptoms persist or worsen.
5. Advise the patient to avoid known triggers (e.g., smoke, pollutants) and maintain proper hydration.
6. Instruct the patient to return if symptoms worsen, particularly shortness of breath at rest, increased sputum production, or fever.

Follow-up Instructions:  
The patient is scheduled for a follow-up appointment in one week. If there are any significant changes in his condition before this appointment, he should seek immediate medical attention. In the meantime, he should continue to monitor his symptoms and adhere to the prescribed treatment plan.
