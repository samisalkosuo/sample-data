Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with a 2-day history of progressive shortness of breath and chest pain.

History of Present Illness (HPI): A 17-year-old male reports developing chest discomfort and shortness of breath approximately 48 hours ago. The symptoms have been gradually worsening, with the patient describing the chest pain as a sharp, stabbing sensation, exacerbated by deep breaths or physical activity. He denies any fever, cough, or sputum production but mentions occasional palpitations. The patient has no significant past medical history and is currently taking no medications.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears anxious but is in stable condition. Vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 130/80 mmHg, heart rate 95 bpm, respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on room air. Cardiovascular examination reveals regular rhythm with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended. Extremities show no edema. Neurological examination is unremarkable.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's age, presenting symptoms, and stable vital signs, a differential diagnosis of costochondritis or pericarditis is considered. Further investigations are warranted to rule out more serious conditions such as myocarditis or pneumonia.

Plan / Treatment: 

1. Order an ECG to evaluate for any arrhythmias or ischemic changes.
2. Arrange for a chest X-ray to assess the cardiothoracic ratio and rule out pneumonia or pleural effusion.
3. Prescribe ibuprofen 400mg three times daily for potential costochondritis, with instructions to return if symptoms worsen or do not improve within 2-3 days.
4. Advise the patient to avoid strenuous activities and seek immediate medical attention if experiencing worsening symptoms, such as severe chest pain, lightheadedness, or syncope.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient is advised to return for a follow-up appointment in 48 hours or sooner if symptoms worsen or do not improve. He should also contact the clinic immediately if he experiences severe chest pain, lightheadedness, or syncope.
