Visit Date: 24.10.2023  
Clinic or Hospital Location: Pornainen  

Patient Gender: Female  
Patient Age: 61  

Severity Level: 5 (Non-urgent â€“ minor complaints)

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with a persistent cough and mild shortness of breath for the past two weeks. She also reports occasional chest tightness, which she attributes to seasonal allergies.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 61-year-old female, reports the onset of her symptoms approximately two weeks ago. She describes a persistent dry cough, worsening at night and accompanied by mild shortness of breath during physical activities. She denies any fever, chills, or chest pain. The patient mentions occasional chest tightness, which she believes is due to seasonal allergies, as she experiences similar symptoms annually. She has not tried over-the-counter medications for her symptoms.

Physical Examination Findings: On examination, the patient appears in no acute distress. Her vital signs are within normal limits. Auscultation of the lungs reveals mild bibasilar crackles. The rest of the physical exam is unremarkable.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Based on the history and physical examination, the patient's symptoms are suggestive of a possible allergic or viral-induced asthmatic exacerbation. Further evaluation with spirometry and allergy testing may be considered if symptoms persist or worsen.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be prescribed a short course of a mild-to-moderate corticosteroid (e.g., prednisone 40mg for 5 days, tapering over the next week) to help alleviate airway inflammation. She will also receive a sample-pack of an inhaled short-acting beta-agonist (e.g., albuterol) for symptomatic relief as needed. The patient is advised to avoid known allergens and consider using a saline nasal rinse to manage potential allergy symptoms.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient should follow up in two weeks if her symptoms worsen, persist, or are accompanied by fever or chest pain. If there is no improvement, she may need further evaluation for possible allergy testing and consideration of a referral to an allergist or pulmonologist. In the meantime, she should monitor her symptoms and use the prescribed medications as directed.
