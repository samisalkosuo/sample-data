Clinic or Hospital Location: Pedersören kunta  

Patient Gender: Male  
Patient Age: 27  

Severity Level: 5 (Non-urgent – minor complaints)

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with a persistent cough and mild chest discomfort for the past week. He also reports occasional low-grade fever and fatigue.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 27-year-old male, has been experiencing a dry, non-productive cough for approximately one week. The cough is worse at night and occasionally awakens him from sleep. He denies any recent respiratory infections, sick contacts, or travel history. He reports mild chest discomfort, described as a dull ache, which is not exacerbated by breathing or coughing. Additionally, he mentions occasional low-grade fever (up to 37.5°C) and general fatigue.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears well-groomed and in no acute distress. His vital signs are within normal limits: blood pressure 120/80 mmHg, heart rate 76 bpm, respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, temperature 37.1°C, and oxygen saturation 98% on room air. Lung auscultation reveals mild bibasilar crackles without wheezing or rhonchi. Cardiovascular examination is unremarkable, with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops noted. Abdominal examination is benign, and there is no costovertebral angle tenderness. Neurological examination is non-contributory.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's history and physical examination findings, a likely diagnosis of acute bronchitis or a viral upper respiratory tract infection is considered. The mild chest discomfort, dry cough, low-grade fever, and fatigue are consistent with this presentation.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be prescribed a course of a macrolide antibiotic (e.g., azithromycin 500mg on day 1, then 250mg for the next 4 days) to address potential bacterial superinfection. He will also be advised to increase fluid intake and use a humidifier at night to alleviate cough symptoms. Over-the-counter analgesics (e.g., acetaminophen or ibuprofen) can be used for pain relief if needed. The patient should rest and avoid strenuous activity until symptoms resolve.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient is advised to follow up in 7-10 days if symptoms worsen, persist, or are accompanied by high fever, shortness of breath, or chest pain. If the symptoms do not improve within this timeframe, he should contact the clinic for further evaluation.
