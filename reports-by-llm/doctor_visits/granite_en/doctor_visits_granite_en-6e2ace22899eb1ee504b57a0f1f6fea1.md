Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with a persistent, non-healing wound on the lateral aspect of his left ankle, accompanied by mild pain and swelling. He reports injuring the area approximately two weeks ago while playing soccer but did not seek immediate medical attention.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient describes a 22-year-old male who first noticed the wound after an initial minor sprain during a soccer match on June 10, 2025. He initially applied a simple bandage and continued playing, noting that the pain and swelling gradually subsided over the following days. However, the wound has shown no signs of healing since then, with some increased redness and mild discharge observed in the past few days.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient is alert and oriented. Vital signs are within normal limits. Inspection reveals a 2 cm x 3 cm non-healing wound on the lateral ankle with mild erythema, edema, and moderate discharge. There is no evidence of infection such as fever or systemic symptoms. Range of motion is within normal limits, and there is no palpable step-off or instability.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Based on the patient's history and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of chronic venous ulcer (CVU) secondary to an acute ankle sprain is made. The delayed presentation and non-healing nature suggest possible contributing factors such as poor venous return or peripheral arterial disease.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be prescribed a topical antibiotic ointment (Mupirocin 2%) to apply to the wound twice daily for one week, along with instructions on proper wound care and dressing changes. He will also be referred to a podiatrist for further evaluation and potential compression therapy or other interventions as needed. Additionally, he is advised to elevate his leg and avoid prolonged standing to promote venous return.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient should return in one week for a follow-up assessment of wound healing progress. If there is no improvement or signs of worsening (e.g., increased redness, swelling, fever), he should seek immediate medical attention.
