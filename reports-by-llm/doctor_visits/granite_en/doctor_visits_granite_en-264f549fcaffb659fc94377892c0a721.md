Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with acute abdominal pain and distension.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient is a 25-year-old female who reports the onset of severe, constant abdominal pain approximately six hours ago. She describes the pain as a sharp, cramping sensation in the lower quadrants, rated at 8/10 in intensity. The pain is associated with nausea but no vomiting or diarrhea. She also reports mild fever (38°C) and decreased appetite. There are no urinary symptoms, and she denies any recent trauma or changes in bowel habits.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears distressed but is cooperative. Her vital signs are as follows: temperature 38°C, heart rate 102 bpm, respiratory rate 18 breaths/min, blood pressure 110/70 mmHg, and oxygen saturation 98% on room air. Abdominal examination reveals guarding, rebound tenderness, and mild distension. Bowel sounds are hyperactive, and there is no rebound or flank pain. No costovertebral angle tenderness is noted. The rest of the physical examination is unremarkable.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Based on the patient's presentation, history, and physical examination findings, a working diagnosis of acute appendicitis is considered. This assessment aligns with the severity level 3 (urgent) due to the need for prompt surgical intervention to prevent complications such as perforation or peritonitis.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be referred to a surgeon for further evaluation and management, including potential imaging studies (e.g., abdominal CT scan with contrast) and surgical consultation. She will be prescribed intravenous fluids for hydration and pain management with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Blood tests, including a complete blood count and inflammatory markers, will be ordered to support the diagnosis.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient should follow up with the surgical team as soon as possible for further evaluation and management of her condition. She must return to the clinic within 48 hours post-surgery for a wound check and removal of sutures, if applicable. If she experiences worsening symptoms (e.g., increased pain, fever, or inability to tolerate oral intake) before surgical consultation, she should seek immediate medical attention.
