Clinic or Hospital Location: Haapajärvi  

Patient Gender: Male  
Patient Age: 17  

Severity Level: 3 (Urgent – stable, needs 2+ resources)

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with a persistent cough, shortness of breath, and intermittent chest pain for the past week. He reports occasional fever and fatigue.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 17-year-old male, reports the onset of symptoms approximately one week ago. Initially, he experienced a dry cough, which progressed to a productive cough with yellowish sputum. He also describes increasing shortness of breath, particularly during physical activity, and intermittent chest pain that worsens with deep inspiration. The patient has had two episodes of low-grade fever (up to 38°C) and persistent fatigue, affecting his ability to attend school regularly. He denies any recent travel, sick contacts, or known allergies.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears mildly distressed but is in stable condition. Vital signs are within normal limits except for a temperature of 37.5°C and tachypnea at 20 breaths per minute. Auscultation reveals bilateral basal crackles and decreased breath sounds in the lower lobes. Palpation of the chest elicits mild tenderness to touch over the right lower lung field. Cardiovascular examination is unremarkable, with no murmurs, gallops, or rubs noted. The abdomen is soft, non-tender, and bowel sounds are present. Neurological examination is normal.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Based on the patient's history and physical examination findings, a working diagnosis of pneumonia with possible pleural effusion is considered. Further investigations, including chest X-ray and possibly sputum culture, are recommended to confirm this diagnosis and guide treatment.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be started on a course of oral antibiotics (Amoxicillin-Clavulanate) as an empirical treatment for community-acquired pneumonia. He will also receive inhaled bronchodilators (Salbutamol) to alleviate shortness of breath and acetaminophen for fever and discomfort. The patient is advised to rest and increase fluid intake. A follow-up appointment is scheduled in one week for reassessment, depending on symptom resolution and response to treatment.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient should return to the clinic in one week for a follow-up visit to assess symptom improvement and review any necessary adjustments to the treatment plan. If symptoms worsen or new symptoms develop before the scheduled appointment, he should seek immediate medical attention.
