Patient Age: 94

Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient, a 94-year-old female, presents with acute onset confusion and disorientation, reported by her caregiver. She has also experienced a sudden decline in oral intake and increased lethargy over the past 24 hours.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient's caregiver reports that she has been progressively more confused since yesterday, with difficulty following simple commands and orienting to person, place, and time. She has also shown a significant decrease in her usual oral intake, consuming only small amounts of liquids. The patient's lethargy has increased, with minimal verbalization and reduced movement. There is no history of recent falls, head trauma, or fever.

Physical Examination Findings: On examination, the patient appears alert but disoriented to person, place, and time. Her vital signs are within normal limits, except for a mild tachycardia at 98 beats per minute. Sternosity and other focal neurological deficits are not appreciated. A bedside glucose check reveals a normal blood glucose level.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's age, acute onset confusion, altered mental status, and reduced oral intake, a differential diagnosis of delirium, urinary tract infection (UTI), or medication side effects is considered. Further evaluation is needed to rule out these possibilities.

Plan / Treatment:
1. Complete blood count (CBC) with differential, comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), and urinalysis to evaluate for infection or electrolyte imbalances.
2. Urine culture to rule out UTIs.
3. Review of current medications for potential side effects contributing to confusion.
4. Consultation with the geriatric service for further evaluation and management.
5. Close monitoring for any changes in mental status or vital signs.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the clinic for the next 24 hours. If there is no improvement or if her condition worsens, she will require hospital admission for further investigation and management. The caregiver should report any changes in the patient's mental status, vital signs, or urinary habits immediately. A follow-up appointment will be scheduled based on the results of the diagnostic tests and the patient's response to initial management.
