Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient, a 96-year-old male, presents with sudden onset of severe chest pain and shortness of breath at rest.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient reports experiencing the onset of sharp, pleuritic chest pain radiating to the left arm approximately 30 minutes prior to arrival. He describes the pain as the worst he has ever experienced, scoring 10 out of 10 in severity. Accompanying symptoms include diaphoresis, nausea, and a cold, clammy complexion. The patient's past medical history is significant for hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and a previous myocardial infarction. He takes warfarin, metoprolol, and atorvastatin.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears distressed, diaphoretic, and in moderate respiratory distress. Blood pressure is 80/50 mmHg, heart rate is 120 beats per minute and irregular, respiratory rate is 28 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation is 88% on room air, and temperature is normal at 98.6°F (37°C). Cardiovascular examination reveals hypotension, tachycardia, and a regular rhythm with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Lungs are bilaterally diminished with decreased breath sounds at the bases. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended with no organomegaly. Extremities show no edema, but peripheral pulses are difficult to palpate due to hypotension. Neurological examination is unremarkable.

Assessment / Diagnosis: The patient's presentation is highly suggestive of an acute coronary syndrome (ACS), likely an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Given the severity and the patient's history, this represents a medical emergency requiring immediate intervention.

Plan / Treatment: Immediate activation of the cardiac catheterization lab for emergent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is recommended. The patient will receive aspirin 325 mg, a loading dose of ticagrelor 180 mg, and heparin for systemic anticoagulation prior to the procedure. Continuous ECG monitoring and intravenous access are established.

Follow-up Instructions: Following successful PCI, the patient will be transferred to a cardiac care unit for close monitoring. Subsequent follow-up will be arranged with the patient's cardiologist within 48 hours of discharge. The patient should continue his current medications as prescribed and adhere to any recommended lifestyle modifications.
