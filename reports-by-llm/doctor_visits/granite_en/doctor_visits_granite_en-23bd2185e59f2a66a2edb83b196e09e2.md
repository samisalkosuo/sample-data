Visit Date: 21.01.2024  
Clinic or Hospital Location: Heinola  

Patient Gender: Female  
Patient Age: 49  

Severity Level: 4 (Less-urgent â€“ stable, stable, 1 resource)

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with a persistent cough and progressive shortness of breath for the past three weeks. She also reports intermittent chest pain and occasional wheezing.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 49-year-old female, reports the onset of her symptoms approximately three weeks ago. Initially, she experienced a dry cough and mild fatigue, which gradually progressed to include shortness of breath, especially during physical exertion. Over the past week, she has noticed increased frequency of coughing episodes, often accompanied by a slight amount of sputum production. She describes the chest pain as sharp and intermittent, worsening with deep inspiration or laughing. The patient denies any recent travel, sick contacts, or known allergies.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears well-groomed but visibly short of breath at rest. Her vital signs are within normal limits except for a respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation of 94% on room air. Auscultation reveals bilateral wheezing, more prominent in the lower lung fields. Percussion is dull to tap over the lower thoracic region, and there is decreased fremitus. No audible crackles are appreciated. Cardiovascular examination shows normal heart sounds with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and bowel sounds are present. Extremities show no edema, and neurological examination is unremarkable.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Based on the patient's history and physical examination findings, she is likely experiencing an exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The symptoms of increased cough, sputum production, worsening dyspnea, and chest pain are consistent with this diagnosis.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be started on a short course of oral prednisolone 40mg daily for five days to help reduce airway inflammation. In addition, she will receive a prescription for salbutamol inhaler (2 puffs as needed for dyspnea) to provide bronchodilatory relief. She is advised to continue using her regular long-acting bronchodilator inhaler as prescribed. The patient will also benefit from a referral to a pulmonary rehabilitation program for further management and support.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient should return for a follow-up appointment in two weeks or sooner if symptoms worsen, she develops fever, or experiences significant changes in her respiratory status. She is advised to monitor her oxygen saturation levels at home using a pulse oximeter and contact the clinic immediately if her saturations drop below 90% during rest. Additionally, she should avoid exposure to known triggers of her COPD exacerbation, such as cigarette smoke and respiratory irritants.
