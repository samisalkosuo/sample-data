Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with a three-day history of progressive shortness of breath, chest pain, and intermittent coughing, particularly at night. He reports feeling fatigued and experiencing mild fever.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 38-year-old male, reports the onset of symptoms three days ago. He describes a gradual worsening of dyspnea, particularly when lying flat, which prompted him to seek medical attention. He also reports a dull, constant chest pain that is worse with deep breaths or coughing. The patient denies any history of similar episodes but mentions occasional night sweats over the past month. He has no known drug allergies and takes no regular medications.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears mildly distressed but is oriented and in no acute distress. Vital signs are as follows: Temperature 37.8Â°C, Heart rate 102 bpm, Respiratory rate 22 breaths/min, Blood pressure 130/85 mmHg, Oxygen saturation 92% on room air. Auscultation reveals bilateral basal crackles and decreased breath sounds in the lower lobes. Palpation of the chest reveals tenderness over the right lower rib area. The patient's abdomen is soft, non-tender, and bowel sounds are present. Exposure reveals no jaundice or lymphadenopathy.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's age, symptoms of dyspnea, chest pain, and fever, along with physical examination findings such as basal crackles, decreased breath sounds, and chest wall tenderness, a working diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) with possible pleural involvement is considered. Further investigations are warranted to confirm the diagnosis and guide treatment.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be started on intravenous antibiotics (Ceftriaxone and Azithromycin) for suspected CAP, along with corticosteroids (Methylprednisolone) to address potential pleural inflammation. Oxygen therapy will be provided as needed to maintain oxygen saturation above 92%. Pain management will include Ibuprofen for chest wall pain. The patient will undergo a chest X-ray and blood tests (complete blood count, inflammatory markers, and blood cultures) to confirm the diagnosis and guide further management.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient should return for a follow-up appointment in one week to reassess symptoms and review investigations. If there is no improvement or if symptoms worsen before this time, he should seek immediate medical attention. The patient will also be advised to rest and avoid strenuous activities until symptoms improve.
