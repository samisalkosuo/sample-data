Clinic or Hospital Location: Miehikkälä  

Patient Gender: Male  
Patient Age: 41  

Severity Level: 4 (Less-urgent – stable, stable, 1 resource)

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with a persistent cough, shortness of breath, and intermittent chest pain for the past two weeks. He reports increased fatigue and occasional wheezing.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The 41-year-old male patient reports the onset of symptoms approximately two weeks ago. Initially, he experienced a dry cough, which has since become productive with yellowish sputum. He describes the chest pain as sharp and intermittent, worsening with deep breaths or physical exertion. The patient also reports unexplained weight loss of about 5 pounds over the past month and occasional night sweats. He denies fever, chills, or recent travel but mentions exposure to someone with a respiratory infection.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears fatigued but is in stable condition. Vital signs are within normal limits. Auscultation reveals decreased breath sounds in the right lower lung lobe and wheezing throughout inspiration. Percussion elicits dullness in the same region, suggesting possible consolidation. No cyanosis or clubbing is noted.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Based on the patient's history and physical examination findings, a probable diagnosis of pneumonia with underlying asthma exacerbation is suspected. Further diagnostic testing, including a chest X-ray and possibly sputum culture, will be pursued to confirm this assessment.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will receive a course of oral antibiotics (Amoxicillin-Clavulanate 875mg/125mg BID for 7 days) and an inhaled bronchodilator (Albuterol inhaler as needed for symptoms). He will also be provided with a short-acting systemic corticosteroid (Prednisone 40mg daily for 3 days) to manage the asthma exacerbation. The patient is advised to rest and increase fluid intake. Follow-up will be scheduled in one week for reassessment, pending the results of diagnostic tests.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient should return for follow-up in one week or sooner if symptoms worsen. He must complete the prescribed antibiotics and corticosteroids as directed. If he experiences increased shortness of breath, chest tightness, or any other concerning symptoms before the scheduled follow-up, he should seek immediate medical attention.
