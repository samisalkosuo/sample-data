Clinic or Hospital Location: Sastamala
Severity Level: 2 (Emergent â€“ potential life threat)
Patient Gender: Male
Patient Age: 97

Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient, a 97-year-old male, presents with acute onset confusion and disorientation, reported by his caregiver. He has also experienced a sudden decline in oral intake and increased lethargy over the past 48 hours.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient's caregiver reports that he has been progressively more confused since yesterday, with occasional episodes of agitation and disorientation. He has shown a significant decrease in his usual oral intake, consuming only small amounts of liquids. The patient's lethargy has increased, and he has been less responsive to verbal stimuli. There is no known recent head injury or fever.

Physical Examination Findings: On examination, the patient appears alert but confused, with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 12 (Eye-1, Motor-4, Verbal-3). His vital signs are within normal limits, except for a mild tachycardia at 95 beats per minute. He has no fever or neck rigidity. His pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. There are no focal neurological deficits.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's age, acute onset confusion, and recent changes in mental status, a differential diagnosis of delirium, urinary tract infection (UTI), or intracranial pathology (e.g., subdural hematoma) is considered. Further investigations are required to rule out these possibilities.

Plan / Treatment:
1. Complete blood count (CBC), comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), and urinalysis to evaluate for infection or electrolyte imbalances.
2. Non-contrast head computed tomography (CT) scan to rule out acute intracranial pathology.
3. Intravenous fluid hydration and close monitoring for any further changes in mental status.
4. Consultation with the geriatric or neurology team for further evaluation and management.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the facility for at least 24 hours, with frequent reassessment of his mental status and vital signs. The results of the investigations will guide further management. A follow-up appointment will be scheduled once the patient's condition is more stable, depending on the diagnostic findings. The caregiver should be advised to report any changes in the patient's condition promptly.
