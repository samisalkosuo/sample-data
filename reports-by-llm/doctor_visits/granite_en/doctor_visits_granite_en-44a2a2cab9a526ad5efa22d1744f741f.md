Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient, a 101-year-old female, presents for a routine follow-up appointment regarding her longstanding hypertension and osteoarthritis. She reports feeling generally well but expresses concerns about recent increased fatigue and mild shortness of breath with minimal exertion.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient has a history of well-controlled, stage 2 hypertension managed with lisinopril 10mg daily and hydrochlorothiazide 25mg daily. She also has a history of osteoarthritis, for which she takes acetaminophen as needed for mild joint pain. Over the past two weeks, she has noticed increased fatigue and mild shortness of breath with activities that were previously manageable. There is no cough, chest pain, or fever.

Physical Examination Findings: Vital signs are within normal limits. The patient appears well-nourished for her age, in no acute distress. Blood pressure is 130/80 mmHg, heart rate is 72 bpm, respiratory rate is 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Cardiovascular exam reveals a regular rhythm with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. There is mild tenderness to palpation over the knees and hands, consistent with osteoarthritis. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended with no organomegaly or masses. Extremities show mild periarticular swelling without erythema or warmth. Neurological exam is grossly intact for age.

Assessment / Diagnosis: The patient's presentation is most consistent with exertional dyspnea secondary to age-related physiologic changes and possible medication-induced hypotension contributing to her fatigue. Her osteoarthritis symptoms are well managed, with no signs of acute joint complications.

Plan / Treatment:
1. Adjust lisinopril dosage to 5mg daily and maintain hydrochlorothiazide at 25mg daily to address possible blood pressure-related fatigue.
2. Recommend a cardiology referral for further evaluation of exertional dyspnea, including potential stress testing or echocardiography if symptoms persist or worsen.
3. Continue current osteoarthritis management with acetaminophen as needed and encourage regular low-impact exercise to maintain joint mobility and strength.
4. Schedule a follow-up appointment in 6 weeks for reassessment of symptoms, blood pressure control, and medication review.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient is advised to contact the clinic if she experiences worsening fatigue, shortness of breath at rest, chest pain, or any new or unusual symptoms before her scheduled follow-up appointment in 6 weeks on [Insert Date].
