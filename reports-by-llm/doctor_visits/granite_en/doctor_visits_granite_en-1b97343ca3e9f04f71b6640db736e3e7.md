Clinic or Hospital Location: Hirvensalmi  

Patient Gender: Male  
Patient Age: 35  

Severity Level: 2 (Emergent – potential life threat)

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with acute onset of severe chest pain, shortness of breath, and diaphoresis.

History of Present Illness (HPI):  
The patient, a 35-year-old male, reports the sudden onset of intense, crushing chest pain radiating to his left arm, accompanied by shortness of breath and profuse sweating, which began approximately one hour ago while at rest. He denies any preceding exertion or known history of coronary artery disease. He has no significant past medical history but is a current smoker with a pack-year history.

Physical Examination Findings:  
Vital signs: Blood pressure 140/90 mmHg, heart rate 110 bpm, respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation 88% on room air, and temperature 37°C. The patient appears anxious and diaphoretic. Cardiovascular exam reveals irregular heart rhythm with a possible murmur. Lungs are bilaterally diminished with prolonged expiration suggestive of pulmonary edema. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended. Extremities show no evident edema.

Assessment / Diagnosis:  
The patient's presentation is concerning for an acute coronary syndrome (ACS), specifically unstable angina or possible non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The combination of atypical chest pain, shortness of breath, and sweating in a smoker with no prior history warrants immediate cardiac evaluation.

Plan / Treatment:  
1. Immediate ECG to assess for ischemic changes.
2. Administer sublingual nitroglycerin for symptom relief.
3. Initiate intravenous fluids and oxygen therapy to maintain blood pressure and oxygen saturation.
4. Obtain cardiac biomarkers (troponins) for further evaluation of myocardial damage.
5. Consult with a cardiologist for potential further management, including possible angiography if indicated by the initial workup.
6. Prescribe aspirin and consider clopidogrel for antiplatelet therapy pending cardiology consultation.
7. Advise complete cessation of smoking.

Follow-up Instructions:  
The patient requires urgent follow-up with a cardiologist within the next 24 hours for further management and ongoing care. He should return to the emergency department if symptoms worsen or recur. Regular follow-up appointments will be scheduled post-evaluation by the cardiology team. The patient is advised to maintain a cardiac-friendly lifestyle, including smoking cessation, regular exercise, and a heart-healthy diet.
