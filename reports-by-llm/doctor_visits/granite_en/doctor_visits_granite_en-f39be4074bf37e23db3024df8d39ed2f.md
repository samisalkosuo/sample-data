Patient Gender: Female
Patient Age: 99

Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient, a 99-year-old female, presents with a chief complaint of generalized fatigue and mild shortness of breath during exertion. She also reports occasional dizziness upon standing.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient has been experiencing progressive fatigue over the past month, which has limited her ability to perform daily activities. She describes the shortness of breath as a new symptom that occurred two weeks ago and worsens with minimal exertion. The dizziness upon standing is intermittent and not associated with any syncopal episodes. There are no chest pains, cough, or sputum production. She denies any recent illnesses, fever, or weight changes. Her past medical history is significant for hypertension, well-controlled on lisinopril 5mg daily, and osteoarthritis managed with acetaminophen as needed.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears her stated age and in no immediate distress. Vital signs are within normal limits: blood pressure 130/76 mmHg, heart rate 82 bpm, respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, temperature 98.6°F (37°C), and oxygen saturation 98% on room air. Cardiovascular exam reveals a regular rhythm with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended with no organomegaly. Extremities show no edema, and peripheral pulses are 2+ and symmetrical. Neurological examination is unremarkable, with cranial nerves intact, strength 5/5 in all muscle groups, sensation intact, and coordination within normal limits.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's age, history of hypertension, and current symptoms of fatigue, shortness of breath, and occasional dizziness, a working diagnosis of possible orthostatic hypotension and age-related decline in functional capacity is made. Further evaluation for anemia or thyroid dysfunction may be warranted if initial investigations are unrevealing.

Plan / Treatment: 1. Recommend a complete blood count (CBC) and thyroid function tests to rule out anemia or thyroid disorders. 2. Advise the patient to increase her fluid and salt intake to help manage potential orthostatic hypotension. 3. Encourage gradual pacing of activities and avoid prolonged standing to minimize dizziness episodes. 4. Review medications, specifically lisinopril, to ensure it is not contributing to orthostatic hypotension; consider a morning trial of dose reduction if appropriate.

Follow-up Instructions: Please schedule a follow-up appointment in four weeks for review of laboratory results and assessment of symptom response to the recommended interventions. If symptoms worsen prior to this appointment, the patient should contact the clinic for further evaluation.
