Patient Age: 48

Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with a two-day history of progressive shortness of breath and chest pain.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 48-year-old male, reports the onset of symptoms approximately 48 hours ago. He describes a gradual worsening of dyspnea and substernal chest discomfort, rated as 7/10 at its peak. The pain is non-radiating and not exacerbated by exertion or positional changes. He denies any cough, hemoptysis, or fever. There are no significant past medical history of cardiovascular diseases, but he has a family history of coronary artery disease.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears mildly distressed and is sitting upright in bed due to dyspnea. Vital signs are as follows: Blood pressure 140/90 mmHg, heart rate 95 bpm, respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation 92% on room air, and temperature 37°C. Cardiovascular examination reveals regular rhythm with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended with no organomegaly. Extremities show no edema. Neurological examination is unremarkable.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's age, recent onset of severe dyspnea, and chest discomfort without significant cardiovascular risk factors, a working diagnosis of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or possible pneumonia is considered. Further investigations are warranted to rule out other differentials such as pulmonary embolism or myocardial infarction.

Plan / Treatment:
1. Order a chest X-ray to evaluate for pneumonia, atelectasis, or pneumothorax.
2. Administer albuterol/ipratropium nebulizer treatments for bronchodilatation and relief of dyspnea.
3. Initiate intravenous corticosteroids (methylprednisolone 40mg) to address potential exacerbation of COPD or inflammatory processes.
4. Obtain laboratory tests, including complete blood count, electrolytes, and basic metabolic panel.
5. Initiate supplemental oxygen therapy via nasal cannula at 2L/min to maintain oxygen saturation above 90%.
6. Admit the patient for close monitoring and further evaluation.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be contacted regarding the results of investigations within 24 hours. He should return for a follow-up appointment in one week unless admitted for further management. In the meantime, he is advised to avoid strenuous activities and maintain hydration.
