Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with a persistent cough and mild shortness of breath, which she has been experiencing for the past two weeks. She also reports occasional wheezing and mild chest discomfort.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The 72-year-old female patient reports a gradual onset of a persistent dry cough, accompanied by mild shortness of breath and occasional wheezing over the past two weeks. She describes the chest discomfort as mild and intermittent, with no recent trauma or injury. She denies any fever, chills, or night sweats. Her current medications include lisinopril for hypertension and atorvastatin for hyperlipidemia. She has a history of atrial fibrillation and well-controlled type 2 diabetes.

Physical Examination Findings: On examination, the patient appears in no acute distress. Vital signs are within normal limits. Lung auscultation reveals mild bilateral wheezing, more prominent in the lower lobes. Aergolaterally, there is diminished breath sounds and prolonged expiration. Cardiovascular examination is unremarkable, with regular rate and rhythm, and no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and normoactive bowels. Extremities show no edema, and peripheral pulses are 2+. Neurological examination is non-contributory.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Based on the patient's history, physical examination findings, and considering her age and comorbidities, a working diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation is made. Further investigations, such as chest X-ray and spirometry, may be considered to confirm the diagnosis and assess the severity.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be started on a short course of a bronchodilator inhaler (salbutamol) as needed for symptom relief. She will also receive instructions on proper inhaler technique and usage. A referral to a pulmonologist for further evaluation and management is recommended. The patient should avoid known triggers, such as smoke and pollutants, and maintain regular follow-up with her primary care provider.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient is scheduled for a follow-up appointment in two weeks. If symptoms worsen or do not improve, she should contact the clinic immediately. In the meantime, she should monitor her symptoms daily and record any changes or concerns.
