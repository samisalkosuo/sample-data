Clinic or Hospital Location: Raisio  

Patient Gender: Male  
Patient Age: 63  

Severity Level: 2 (Emergent â€“ potential life threat)

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with acute onset of chest pain, shortness of breath, and diaphoresis.

History of Present Illness (HPI):  
The patient, a 63-year-old male, reports experiencing sudden-onset, severe substernal chest pain radiating to the left arm, accompanied by shortness of breath and profuse diaphoresis. The symptoms began approximately one hour ago while at rest. There is no known history of coronary artery disease or previous cardiac events. The patient denies any recent trauma, exertion preceding the onset, or other associated symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, or palpitations.

Physical Examination Findings:  
Vital signs reveal a blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg, heart rate of 110 bpm, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 88% on room air. The patient appears anxious and diaphoretic. Cardiovascular examination demonstrates irregular heart rhythm with a possible murmur heard best at the apex. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally with tachypnea. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended. Extremities show no edema or cyanosis. Neurological examination is unremarkable.

Assessment / Diagnosis:  
Given the patient's age, acute onset of severe chest pain radiating to the left arm, shortness of breath, diaphoresis, and abnormal vital signs, the working diagnosis is an acute coronary syndrome (ACS), likely unstable angina or non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).

Plan / Treatment:  
1. Immediate ECG to assess for ST-segment and T-wave changes.
2. Administer sublingual nitroglycerin 0.4 mg slowly, followed by repeat doses as needed for angina relief.
3. Administer aspirin 325 mg and initiate a P2Y12 inhibitor (e.g., clopidogrel 600 mg loading dose).
4. Obtain cardiac biomarkers (troponins) and a complete blood count, metabolic panel, and coagulation profile.
5. Initiate oxygen therapy via non-rebreather mask to maintain oxygen saturation above 92%.
6. Consult cardiology for further management and potential angiography if indicated by biomarker results and ECG findings.
7. Admit the patient to the cardiac care unit for continuous monitoring and treatment.

Follow-up Instructions:  
The patient will be closely monitored in the cardiac care unit, with plans for consultation with a cardiologist for further evaluation and management. The patient should follow up with his primary care provider within one week post-discharge for ongoing cardiac risk factor assessment and management. He should also adhere to any prescribed medications and lifestyle modifications as advised by the cardiology team.
