Patient Information:  
Gender: Male  
Age: 103  

Severity Level: 3 (Urgent – stable, needs 2+ resources)

Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient, a 103-year-old male, presents with progressive dyspnea and increased fatigue over the past week. He reports a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation.

History of Present Illness (HPI):  
The patient has a known history of COPD, managed with long-term budesonide/formoterol inhaler and occasional short-acting nebulized salbutamol as needed. Over the past week, he has experienced worsening dyspnea at rest and with minimal exertion, along with increased accessory muscle use and a productive cough with yellow sputum. He denies any recent fevers, chills, or chest pain but reports a 5 kg weight loss in the past month.

Physical Examination Findings:  
Vital signs: Blood pressure 130/80 mmHg, heart rate 110 bpm, respiratory rate 28 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation 86% on room air, temperature 98.6°F.  
General appearance: The patient appears cachectic and in moderate respiratory distress.  
HEENT: Normocephalic, atrophic, dry mucous membraces; pupils equal, round, and reactive to light; oropharynx clear.  
Cardiovascular: Regular rhythm, rapid rate; no murmurs, rubs, or gallops; jugular venous pressure elevated at 15 cm H2O in semirecumbent position.  
Lungs: Decreased breath sounds bilaterally with prolonged expiration and wheezing throughout. Beggar's erythema noted on the intercostal spaces.  
Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, non-distended; no organomegaly or masses identified.  
Extremities: Cool to touch with decreased peripheral pulses; no edema.  
Neurological: Alert and oriented to person, place, and time; gait uncertain due to dyspnea.

Assessment / Diagnosis:  
The patient's presentation is consistent with a severe exacerbation of COPD, likely secondary to infection or medication non-adherence. The elevated respiratory rate, use of accessory muscles, and hypoxemia support this diagnosis. Further investigation with chest X-ray and sputum culture is recommended to rule out pneumonia.

Plan / Treatment:  
1. Administer supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula at 4 L/min, maintaining SpO2 >90%.  
2. Initiate intravenous corticosteroids (methylprednisolone 125 mg) and broad-spectrum antibiotics (ceftriaxone 2 g and azithromycin 500 mg, given the patient's age and risk for multidrug-resistant organisms).  
3. Arrange chest X-ray to evaluate for pneumonia.  
4. Initiate pulmonary rehabilitation referral post-stabilization for ongoing management of COPD.

Follow-up Instructions:  
Schedule a follow-up appointment in 48 hours to assess response to treatment and adjust therapy as needed. Continue daily outpatient follow-up with the primary care provider for ongoing COPD management. Encourage smoking cessation counseling if applicable.
