Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with sudden onset of severe chest pain, shortness of breath, and diaphoresis.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 64-year-old female, reports experiencing sudden onset of severe substernal chest pain radiating to the left arm, accompanied by shortness of breath and profuse sweating, approximately 30 minutes prior to arrival. She has no known history of coronary artery disease but does have a history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus type 2.

Physical Examination Findings: The patient appears distressed, diaphoretic, and in moderate respiratory distress. Blood pressure is 160/90 mmHg, heart rate is 110 beats per minute, respiratory rate is 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 88% on room air. Auscultation reveals crackles in the lung bases. ECG shows ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, and aVF, suggestive of an acute inferior myocardial infarction.

Assessment / Diagnosis: The patient is experiencing an acute inferior myocardial infarction, likely secondary to coronary artery occlusion. This presentation is consistent with the severity level 1, indicating immediate life threat.

Plan / Treatment: Immediate resuscitation measures are initiated, including oxygen therapy, aspirin administration, and nitroglycerin sublingual. The patient is urgently transferred to a nearby cardiac catheterization laboratory for potential percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to restore blood flow in the affected coronary artery.

Follow-up Instructions: Following successful revascularization, the patient will require close monitoring in an intensive care unit (ICU) for at least 24 hours. She will then be transferred to a cardiac care unit (CCU) for further management. The patient will need long-term follow-up with a cardiologist and potentially a cardiac rehabilitation program. She should also continue medication as prescribed by her cardiologist, including antiplatelet agents, statins, and possibly beta-blockers or ACE inhibitors. Regular follow-up appointments will be scheduled to monitor her progress and adjust treatment as necessary.
