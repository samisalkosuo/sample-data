Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient, a 100-year-old male, presents with progressive dyspnea and fatigue over the past two weeks. He reports orthopneic breathing and occasional paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient denies any chest pain but describes a dry cough and intermittent wheezing. He has a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease stage 3, all well-controlled on medication. He reports no recent weight loss or fever.

Physical Examination Findings: Vital signs are within normal limits for age except for a respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute. Auscultation reveals bilateral basal crackles and decreased breath sounds. Cardiovascular exam shows regular rhythm with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended with no organomegaly. Extremities show peripheral edema up to the knees bilaterally. Neurological exam is unremarkable.

Assessment / Diagnosis: The patient's symptoms, advanced age, and comorbidities suggest a possible exacerbation of chronic heart failure (CHF). Further evaluation with echocardiography and chest X-ray is recommended to confirm the diagnosis.

Plan / Treatment: Initiate treatment for suspected acute decompensated heart failure with intravenous furosemide 40mg, bumetanide 1mg, and oral carvedilol 6.25mg twice daily. Monitor renal function closely due to the patient's chronic kidney disease. Consider referral to a cardiologist for further management.

Follow-up Instructions: Schedule an appointment with the cardiologist within one week for a comprehensive evaluation and potential adjustment of heart failure medications. Instruct the patient to follow up in the clinic in 2 weeks for reassessment of symptoms and renal function. Advise strict adherence to dietary sodium restriction and fluid management at home.
