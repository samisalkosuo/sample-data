Clinic or Hospital Location: Kiuruvesi
Severity Level: 3 (Urgent â€“ stable, needs 2+ resources)
Patient Gender: Male
Patient Age: 25

Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with a 48-hour history of progressive left-sided facial droop, difficulty speaking, and numbness in the right arm, raising concern for a possible ischemic stroke.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 25-year-old male, reports the onset of symptoms approximately 48 hours ago. He describes a sudden weakness on the left side of his face, causing asymmetry when he smiles or attempts to close his eyes. He also reports difficulty finding words and slurred speech. Additionally, he experiences numbness and tingling in his right arm, which has gradually worsened over time. There is no known history of migraine, seizure, or previous neurological events.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears alert but visibly distressed due to his symptoms. Vital signs are within normal limits, except for mild tachycardia (heart rate 98 bpm). Neurological examination reveals left-sided facial droop with asymmetry, suggestive of a cranial nerve VII deficit. Speech is sluggish and effortful with some dysarthria. The right upper extremity demonstrates reduced sensation to light touch and pinprick, suggesting a possible sensory loss consistent with a cortical or brainstem lesion. There are no other focal neurological deficits.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's age, presentation of facial droop, speech difficulties, and right-sided sensory changes, the differential diagnosis includes ischemic stroke (likely middle cerebral artery territory) or transient ischemic attack (TIA). Further investigations are warranted to confirm the diagnosis.

Plan / Treatment:
1. Immediate non-contrast head CT scan to rule out hemorrhagic causes of neurological symptoms.
2. Urgent neuroimaging with MRI or CT angiography to assess for ischemic stroke or intracranial hemorrhage.
3. Initiate blood pressure and heart rate monitoring, as well as oxygen therapy.
4. Administer aspirin 300 mg and consider thrombolytic therapy (e.g., alteplase) if eligible based on neuroimaging results and time from symptom onset.
5. Consult neurology for further management and potential endovascular or interventional procedures, if indicated.
6. Admit the patient to a monitored setting for continuous observation and treatment.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be followed up by the neurology team once the initial investigations are completed. Further management plans will be discussed at that time. The patient should return for an outpatient follow-up appointment within one week post-discharge to assess neurological recovery and discuss long-term stroke prevention strategies, including lifestyle modifications and potential medication adjustments.
