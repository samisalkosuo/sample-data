Severity Level: 1  
Patient Gender: Female  
Patient Age: 61  

Chief Complaint – The patient presents with acute-onset chest pain, shortness of breath, and diaphoresis.

History of Present Illness (HPI) – The patient, a 61-year-old female, reports experiencing sudden onset of severe substernal chest pain radiating to the left arm, accompanied by dyspnea and profuse sweating approximately 30 minutes prior to arrival. She has no significant past medical history but is a lifelong non-smoker.

Physical Examination Findings – On presentation, the patient appears anxious and diaphoretic. Her vital signs are noteworthy for a blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg, heart rate of 110 bpm, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 90% on room air, and temperature of 37°C. Cardiovascular examination reveals a regular but tachycardic rhythm with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally with tachypnea. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended with normoactive bowels. Extremities show no edema, and peripheral pulses are intact. Neurological examination is unremarkable.

Assessment / Diagnosis – Given the patient's age, sex, acute onset of severe chest pain radiating to the left arm, dyspnea, diaphoresis, and tachycardia, she meets criteria for possible acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Immediate cardiac monitoring and laboratory investigations including cardiac biomarkers are warranted.

Plan / Treatment – The patient will be administered aspirin 300mg chewed, sublingual nitroglycerin 0.4mg under the tongue, and oxygen via non-rebreather mask at 15L. She will undergo immediate ECG and cardiac biomarkers (troponin, CK-MB). If results are positive for myocardial injury, she will be transferred to a nearby cardiac catheterization lab for potential intervention.

Follow-up Instructions – The patient should return to the emergency department in 24 hours for follow-up ECG and clinical assessment unless symptoms worsen prior to that time. She is advised to contact her primary care physician or return immediately if symptoms recur or change in nature.
