Clinic or Hospital Location: Hammarland  

Patient Gender: Female  
Patient Age: 38  

Severity Level: 2 (Emergent â€“ potential life threat)

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with acute onset of severe abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.

History of Present Illness (HPI):  
The patient reports experiencing sudden onset of severe epigastric pain radiating to the back, accompanied by non-bloody emesis and an inability to retain oral intake since this morning. The pain is rated as 9/10 in intensity. She denies any fever, diarrhea, or changes in bowel habits. She has no significant past medical history but mentions a family history of gallstones.

Physical Examination Findings:  
Vital signs are within normal limits except for mild tachycardia (105 bpm). Abdominal examination reveals guarding, rebound tenderness, and positive Murphy's sign, suggesting a possible acute cholecystitis. No costovertebral angle tenderness is noted.

Assessment / Diagnosis:  
Based on the patient's presentation, physical examination findings, and risk factors (family history of gallstones), the working diagnosis is acute cholecystitis. Further diagnostic tests such as a complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, and abdominal ultrasound are recommended to confirm this suspicion.

Plan / Treatment:  
1. Admit for further evaluation and management of suspected acute cholecystitis.
2. Administer intravenous fluids for hydration and pain control with IV meperidine 50mg as needed.
3. Obtain blood tests (CBC, CMP) and an abdominal ultrasound urgently.
4. Consult surgery for potential cholecystectomy if imaging confirms the diagnosis.

Follow-up Instructions:  
The patient will be closely monitored in the hospital setting. Once diagnosed, she will require a follow-up appointment with the surgeon to discuss further management options, which may include laparoscopic cholecystectomy. She should also schedule a follow-up visit with her primary care provider within one week post-discharge for wound care and suture removal if applicable.
