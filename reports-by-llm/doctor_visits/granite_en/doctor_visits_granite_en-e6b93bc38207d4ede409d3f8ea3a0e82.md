30.08.2024 - Finström Clinic Visit Report

Chief Complaint: The patient, a 19-year-old male, presents with acute onset of severe chest pain and shortness of breath.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient reports experiencing sudden, crushing substernal chest pain radiating to the left arm, accompanied by diaphoresis and nausea. The symptoms began approximately 30 minutes ago while engaging in light physical activity. There is no history of similar episodes or significant past medical conditions.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears anxious and in moderate distress. Vital signs reveal a blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg, heart rate of 110 bpm, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 92% on room air, and temperature of 37°C. Cardiovascular examination demonstrates regular rhythm with a grade III/VI holosystolic murmur heard best at the apex. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended. Extremities show no signs of edema or cyanosis. Neurological examination is unremarkable.

Assessment / Diagnosis: The patient's presentation is concerning for acute coronary syndrome (ACS), specifically unstable angina or possible non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). Given the severity and nature of symptoms, further diagnostic workup is warranted.

Plan / Treatment: Immediate ECG will be performed to evaluate for ischemic changes. Laboratory tests including cardiac biomarkers (troponin, CK-MB) will be ordered. The patient will be started on sublingual nitroglycerin for symptom relief and oxygen therapy via nasal cannula at 2 L/min to maintain oxygen saturation above 94%. Intravenous access will be established for potential medications, fluids, or blood thinners. The patient will be closely monitored in the cardiac care unit until further evaluation is complete.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will require close monitoring and follow-up with a cardiologist for further management of his condition. He should return to the emergency department if symptoms worsen or recur. Regular outpatient follow-up will be scheduled once his condition is more stable.
