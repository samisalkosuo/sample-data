Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with progressive dyspnea and lower extremity edema of one-week duration.

History of Present Illness (HPI): An 83-year-old male reports a one-week history of worsening shortness of breath, particularly with minimal exertion, and bilateral lower extremity swelling up to his knees. He denies any chest pain, cough, or fever. His symptoms have been gradually worsening since onset.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient is in mild distress due to dyspnea. Vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 140/85 mmHg, heart rate 92 bpm, respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation 90% on room air, and temperature 36.8°C. Cardiovascular examination reveals regular rhythm but a III/VI holosystolic murmur best heard at the apex. Lungs are bilaterally diffusely crackles. Lower extremities show 2+ pitting edema up to mid-thighs. No peripheral erythema or warmth is noted.

Assessment / Diagnosis: The patient's presentation is suggestive of congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation, likely secondary to decompensated left ventricular dysfunction. The new onset of significant dyspnea and worsening lower extremity edema in an elderly male with a history of cardiovascular disease is concerning for acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF).

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be initiated on intravenous furosemide 40mg, followed by oral loop diuretic therapy (bumetanide 1mg daily) upon discharge. He will also receive oral lisinopril 5mg daily for long-term management of hypertension and heart failure. Additional supportive care includes supplemental oxygen to maintain oxygen saturation above 92%, and close monitoring of weight and symptoms.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient should follow up with his primary care physician within one week for assessment of response to treatment and adjustment of medications as needed. He is also advised to return to the emergency department if symptoms worsen or he experiences new or severe symptoms before the scheduled appointment.
