Clinic or Hospital Location: Hyrynsalmi  

Patient Gender: Female  
Patient Age: 13 years old  

Severity Level: 5 (Non-urgent â€“ minor complaints)

Chief Complaint: The patient, a 13-year-old female, presents with a 3-day history of intermittent abdominal pain and mild nausea. She reports that the pain is located in the lower abdomen, radiating to the lower back, and is worse after meals. There are no associated symptoms such as fever, vomiting, diarrhea, or changes in urination.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient first noticed the pain on [insert date], which started gradually and has been intermittent since then. She denies any recent trauma, weight loss, or changes in bowel habits. Her menstrual history is unremarkable for dysmenorrhea or irregular periods.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears well-groomed and in no acute distress. Vital signs are within normal limits. Abdominal examination reveals mild tenderness to palpation in the lower abdomen, more on the right side, without rebound or guarding. Bowel sounds are present and normal. There is no organomegaly or masses detected.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Based on the history and physical examination, the most likely diagnosis is functional abdominal pain, possibly related to a food intolerance or gastrocolic reflex exacerbation. Other differentials such as appendicitis, ovarian torsion, or urinary tract infection have been considered and ruled out due to the lack of suggestive symptoms and normal examination findings.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be reassured regarding her condition and advised on dietary modifications to identify potential food triggers. She will be prescribed over-the-counter antacids for temporary symptom relief. A follow-up appointment in 4-6 weeks is recommended if symptoms persist or worsen.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient should return to the clinic if she experiences worsening pain, fever, vomiting, or any other concerning symptoms. She should also follow up if her dietary modifications do not alleviate her discomfort within the recommended timeframe.
