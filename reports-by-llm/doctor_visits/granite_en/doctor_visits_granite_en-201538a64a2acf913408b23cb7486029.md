Visit Date: 27.07.2024  
Clinic or Hospital Location: Vesanto  

Patient Gender: Male  
Patient Age: 95  

Severity Level: 4 (Less-urgent â€“ stable, stable, 1 resource)

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with a chief complaint of progressive dysphagia and unintentional weight loss over the past two months.

History of Present Illness (HPI):  
The 95-year-old male reports difficulty swallowing solid foods for approximately eight weeks, which has led to significant unintentional weight loss of about 10 pounds. He denies any chest pain, shortness of breath, or fever but mentions occasional regurgitation and food getting stuck in his throat. There is no history of recent illness, travel, or sick contacts.

Physical Examination Findings:  
Vital signs are within normal limits for age. The patient appears well-nourished but thin compared to previous visits. Oral cavity examination reveals mild erythema and small, non-exudative lesions on the posterior pharynx. Neck examination is unremarkable with no palpable lymphadenopathy. Abdominal examination shows no tenderness or organomegaly.

Assessment / Diagnosis:  
Given the patient's age, history of dysphagia, and recent significant weight loss, along with physical findings suggestive of pharyngeal abnormalities, a working diagnosis of glossopharyngeal neuralgic dysphagia or possible early-stage pharyngeal cancer is considered. Further investigations are warranted to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential causes.

Plan / Treatment:  
1. Referral for otolaryngology consultation for further evaluation, including endoscopy.
2. Initiate a trial of high-calorie, liquid supplements to maintain nutritional status.
3. Prescribe a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) to manage potential gastroesophageal reflux symptoms, which may exacerbate dysphagia.
4. Schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks for further assessment and discussion of investigation results.

Follow-up Instructions:  
The patient is scheduled for an otolaryngology consultation within one week. In the interim, he should continue with liquid supplements and report any worsening symptoms or complications immediately. A follow-up appointment will be arranged in two weeks to review investigation results and discuss further management plans based on the diagnosis.
