Clinic or Hospital Location: Hirvensalmi  

Patient Gender: Male  
Patient Age: 45  

Severity Level: 3 (Urgent â€“ stable, needs 2+ resources)

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with a persistent cough, progressive shortness of breath, and intermittent chest pain for the past two weeks. He reports increased anxiety and fatigue.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The 45-year-old male patient reports the onset of symptoms approximately two weeks ago. Initially, he experienced a dry cough and mild shortness of breath, which have since progressed to a persistent cough with occasional sputum production and significant dyspnea with minimal exertion. He describes the chest pain as sharp, intermittent, and worsening with deep inspiration or positional changes. The patient denies fever, night sweats, or weight loss but mentions occasional wheezing audible during auscultation.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears anxious and fatigued. Vital signs are within normal limits except for a respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute. Auscultation reveals bilateral wheezing and decreased breath sounds in the lower lobes. Percussion elicits dullness, and permutation is positive in the right lower lung field, suggesting possible consolidation. No cyanosis or clubbing is noted.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Based on the patient's history, physical examination findings, and progressive symptoms, a probable diagnosis of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with possible pneumonia is considered. Further diagnostic testing, such as chest X-ray and spirometry, will be pursued to confirm the diagnosis and assess the severity.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will receive a course of oral corticosteroids (prednisolone 40mg daily) and antibiotics (azithromycin 500mg once daily) for seven days to address potential exacerbation and possible bacterial pneumonia. Inhaled bronchodilators (salbutamol/albuterol inhaler as needed) will be prescribed for symptomatic relief. The patient is advised to follow up in one week or sooner if symptoms worsen.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient should return for a follow-up appointment in one week for reassessment and review of diagnostic test results. He is also encouraged to schedule an urgent appointment if his condition deteriorates before the scheduled follow-up. Additionally, he will be referred to a pulmonologist for further management and smoking cessation counseling.
