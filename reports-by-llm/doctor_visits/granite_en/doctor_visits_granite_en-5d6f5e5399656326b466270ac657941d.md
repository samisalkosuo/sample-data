Visit Date: 08.06.2024  
Clinic or Hospital Location: Ylivieska  

Patient Gender: Male  
Patient Age: 76  

Severity Level: 5 (Non-urgent â€“ minor complaints)

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with a persistent cough and mild shortness of breath for the past two weeks. He also reports occasional wheezing, especially at night.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The 76-year-old male patient has been experiencing a gradual onset of a dry cough, accompanied by mild dyspnea on exertion and intermittent wheezing for the past two weeks. He denies any recent travel, sick contacts, or known allergies. He reports no significant past medical history but mentions occasional seasonal allergies. The symptoms have been gradually worsening, prompting his visit today.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears in no acute distress. Vital signs are within normal limits. Auscultation of the lungs reveals bilateral basal crackles. Breath sounds are diminished with decreased air entry in the lower lobes. No wheezing is heard at rest. Cardiovascular and abdominal examinations are unremarkable.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Based on the patient's history, physical examination findings, and considering his age and minor symptoms, a working diagnosis of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is made. The patient's mild dyspnea, cough, and occasional wheezing are consistent with this condition.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be started on a short course of oral prednisolone 20mg daily for five days to help reduce airway inflammation. He will also receive a prescription for salbutamol inhaler (2 puffs as needed for dyspnea) to manage acute symptoms. The patient is advised to follow up if symptoms worsen or do not improve within a week.

Follow-up Instructions: Please schedule a follow-up appointment in one week to reassess symptoms and adjust treatment if necessary. In the meantime, encourage the patient to avoid known triggers (e.g., smoke, pollutants) and maintain good hydration. Advise him to contact the clinic immediately if he experiences worsening dyspnea, increased cough, or any other concerning symptoms.
