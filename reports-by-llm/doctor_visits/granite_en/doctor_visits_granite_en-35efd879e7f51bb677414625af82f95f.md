Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with a three-day history of progressive lower abdominal pain, fever, and dysuria. She reports experiencing frequent, burning urination and mild pelvic pressure.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The 29-year-old female patient reports the onset of her symptoms three days ago. Initially, she experienced mild lower abdominal cramps, which have since progressed to moderate, constant pain. She describes the discomfort as a dull ache, worsening with movement and relieved by staying still. Alongside the abdominal pain, she has developed a fever up to 38.5°C and experienced burning sensation during urination. She denies any vaginal discharge or changes in her menstrual cycle.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears well-groomed but visibly uncomfortable. Her vital signs are within normal limits except for a temperature of 38.2°C. Abdominal examination reveals mild tenderness in the lower quadrants, with no rebound or guarding. No costovertebral angle tenderness is noted. Digital rectal examination is unremarkable without gross bleeding. Urinalysis shows pyuria with a few white blood cells and bacteriuria.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Based on the patient's history, physical examination findings, and laboratory results, she is diagnosed with a possible urinary tract infection (UTI) with potential extension to the lower abdominal muscles, leading to myofascial pain. Further investigation with urine culture is recommended for appropriate antibiotic selection.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be prescribed a course of cephalosporin antibiotics (cefdotrizine 500mg PO tid for seven days) to address the suspected bacterial UTI. She is advised to increase fluid intake and stay hydrated to facilitate urination and alleviate discomfort. Over-the-counter pain relief medication (ibuprofen 400mg PO q6hrs as needed) can be used for pain management.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient is instructed to return for a follow-up visit in seven days or sooner if symptoms worsen, fever persists, or she develops flank pain. She should also contact the clinic immediately if she experiences chills, nausea, vomiting, or signs of sepsis. Urine culture results will be available within 48-72 hours and will guide further management if necessary.
