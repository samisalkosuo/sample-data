Patient Age: 100

Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient, a 100-year-old male, presents with progressive fatigue and mild dyspnea on exertion for the past two weeks. He also reports a gradual decrease in appetite and unintentional weight loss of approximately 5 kg over the last month.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient denies any chest pain, orthopnea, or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. He has a history of well-controlled hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus managed with medications. There is no known history of cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or sleep apnea. The patient lives independently at home with assistance for daily activities.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears aged but in no immediate distress. Vital signs are within normal limits. Cardiovascular exam reveals regular rhythm with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdominal exam is benign with no organomegaly or tenderness. Extremities show no signs of peripheral edema. Neurological exam is grossly intact for age.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's advanced age, progressive fatigue, unintentional weight loss, and mild dyspnea on exertion, a thorough differential diagnosis includes chronic heart failure, anemia, and possible malnutrition or gastrointestinal pathology. Further investigations are warranted to rule out these conditions.

Plan / Treatment:
1. Complete blood count (CBC) with differential
2. Comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP)
3. Thyroid function tests (TFTs)
4. Vitamin B12 and folate levels
5. Echocardiogram to assess cardiac function
6. Chest X-ray to evaluate lung fields
7. Referral to a gastroenterologist for possible endoscopy, depending on further test results

Follow-up Instructions: The patient is scheduled for a follow-up appointment in two weeks to review the investigational results and discuss management plans based on the findings. In the meantime, encourage the patient to maintain hydration and a balanced diet as tolerated. Advise against strenuous activities and provide support for any necessary home modifications to ensure safety.
