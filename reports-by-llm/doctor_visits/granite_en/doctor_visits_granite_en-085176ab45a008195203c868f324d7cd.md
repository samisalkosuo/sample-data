Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient, a 13-year-old female, presents with a 3-day history of intermittent abdominal pain and mild fever. She reports feeling generally unwell but denies any vomiting, diarrhea, or blood in stool.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient first noticed the abdominal pain yesterday evening, which she describes as a dull ache in the lower right quadrant, intermittent and worsening with movement. She also reports a low-grade fever of approximately 38°C, measured at home. There are no significant past medical history, allergies, or family history of gastrointestinal disorders.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears well-developed for her age and in moderate distress due to abdominal pain. Vital signs are within normal limits except for a temperature of 37.8°C. Abdominal examination reveals mild tenderness in the right lower quadrant with no rebound or guarding. Bowel sounds are present and normal. No costovertebral angle tenderness is noted.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's age, presentation, and physical examination findings, a likely diagnosis of appendicitis is considered, although less typical for this age group. Further investigations are warranted to confirm or rule out this condition.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be referred for an urgent abdominal ultrasound to evaluate the appendix and surrounding structures. She will be prescribed over-the-counter pain relief medication as needed for symptomatic relief. She is advised to maintain hydration with clear fluids.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient should return to the clinic following her ultrasound appointment for a review of results and further management. If symptoms worsen before the ultrasound, she should seek immediate medical attention.
