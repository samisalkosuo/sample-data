Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient, a 9-year-old male, presents with a 3-day history of progressive difficulty breathing, increased cough, and fever. His mother reports that he has had a mild sore throat for the past week, which has now worsened.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient's symptoms began with a mild sore throat a week ago, which has since progressed to include fever, chills, and a persistent cough. Over the past 3 days, the patient has developed increasing shortness of breath, waking up at night due to difficulty breathing. He denies any recent trauma, travel, or contact with sick individuals.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient is alert and oriented but appears uncomfortable. His vital signs are as follows: Temperature - 38.5°C (101.3°F), Heart Rate - 120 bpm, Respiratory Rate - 40 breaths/min, Oxygen Saturation - 92% on room air. Physical examination reveals tonsillar exudates, bilateral ear drainage, and decreased breath sounds in the lower lobes of the lungs.

Assessment / Diagnosis: The patient's presentation is consistent with a severe bacterial pharyngitis with potential complications, such as epiglottitis or bronchopneumonia. Given his age, symptoms, and physical examination findings, a working diagnosis of acute bacterial tonsillitis with possible lower respiratory tract involvement is made.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be started on intravenous ceftriaxone for suspected group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis and prescribed oral dexamethasone for potential airway edema. He will be admitted for further monitoring, including blood tests, throat culture, and chest X-ray. Oxygen therapy will be provided as needed to maintain oxygen saturation above 92%.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will require close monitoring in the hospital for the next 24-48 hours. After discharge, he should follow up with our clinic in 7 days for suture removal (if tonsillectomy is performed) and to ensure resolution of symptoms. He will also need to complete a full course of antibiotics as prescribed. The family should contact us immediately if the patient's condition worsens or if they notice any new symptoms.
