Clinic or Hospital Location: Koski Tl  

Patient Gender: Female  
Patient Age: 24  

Severity Level: 3 (Urgent – stable, needs 2+ resources)

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with a 3-day history of progressively worsening abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. She reports a high fever and significant weight loss over the past week.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient is a 24-year-old female who first noticed mild abdominal discomfort two days ago, which has since escalated to severe, constant pain localized to the right lower quadrant. She describes the pain as sharp and intermittently radiating to her back. Accompanying symptoms include non-bloody diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. She also reports a high fever up to 102°F (38.9°C) and significant unintentional weight loss of approximately 5 kg over the past week.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears moderately distressed but maintains stable vital signs within normal ranges. Abdominal examination reveals guarding, rebound tenderness, and palpable mass in the right lower quadrant. Bowel sounds are hyperactive, and there is no rebound or flank tenderness. Digital rectal examination is unremarkable with no masses identified.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's presentation of right lower quadrant abdominal pain, fever, nausea, vomiting, and significant weight loss, a working diagnosis of appendicitis is strongly suspected. Further investigations are warranted to confirm this suspicion.

Plan / Treatment:  

1. Admission for further evaluation and management.  
2. Order complete blood count (CBC), comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), and urinalysis.  
3. Obtain an abdominopelvic CT scan with contrast to assess for appendicitis or other intra-abdominal pathology.  
4. Administer intravenous fluids and pain management with IV diclofenac as needed.  
5. Consult surgical service for potential appendectomy if imaging and clinical findings support the diagnosis of acute appendicitis.  

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored during her hospital stay, with a planned discussion with the surgical team regarding further management. If the diagnosis of appendicitis is confirmed, she will likely require an appendectomy. Postoperatively, she should follow up in the outpatient clinic within one week for wound inspection and removal of sutures if applicable. Additionally, she should schedule a follow-up appointment with her primary care provider to address any underlying causes contributing to her recent weight loss.
