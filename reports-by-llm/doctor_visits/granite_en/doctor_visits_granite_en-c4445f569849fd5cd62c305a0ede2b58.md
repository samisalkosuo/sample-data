Clinic Location: Hartola

Patient: Female, 82 years old
Severity Level: 3 (Urgent – stable, needs 2+ resources)

Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with progressive dyspnea and a productive cough for the past three days. She reports feeling increasingly fatigued and experiencing mild chest pain.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, an 82-year-old female, reports the onset of symptoms approximately three days ago. She describes a gradual worsening of shortness of breath (dyspnea) while performing daily activities, which has now become difficult even at rest. She also reports a persistent productive cough with yellowish sputum and mild chest pain exacerbated by deep breaths or coughing. There is no known history of similar episodes.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears comfortable but visibly labored during respiration. Vital signs are as follows: Blood pressure 130/80 mmHg, heart rate 95 bpm, respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation 90% on room air, and temperature 36.8°C. Auscultation reveals bilateral basal crackles and decreased breath sounds in the lower lobes. Cardiovascular examination shows regular rhythm with no murmurs or gallops. There is no peripheral edema noted.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's age, symptoms of dyspnea, productive cough, and decreased oxygen saturation, along with auscultatory findings, a likely diagnosis of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) is made. Further evaluation with chest X-ray and arterial blood gas analysis is recommended to confirm the diagnosis and assess severity.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be initiated on a course of systemic corticosteroids (prednisolone 20mg daily), bronchodilators (salbutamol nebulizer every 4 hours as needed for dyspnea), and antibiotics (cephalexin 500mg IV once daily) to address potential bacterial superinfection. Oxygen therapy will be provided via nasal cannula at a rate of 2L/min to maintain oxygen saturation above 92%.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient is advised to return for a follow-up appointment in one week or sooner if symptoms worsen. She should also contact the clinic immediately if she experiences increased dyspnea, changes in sputum color or volume, fever, or any other concerning symptoms. A chest X-ray and arterial blood gas analysis will be performed prior to her follow-up visit to assess treatment response and adjust management as necessary.
