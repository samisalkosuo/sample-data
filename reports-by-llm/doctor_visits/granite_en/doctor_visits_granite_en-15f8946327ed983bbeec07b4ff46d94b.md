Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with a 2-day history of progressive difficulty breathing, intermittent chest pain, and increased anxiety.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The 16-year-old male patient reports the onset of symptoms approximately 48 hours ago. He describes a gradual worsening of dyspnea, particularly with exertion, and intermittent sharp chest pain that worsens with deep breaths or coughing. The patient also mentions increased anxiety levels, which he attributes to his breathing difficulties. He denies any fever, cough, or sputum production.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears anxious and in mild distress. Vital signs are as follows: temperature 98.6°F, blood pressure 130/85 mmHg, heart rate 110 bpm, respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 92% on room air. Auscultation reveals bilateral basal crackles and decreased breath sounds in the lower lung fields. There is no wheezing or prolonged expiration. Cardiovascular examination shows tachycardia with regular rhythm and no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. The abdomen is soft, non-tender, and normoactive bowel sounds are heard. Extremities show no edema, and peripheral pulses are strong and equal bilaterally. Neurological examination is unremarkable.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's age, presenting symptoms, and physical examination findings, a working diagnosis of acute exacerbation of asthma with possible pneumonia is considered. Further investigations, including chest X-ray and spirometry, are recommended to confirm this assessment and rule out other differentials such as pneumonia or pulmonary embolism.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be initiated on a nebulized bronchodilator treatment with albuterol (2.5 mg) and ipratropium bromide (0.5 mg). Oral prednisone 40 mg will be prescribed for anti-inflammatory effects. The patient will also receive a course of ceftriaxone 500 mg as an empiric antibiotic for possible pneumonia. Close monitoring and reassessment of respiratory status are advised.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient should return for a follow-up appointment in 48 hours or sooner if symptoms worsen. He will also need to complete spirometry testing and have a chest X-ray, which will be scheduled during this visit. If the patient's condition does not improve or deteriorates, he may require hospital admission for further management.
