Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with a 3-day history of progressive shortness of breath, intermittent chest pain, and mild fever. He reports feeling unusually fatigued and experiencing occasional palpitations.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 28-year-old male, reports the onset of symptoms approximately three days ago. Initially, he experienced mild intermittent chest discomfort, which has since become more constant and associated with exertion. He describes the pain as a pressure-like sensation, worsening with deep breaths or physical activity. Over the past 48 hours, he has developed progressive shortness of breath, particularly when lying flat, prompting him to sleep in a semi-upright position. Additionally, he reports a low-grade fever and intermittent episodes of palpitations. He denies any cough, hemoptysis, or recent travel.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears mildly distressed but in no immediate respiratory distress. Vital signs are as follows: Temperature 38°C (100.4°F), Heart rate 102 bpm, Respiratory rate 20 breaths/min, Blood pressure 130/85 mmHg, and Oxygen saturation 96% on room air. Cardiovascular examination reveals tachycardia with regular rhythm and no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, but there is mild tactile fremitus over the right lower lung fields. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and normoactive bowel sounds. Extremities show no edema, and peripheral pulses are strong and equal bilaterally. Neurological examination is unremarkable.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's age, recent onset of symptoms, and physical findings, a working diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia with associated pleural effusion is considered. The patient's tachycardia, fever, and mild respiratory distress support this assessment. Further investigations, including chest X-ray and blood tests (complete blood count, inflammatory markers, and blood cultures), will be arranged to confirm the diagnosis and guide management.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be commenced on a course of intravenous antibiotics targeting common respiratory pathogens, along with an analgesic for pain relief. He will also receive supplemental oxygen as needed to maintain comfort and improve oxygenation. Diuretics may be considered if the patient's condition deteriorates or if there is evidence of fluid overload. The patient will undergo a chest X-ray and have blood tests ordered for further evaluation.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient should return for a follow-up appointment in one week to assess response to treatment and re-evaluate symptoms. If there is no improvement or if symptoms worsen before this time, he should seek immediate medical attention. He will also be advised to contact the clinic if he develops new or worsening symptoms prior to the follow-up appointment.
