Clinic or Hospital Location: Vaala  

Patient Gender: Female  
Patient Age: 57  

Severity Level: 5 (Non-urgent – minor complaints)

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with a persistent cough and mild shortness of breath for the past two weeks. She also reports occasional chest tightness, which she attributes to stress.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient is a 57-year-old female who has been experiencing a dry, non-productive cough for approximately two weeks. The cough is worse in the morning and occasionally triggers mild shortness of breath. She describes the chest tightness as a pressure sensation, which she believes is exacerbated by stress. She denies any fever, chills, hemoptysis, or recent weight loss. Her past medical history is significant for well-controlled hypertension and mild asthma, for which she takes an inhaler as needed. She has no known drug allergies and takes no regular medications apart from her blood pressure medication.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears comfortable and in no acute distress. Vital signs are within normal limits: blood pressure 130/80 mmHg, heart rate 72 bpm, respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation 98% on room air, and temperature 98.6°F. Lung auscultation reveals mild bibasilar crackles without wheezes or rhonchi. Cardiovascular examination is unremarkable with regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and bowel sounds are present. Extremities show no edema, and peripheral pulses are strong bilaterally. Neurological examination is non-contributory.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's age, history of mild asthma, and current symptoms, a diagnosis of acute exacerbation of asthma is considered likely. The mild bibasilar crackles may represent pulmonary congestion secondary to the cough and increased work of breathing.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be started on a short course of a low-dose inhaled corticosteroid (e.g., fluticasone 250 mcg twice daily) along with an albuterol inhaler as needed for symptom relief. She will also be advised to use her rescue inhaler more frequently until symptoms improve. A follow-up appointment is scheduled in two weeks for reassessment. In the meantime, she should avoid known triggers and maintain hydration.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient is instructed to return in two weeks for a follow-up visit to assess her response to treatment and to ensure resolution of symptoms. She should monitor her peak expiratory flow rates at home if possible and report any worsening symptoms or new onset fever immediately. Additionally, she will be provided with written instructions regarding the proper use of her inhalers and a list of potential triggers to avoid.
