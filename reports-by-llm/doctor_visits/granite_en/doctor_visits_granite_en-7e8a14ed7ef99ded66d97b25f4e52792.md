Clinic or Hospital Location: Vaala  

Patient Gender: Female  
Patient Age: 23  

Severity Level: 5 (Non-urgent – minor complaints)

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with a persistent cough and mild sore throat for the past three days. She reports occasional low-grade fever but denies any shortness of breath, chest pain, or wheezing.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient is a 23-year-old female who has been experiencing a dry cough and sore throat for the past three days. She reports intermittent low-grade fevers, peaking around 100.4°F (38°C), but denies any other constitutional symptoms such as headache, muscle aches, or fatigue. She has not traveled recently and has had no known exposure to infectious individuals. Her menstrual history is unremarkable, and she reports regular cycles.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears well-groomed and in no acute distress. Vital signs are within normal limits: blood pressure 120/78 mmHg, heart rate 76 bpm, respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, temperature 99.2°F (37.3°C), and oxygen saturation 98% on room air. Oral mucous membranes are moist, and there is no evidence of exudative lesions. The pharyngeal examination reveals mild erythema with no posterior pharyngeal wall injection or exudate. The lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. There are no adenopathy or rashes noted on the torso or extremities.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Based on the patient's history and physical examination, she is likely suffering from a viral upper respiratory tract infection (URTI), possibly caused by Enterovirus or Adenovirus, given her age and symptom profile. The absence of more severe symptoms such as dyspnea, chest pain, or systemic manifestations supports this diagnosis.

Plan / Treatment: Given the non-urgent nature of her complaint and the likely viral etiology, supportive care is recommended. The patient will be advised to maintain hydration with clear fluids and over-the-counter analgesics for symptomatic relief if needed. A prescription for a cough suppressant may be considered if symptoms worsen. No antibiotics are indicated at this time, as they would not affect viral infections and could contribute to antibiotic resistance.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient is advised to contact the clinic again if her symptoms worsen, particularly if she develops shortness of breath, chest pain, or high fever. Otherwise, she should expect a full recovery within 7-10 days without complications. She will be reminded that if symptoms persist beyond this timeframe or if new concerning symptoms arise, she should seek further medical attention.
