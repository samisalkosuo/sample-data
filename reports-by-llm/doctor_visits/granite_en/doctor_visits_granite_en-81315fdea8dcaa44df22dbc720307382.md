Clinic or Hospital Location: Kärsämäki  

Severity Level: 3 (Urgent – stable, needs 2+ resources)  

Patient Gender: Female  
Patient Age: 52  

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with a chief complaint of progressive dyspnea and chest discomfort for the past three days. She reports feeling increasingly short of breath at rest, which has led her to seek immediate medical attention.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient is a 52-year-old female who began experiencing intermittent chest tightness and mild dyspnea two days ago. Over the past 24 hours, she reports worsening symptoms, with now constant shortness of breath at rest and occasional sharp, pleuritic chest pain exacerbated by deep inspiration or coughing. She denies any fever, chills, or night sweats but mentions a 5 kg weight loss over the past month due to decreased appetite. She has no significant past medical history and is currently not on any medications.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears anxious and in moderate distress. Vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 130/80 mmHg, heart rate 95 bpm, respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation 92% on room air, and temperature 36.8°C. General appearance is cachectic with mild peripheral edema noted in the lower extremities. Auscultation reveals bilateral basal crackles and decreased breath sounds in the left lower lobe. Cardiovascular examination shows regular rhythm with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops audible. There is no jugular venous distention.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's presentation of progressive dyspnea, chest discomfort, and physical examination findings (basal crackles, decreased breath sounds in left lower lobe), a working diagnosis of possible pneumonia or pulmonary embolism is considered. Further investigations are warranted to rule out these conditions.

Plan / Treatment: 

1. Order a stat chest X-ray to evaluate for pneumonia or pulmonary embolism.
2. Administer supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula to maintain oxygen saturation above 92%.
3. Initiate intravenous antibiotics (e.g., Ceftriaxone) pending culture results, given the suspicion of pneumonia.
4. Order complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, D-dimer, and cardiac biomarkers to guide further management.
5. Consult with a pulmonologist or cardiologist for potential further evaluation (e.g., CT angiography) if initial investigations suggest pulmonary embolism.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be contacted within 24 hours regarding the results of her chest X-ray and blood tests. Depending on these findings, she may require further evaluation (e.g., CT angiography) or admission for intravenous antibiotics and closer monitoring. She should return to the clinic in one week for a follow-up appointment to assess resolution of symptoms and ensure no complications have arisen. In the meantime, she is advised to avoid strenuous activity and to contact her healthcare provider if symptoms worsen or new symptoms develop.
