Clinic or Hospital Location: Loviisa  

Patient Gender: Male  
Patient Age: 10  

Severity Level: 2 (Emergent – potential life threat)

Chief Complaint: The patient, a 10-year-old male, presents with acute abdominal pain, fever, and vomiting.

History of Present Illness (HPI):  
The patient reports experiencing sudden onset of severe epigastric pain, rated as 8/10 in intensity, approximately 6 hours ago. The pain is constant, sharp, and radiates to the back. Accompanying symptoms include fever up to 39°C (102.2°F) and three episodes of non-bilious, non-blood-containing emesis in the past hour. There is no history of similar episodes or significant past medical conditions.

Physical Examination Findings:  
Vital signs: Temperature 39°C (102.2°F), heart rate 110/min, respiratory rate 22/min, blood pressure 110/70 mmHg, and oxygen saturation 98% on room air. The patient appears distressed, guarding the abdomen, and has tenderness primarily in the epigastric region with rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds are reduced, and there is no peritoneal signs.

Assessment / Diagnosis:  
Given the acute onset of severe epigastric pain, fever, and vomiting without any known history or risk factors for gastrointestinal bleeding, the differential diagnosis includes appendicitis, mesenteric lymphadenitis, or a possible viral gastroenteritis. The severity level of 2 suggests potential life-threatening conditions such as appendicitis requiring urgent intervention.

Plan / Treatment:  
1. Admission for further evaluation and management.
2. Intravenous fluid resuscitation initiated to maintain hydration and address dehydration from vomiting.
3. Empiric antibiotics started (Ceftriaxone 50mg/kg IV once, then continue orally for 7 days) to cover possible bacterial infection.
4. Pain management with Ibuprofen 2.6mg/kg PO every 6-8 hours as needed.
5. Abdominal X-ray and Ultrasound ordered to evaluate for any obstruction or abnormalities.
6. Blood tests including complete blood count, C-reactive protein, and metabolic panel.

Follow-up Instructions:  
The patient will be closely monitored in the pediatric ward. If imaging confirms appendicitis, the patient may require surgical consultation for appendectomy. Otherwise, follow-up will depend on the diagnosis and treatment response. Parents should contact the clinic if symptoms worsen or new symptoms develop before the scheduled follow-up appointment in one week.
