Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient, a 105-year-old female, reports experiencing intermittent fatigue and mild shortness of breath during daily activities. She also mentions occasional joint discomfort in her knees and lower back.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient has been experiencing these symptoms for the past two weeks. She describes the fatigue as a gradual onset, worsening towards the end of the day. The shortness of breath occurs primarily during moderate exertion, such as climbing stairs or walking longer distances. Joint discomfort is most noticeable in the morning and improves with movement. She denies any chest pain, cough, fever, or recent injuries. Her past medical history is significant for age-related osteoarthritis and hypertension, both well-controlled on current medications.

Physical Examination Findings: On examination, the patient appears alert and oriented to person, place, and time. Vital signs are within normal limits. Cardiovascular exam reveals regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Lungs are clear bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended with no organomegaly. Musculoskeletal examination shows mild tenderness to palpation over the medial joint lines of both knees and lower spine, consistent with osteoarthritis. No erythema or warmth is noted. Neurological exam is non-focal.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's age, past medical history, and current symptoms, it is likely that her fatigue and shortness of breath are related to age-related physiological changes and mild osteoarthritis contributing to joint discomfort. There is no evidence of acute distress or exacerbation of chronic conditions.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be advised to continue her current medications for hypertension and osteoarthritis as prescribed. She will benefit from regular, low-impact exercises such as swimming or stationary cycling to improve strength and flexibility without exacerbating joint discomfort. Over-the-counter pain relievers (e.g., acetaminophen or ibuprofen) can be used for occasional joint discomfort. A referral to physical therapy may be considered for a personalized exercise program.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient should follow up in 4-6 weeks for a routine check-up, at which time her symptoms and response to the recommended lifestyle modifications will be reassessed. If symptoms worsen or new complaints arise before this scheduled appointment, she should contact the clinic for further evaluation.
