Clinic or Hospital Location: Alavieska  

Patient Gender: Male  
Patient Age: 89  

Severity Level: 1 (Immediate life threat)

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with acute-onset chest pain, shortness of breath, and diaphoresis.

History of Present Illness (HPI): An 89-year-old male reports experiencing sudden, severe chest pain radiating to his left arm, accompanied by dyspnea and profuse sweating, which began approximately 30 minutes ago while resting at home. The patient has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and a previous myocardial infarction. He denies any recent exertion or emotional stress preceding the onset of symptoms.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient is in moderate distress, diaphoretic, and has a blood pressure of 100/60 mmHg, heart rate of 120 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 88% on room air. Cardiovascular examination reveals irregular heart rhythm with no discernible pulse, hypotension, and cold, clammy extremities. Lung auscultation demonstrates bilateral wheezing.

Assessment / Diagnosis: The patient is experiencing an acute coronary syndrome, likely a non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), given the presentation of chest pain, radiation to the left arm, dyspnea, and recent history of coronary artery disease.

Plan / Treatment: Immediate resuscitation measures are initiated, including oxygen therapy, aspirin 325 mg, nitroglycerin 0.4 mg sublingually, and morphine sulfate 2 mg for pain control. The patient is urgently transferred to the cardiac catheterization lab for potential percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Laboratory tests, including cardiac biomarkers, are ordered.

Follow-up Instructions: Following stabilization and treatment, the patient will be closely monitored in the coronary care unit (CCU) for at least 24 hours post-procedure. Subsequent follow-up will be arranged with a cardiologist to optimize medical management, including antiplatelet therapy, statin therapy, and potential referral for cardiac rehabilitation. The patient's primary care provider will be notified of the hospital course and discharge medications.
