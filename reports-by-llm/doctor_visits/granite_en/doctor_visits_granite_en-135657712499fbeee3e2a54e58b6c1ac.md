Patient Age: 83

Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient, an 83-year-old female, presents with a chief complaint of progressive fatigue and mild shortness of breath over the past two weeks. She also reports occasional dizziness upon standing.

History of Present Illness (HPI):  
The patient has been experiencing gradual onset of fatigue, rating 7/10 in severity, which has been worsening over the past fortnight. She describes the fatigue as a persistent, moderate weakness that limits her ability to perform daily activities. The shortness of breath is mild, occurring with minimal exertion, and is rated 4/10 in severity. Additionally, she has noticed episodes of dizziness upon standing, which last for a few seconds and resolve with sitting. There is no history of chest pain, cough, or fever.

Physical Examination Findings:  
Vital signs are within normal limits. The patient appears her stated age, in mild discomfort. Cardiovascular exam reveals a regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended with no organomegaly. Extremities show no edema, and peripheral pulses are 2+ and symmetric. Neurological examination is unremarkable except for mild postural hypotension with a drop in blood pressure of approximately 10 mmHg upon standing from supine position.

Assessment / Diagnosis:  
Given the patient's age, presentation of progressive fatigue, mild dyspnea, and orthostatic dizziness without other significant findings, the most likely diagnosis is age-related physiological changes contributing to exercise intolerance and postural hypotension. Further evaluation for anemia, thyroid dysfunction, and cardiac status is recommended.

Plan / Treatment:  
1. Complete blood count (CBC) to rule out anemia.
2. Thyroid function tests (TFTs).
3. Electrocardiogram (ECG) for assessment of cardiac status.
4. Begin a gradual, supervised exercise program under physical therapy guidance to improve functional capacity and address orthostatic intolerance.
5. Recommend increasing fluid and salt intake to enhance blood volume and combat postural hypotension.
6. Advise against sudden changes in position to minimize dizziness episodes.

Follow-up Instructions:  
The patient is scheduled for a follow-up appointment in four weeks to reassess symptoms, review test results, and adjust the treatment plan as necessary. In the interim, she should maintain hydration, monitor her symptoms, and report any worsening or new complaints promptly.
