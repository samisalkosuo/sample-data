Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with acute abdominal pain and visible peritoneal signs.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient is a 29-year-old female who reports the onset of severe, constant, and sharp abdominal pain approximately 4 hours ago. The pain is localized to the right lower quadrant (RLQ) and radiates to her back. She describes the pain as a 10/10 in intensity. Associated symptoms include nausea, vomiting, and a single episode of bloody diarrhea. She denies any fever, chills, or urinary symptoms. The patient's last menstrual period was normal two weeks ago, and she is not currently using contraception.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears distressed but is hemodynamically stable with a blood pressure of 120/78 mmHg, heart rate of 95 bpm, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and temperature of 36.8°C. Abdominal examination reveals guarding, rebound tenderness, and a positive Rovsing's sign in the RLQ. Murphy's sign is positive. There is no costovertebral angle tenderness or rebound. Bowel sounds are hyperactive and borborygmus can be heard. Digital rectal examination reveals no masses but some blood noted on the glove.

Assessment / Diagnosis: The patient's presentation is concerning for acute appendicitis, given her age, right lower quadrant pain, guarding, rebound tenderness, and positive Rovsing's sign. Laboratory tests show a leukocyte count of 15,000/uL with a left shift. Urinalysis is unremarkable.

Plan / Treatment: The patient requires urgent imaging with an abdominopelvic CT scan to confirm the diagnosis and assess for complications. If the CT confirms acute appendicitis, she will be referred to a surgeon for prompt appendectomy. In the meantime, she will receive intravenous fluids, pain management with IV diclofenac, and antiemetics for nausea and vomiting.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient should return to the clinic within 48 hours post-imaging for review of results and further management plans. If she undergoes surgery, follow-up will be determined by the surgical team.
