Clinic or Hospital Location: Kyyjärvi  

Patient Gender: Male  
Patient Age: 29  

Severity Level: 3 (Urgent – stable, needs 2+ resources)

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with a 3-day history of progressive shortness of breath and intermittent chest pain. He reports feeling increasingly fatigued and experiencing mild fever.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 29-year-old male, reports the onset of symptoms approximately three days ago. Initially, he experienced mild intermittent chest pain, which has since become more constant and associated with shortness of breath at rest and exertion. He describes the chest pain as a pressure-like sensation, worsening with deep inspiration and relieved by sitting upright. Additionally, he reports fever up to 38.5°C, which has been fluctuating. He denies any cough, hemoptysis, or recent travel.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears mildly distressed but is in stable condition. Vital signs are as follows: Blood pressure 130/85 mmHg, heart rate 92 bpm, respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, temperature 38.2°C, and oxygen saturation 92% on room air. Auscultation reveals bilateral basal crackles and decreased breath sounds in the lower lobes. Cardiovascular examination shows regular rhythm with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. There is no peripheral edema noted.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's age, presentation of progressive dyspnea, chest pain, and fever, along with physical examination findings such as bilateral basal crackles and decreased breath sounds in the lower lobes, a working diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) with possible pleural effusion is considered. Further investigations are warranted to confirm this suspicion.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be started on intravenous antibiotics (Ceftriaxone and Azithromycin) targeting common respiratory pathogens, along with corticosteroids (Methylprednisolone) for potential ARDS. He will also receive oxygen therapy to maintain saturation above 92%. Blood tests, including complete blood count, inflammatory markers, and chest X-ray, will be arranged urgently. If the diagnosis of pneumonia with pleural effusion is confirmed, a chest ultrasound may be considered for further evaluation.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient should return for a follow-up appointment in 48 hours to reassess his clinical status and review investigation results. If symptoms worsen or do not improve as expected, he should seek immediate medical attention. He will also need to complete the full course of antibiotics as prescribed, even if symptoms resolve earlier.
