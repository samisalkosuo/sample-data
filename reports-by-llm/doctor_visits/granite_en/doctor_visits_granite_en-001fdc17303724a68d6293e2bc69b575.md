30.09.2023 - Paimio Clinic Visit Report

Chief Complaint: The patient, a 21-year-old male, presents with acute onset of severe left flank pain radiating to the groin, associated with nausea and dysuria.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient reports that the pain began approximately 6 hours ago and has been progressively worsening. He describes it as a sharp, constant pain rated at 8/10 in intensity. The patient denies any history of similar episodes but mentions occasional mild right flank pain over the past month, which he attributed to weightlifting. He reports no fever, chills, or hematuria but acknowledges increased thirst and urination frequency over the past week.

Physical Examination Findings: The patient appears distressed due to pain. Vital signs are within normal limits. Abdominal examination reveals tenderness in the left lower quadrant with rebound tenderness, guarding, and a positive Rovsing's sign. No costovertebral angle tenderness is noted. Digital rectal examination is unremarkable. Urinalysis shows pyuria without hematuria or infection markers.

Assessment / Diagnosis: The patient's presentation is suggestive of left renal colic secondary to a possible urinary tract obstruction, likely caused by a renal stone.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be prescribed pain management with ibuprofen and hydrocortisone for nausea. Intravenous fluids will be administered for hydration. A non-contrast helical CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis is recommended to confirm the diagnosis and assess the stone's size and location. If the scan confirms a renal stone, referral to urology for potential extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) or ureteroscopy will be arranged.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient should follow up with the clinic in one week for a review of symptoms and CT scan results. If symptoms worsen before this appointment, he should seek immediate urological consultation. Additionally, the patient is advised to increase water intake and maintain a diary of urinary habits to monitor progress.
