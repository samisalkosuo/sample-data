Patient Age: 62

Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with a persistent cough and mild shortness of breath for the past two weeks. He also reports occasional wheezing and mild chest discomfort.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The 62-year-old male patient has been experiencing a gradual onset of a persistent cough, mild shortness of breath, occasional wheezing, and mild chest discomfort for approximately two weeks. He denies any recent travel, sick contacts, or known allergies. He reports no significant past medical history but mentions a 15-pack-year smoking history that ceased 10 years ago.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears comfortable and in no acute distress. Vital signs are within normal limits. Auscultation of the lungs reveals bilateral wheezing more prominent in the lower lobes. Percussion and palpation of the chest reveal no tenderness or abnormalities. Cardiovascular examination is unremarkable, with regular heart rhythm and rate.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Based on the patient's history and physical examination findings, the working diagnosis is chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation. The patient's smoking history and current symptoms support this assessment. Further diagnostic testing, such as spirometry and chest imaging, may be considered if the symptoms worsen or do not respond to initial management.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be started on a short course of a bronchodilator inhaler (e.g., albuterol) as needed for symptom relief. He will also receive instructions on proper inhaler technique and inhaler use. The patient is advised to avoid known triggers, maintain hydration, and monitor his symptoms closely. A follow-up appointment will be scheduled in two weeks for reassessment.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient should return for a follow-up visit in two weeks or sooner if symptoms worsen or do not improve. He will receive instructions on performing spirometry at home and interpreting the results. If symptoms persist or worsen, he should seek immediate medical attention.
