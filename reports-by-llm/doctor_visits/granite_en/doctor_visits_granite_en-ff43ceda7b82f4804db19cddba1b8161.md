Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with a 3-day history of progressive lower abdominal pain, fever, and dysuria. She reports experiencing frequent, painful urination and lower back discomfort.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient is a 32-year-old female who first noticed mild lower abdominal discomfort two days ago, which has since escalated to severe, constant pain. She reports fever up to 38.5°C and increased frequency, urgency, and pain during urination. The patient denies any vaginal discharge or vomiting but mentions mild headache and fatigue.

Physical Examination Findings: On examination, the patient appears well-hydrated but in moderate distress due to abdominal pain. Vital signs are within normal limits except for a temperature of 38.2°C. Abdominal examination reveals tenderness in the lower quadrants with rebound tenderness, guarding, and no visible peritoneal signs. Digital rectal examination is positive for mild left-sided tenderness without gross bleeding or masses.

Assessment / Diagnosis: The patient's presentation is suggestive of acute pyelonephritis, likely secondary to a urinary tract infection (UTI). This diagnosis is based on the history of dysuria, frequency, fever, and lower abdominal pain, along with physical examination findings.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be started on intravenous fluids for hydration and prescribed empirical antibiotics (Ceftriaxone 500mg IV once daily and Nitrofurantoin 100mg orally twice daily for a total of 7 days) to treat the suspected acute pyelonephritis. Urinalysis and urine culture will be ordered to confirm the diagnosis and guide antibiotic therapy. The patient will also receive analgesia (Ibuprofen 400mg orally every 6-8 hours as needed for pain) and symptomatic relief for fever (Paracetamol 1g orally every 6 hours as needed).

Follow-up Instructions: The patient should return for a follow-up appointment in one week to review her response to treatment, assess symptom resolution, and obtain the results of urine culture. If there is no improvement or worsening of symptoms before the scheduled follow-up, she should contact the clinic for further evaluation.
