Severity Level: 3 (Urgent â€“ stable, needs 2+ resources)
Patient Gender: Male
Patient Age: 105

Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient, a 105-year-old male, presents with progressive dyspnea and increased fatigue over the past week. He reports a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient describes a gradual worsening of shortness of breath at rest and with minimal exertion. He has experienced increased anxiety and orthopnea, often awakening at night due to breathlessness. He denies any recent fevers, chills, or cough but reports a productive sputum with occasional streaks of blood.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient is in moderate respiratory distress, using accessory muscles for breathing. His oxygen saturation is 82% on room air, improving to 92% with supplemental oxygen via non-rebreather mask. Auscultation reveals bilateral basal crackles and decreased breath sounds. Cardiovascular examination shows regular rhythm with hypotension (90/60 mmHg) and tachycardia (120 bpm). There is no jugular venous distention or lower extremity edema.

Assessment / Diagnosis: The patient's presentation is consistent with a severe exacerbation of COPD, likely secondary to pneumonia given the new-onset hemoptysis and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS).

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be initiated on intravenous corticosteroids (methylprednisolone 125 mg), broad-spectrum antibiotics (piperacillin-tazobactam 3.375 g q6h), and bronchodilators (albuterol nebulizer q4h). Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy will be initiated for improved oxygenation and reduced work of breathing. Close monitoring for clinical deterioration and potential need for mechanical ventilation is warranted.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient should be closely monitored in the hospital setting for at least 48 hours, with serial exams, vital signs, and arterial blood gases (ABGs). Once stable, he will be transferred to a step-down unit for continued management. A consultation with a pulmonologist and infectious disease specialist is recommended for further evaluation and management. The patient's primary care provider will be notified of the admission, discharge, and transfer summaries, along with the treatment plan.
