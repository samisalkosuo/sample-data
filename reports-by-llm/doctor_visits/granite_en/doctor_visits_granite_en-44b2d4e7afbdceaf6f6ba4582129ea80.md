Patient Age: 97

Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient, a 97-year-old female, presents with a chief complaint of progressive fatigue and mild shortness of breath over the past two weeks. She also reports a persistent cough and occasional chest tightness.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient denies any recent illnesses or changes in her usual medication regimen. She has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and mild cardiovascular disease. The symptoms began gradually, with increasing dyspnea during daily activities. She reports no fever, chills, or hemoptysis.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears her stated age, in moderate distress due to breathing efforts. Vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 130/80 mmHg, heart rate 95 bpm, respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation 92% on room air, and temperature 98.6°F. Lung auscultation reveals bilateral basal crackles. Cardiovascular examination shows regular rhythm with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and bowel sounds are present. Extremities show mild peripheral edema up to the knees. Neurological examination is unremarkable.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's age, history of COPD exacerbation, and current symptoms, it is likely that she is experiencing a moderate exacerbation of her chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The findings are consistent with congestive heart failure as well, given the peripheral edema and elevated blood pressure.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be started on a short course of oral corticosteroids (prednisolone 20mg daily) for her suspected COPD exacerbation. In addition, she will receive a loop diuretic (furosemide 20mg once daily) to manage her congestive heart failure symptoms. She will continue her current maintenance medications as prescribed, including long-acting bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids. A follow-up chest X-ray is recommended to assess lung fields.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient should return for a follow-up appointment in one week to reassess her symptoms and response to treatment. If there is no improvement or if symptoms worsen, she should seek immediate medical attention. In the meantime, she should monitor her oxygen saturation levels at home using a pulse oximeter and contact the clinic if her oxygen levels drop below 90% on room air.
