Visit Date: 08.08.2024  
Clinic or Hospital Location: Lemi  

Severity Level: 4  
Patient Gender: Female  
Patient Age: 69  

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with progressive dyspnea and a productive cough for the past week. She reports increased shortness of breath at rest and orthopnea, which has led to significant sleep disturbance.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The 69-year-old female patient reports the onset of her symptoms approximately one week ago. Initially, she experienced a mild cough and occasional chest tightness. Over the past few days, her symptoms have worsened, with increasing dyspnea at rest and exertion. She describes her current breathing effort as 8 on a scale of 1-10, with frequent episodes of wheezing and a greenish sputum. She denies any recent travel, sick contacts, or known allergies. Her past medical history is significant for hypertension and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) on long-term home oxygen therapy. She takes inhaled budesonide/formoterol as needed and atorvastatin 40mg daily.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears anxious and in moderate respiratory distress. Vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 130/80 mmHg, heart rate 110 bpm, respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation 88% on room air, and temperature 98.6Â°F. Auscultation reveals bilateral wheezing throughout lung fields with prolonged expiration phase. Cardiovascular examination shows regular rhythm with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. There is mild lower extremity edema up to the knees.

Assessment / Diagnosis: The patient's presentation is consistent with an acute exacerbation of her COPD, likely precipitated by a respiratory infection. She demonstrates signs of moderate respiratory distress and hypercapnia (pH not yet available but expected to be low). Given her age, comorbidities, and current symptoms, she requires immediate intervention to manage her airway, breathing, and circulation.

Plan / Treatment: 

1. Administer 2 puffs of albuterol via nebulizer for bronchodilation.
2. Initiate intravenous corticosteroids (methylprednisolone 125mg) to reduce airway inflammation.
3. Start antibiotics (azithromycin 500mg once daily) to address possible bacterial infection.
4. Continue current maintenance medications as prescribed, including inhaled budesonide/formoterol as needed for relief.
5. Monitor vital signs and oxygen saturation every 15 minutes for the next 2 hours, then hourly until stable.
6. Arrange for chest X-ray to evaluate for pneumonia or other complications.
7. Admit the patient for further observation and management of her acute exacerbation.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be followed up in clinic within 48 hours post-admission for reassessment of her respiratory status and adjustment of treatment as needed. She should contact her primary care provider immediately if symptoms worsen or new symptoms develop before the scheduled follow-up. She will also receive instructions on home oxygen therapy management, inhaler technique, and potential need for pulmonary rehabilitation referral post-discharge.
