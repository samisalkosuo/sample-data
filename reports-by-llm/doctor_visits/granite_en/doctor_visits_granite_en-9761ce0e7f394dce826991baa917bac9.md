Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with progressive dyspnea and lower extremity edema of one-week duration.

History of Present Illness (HPI): A 71-year-old male reports a one-week history of worsening shortness of breath, particularly with minimal exertion, and bilateral lower extremity swelling up to his knees. He denies any chest pain, cough, or fever. His symptoms began gradually and have steadily worsened since onset. The patient has a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and atrial fibrillation for which he takes warfarin and metformin, respectively. He reports compliance with his medications.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient is in moderate respiratory distress. Vital signs include a blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg, heart rate of 95 bpm, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 88% on room air. Auscultation reveals bilateral crackles in the lung bases. Cardiovascular examination shows an irregularly irregular rhythm with a rate of 95 bpm, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. There is 2+ pitting edema in both lower extremities up to mid-thigh. No peripheral adenopathy is noted.

Assessment / Diagnosis: The patient's presentation is concerning for acute decompensated heart failure secondary to atrial fibrillation, exacerbated by noncompliance with dietary restrictions and possible medication side effects. Further evaluation with an electrocardiogram (ECG) and echocardiography is recommended to assess the severity of arrhythmia and cardiac function.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be initiated on intravenous furosemide 40mg for diuresis, oral metoprolol tartrate 25mg bid for rate control in atrial fibrillation, and subcutaneous enoxaparin 80mg daily for anticoagulation. He will be closely monitored for response to treatment. The patient's primary care physician will be contacted to adjust his metformin dosage and review his diabetes management.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient should return for a follow-up appointment in one week or sooner if symptoms worsen. He must adhere to a low-sodium diet, restrict fluid intake as advised, and weigh daily. He will also require close monitoring of INR levels and renal function.
