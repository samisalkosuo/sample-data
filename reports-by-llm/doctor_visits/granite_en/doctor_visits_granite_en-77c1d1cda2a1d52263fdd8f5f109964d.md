Visit Date: 10.05.2024  
Clinic or Hospital Location: Lumparland  

Patient Gender: Male  
Patient Age: 51  

Severity Level: 5 (Non-urgent – minor complaints)

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with a persistent cough and mild shortness of breath for the past two weeks. He also reports occasional chest tightness, which is worse in the evenings.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 51-year-old male, reports developing a dry cough approximately two weeks ago, which has been persistent and occasionally productive of clear sputum. He describes the cough as worse in the evenings and at night, often disturbing his sleep. Additionally, he has experienced mild shortness of breath with exertion and occasional chest tightness, particularly noticeable in the evenings. The patient denies any recent travel, sick contacts, or known allergies. He works as an office worker and reports no significant changes in his routine or environment.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears well-groomed and in moderate distress due to his symptoms. Vital signs are within normal limits: blood pressure 128/76 mmHg, heart rate 80 bpm, respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, temperature 98.4°F (37°C), and oxygen saturation 98% on room air. Lungs reveal mild decreased breath sounds bilaterally with occasional wheezing heard in the lower lobes. Cardiovascular examination is unremarkable, with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops noted. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended with no organomegaly. Extremities show no edema or cyanosis. Neurological examination is grossly intact.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Based on the patient's history and physical examination findings, he is likely suffering from acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), possibly triggered by a viral upper respiratory infection. The patient's mild hypoxemia and increased work of breathing support this diagnosis.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be prescribed a short course of a bronchodilator (e.g., albuterol) to help alleviate his symptoms. He will also receive instructions on proper inhaler technique and usage. Additionally, he is advised to increase ambient humidity in his home environment and maintain hydration. The patient will be scheduled for a follow-up appointment in two weeks unless his symptoms worsen prior to that time.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient should return for a follow-up visit in two weeks or sooner if his symptoms worsen, particularly if he experiences increased shortness of breath, persistent fever, or other concerning signs. He is advised to monitor his oxygen saturation levels at home using a pulse oximeter and contact the clinic immediately if his oxygen levels drop below 90% on room air. The patient will be provided with written instructions and a prescription for the bronchodilator upon discharge.
