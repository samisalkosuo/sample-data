Clinic or Hospital Location: Kerava  

Patient Gender: Female  
Patient Age: 72  

Severity Level: 4 (Less-urgent â€“ stable, stable, 1 resource)

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with a persistent cough and progressive shortness of breath over the past two weeks. She also reports intermittent chest pain and occasional wheezing.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The 72-year-old female patient reports the onset of her symptoms approximately two weeks ago, initially presenting with a dry cough that has since become productive with yellowish sputum. She describes her shortness of breath as progressively worsening, particularly with minimal exertion. The chest pain is described as sharp and intermittent, radiating to the left arm, and aggravated by deep inspiration or coughing. Occasional wheezing is noted during routine activities. She denies any recent travel, sick contacts, or known allergies. Her past medical history is significant for well-controlled hypertension and osteoarthritis. She is a non-smoker and has no history of respiratory diseases.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears mildly distressed but is in stable condition. Vital signs are within normal limits. Auscultation reveals decreased breath sounds in the left lower lung lobe with prolonged expiration and occasional wheezing. Percussion elicits dullness, and percussive fremitus is increased. There is no evidence of cyanosis or retractions. Cardiovascular examination shows regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and bowel sounds are present and active. Extremities show no edema, and peripheral pulses are strong bilaterally. Neurological examination is unremarkable.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Based on the patient's history, physical examination findings, and considering her age and comorbidities, a working diagnosis of pneumonia with possible underlying bronchiectasis is made. Further investigations including chest X-ray and sputum culture are recommended to confirm this suspicion and guide treatment.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be started on a course of oral antibiotics (Amoxicillin-Clavulanate 625mg BID for 7 days) targeting common respiratory pathogens, along with an inhaled bronchodilator (Albuterol as needed for dyspnea). She will also receive a short course of oral corticosteroids (Prednisone 20mg daily for 5 days) to reduce airway inflammation. She is advised to rest and increase fluid intake. Follow-up in one week is recommended for reassessment based on symptom improvement and further investigation results.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient should return for a follow-up appointment in one week to review her response to treatment, assess symptom resolution, and discuss the results of any diagnostic tests (chest X-ray, sputum culture). If there is no significant improvement or if symptoms worsen before this time, she should seek immediate medical attention. She will also be provided with instructions on recognizing signs of deterioration requiring urgent care.
