Patient: Female, 92 years old
Severity Level: 5 (Non-urgent)

Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient presents for a routine follow-up appointment regarding her chronic atrial fibrillation and hypertension. She reports feeling generally well but is concerned about her medication regimen and potential side effects.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 92-year-old female, has a history of chronic atrial fibrillation and hypertension. She has been on a stable regimen of warfarin, metoprolol, and lisinopril for the past six months. She denies any chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations at rest. Her blood pressure is well-controlled, typically around 130/80 mmHg. She reports occasional dizziness upon standing but denies syncope.

Physical Examination Findings: Vital signs are within normal limits for her age. Cardiovascular exam reveals a regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Blood pressure is 128/76 mmHg in the left arm and 110/65 mmHg in the right arm, suggesting orthostatic hypotension. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended with no organomegaly. Extremity examination shows no edema or signs of peripheral vascular disease. Neurological exam is grossly intact.

Assessment / Diagnosis: The patient's chronic atrial fibrillation remains well-controlled on her current medication regimen. Orthostatic hypotension is noted, likely secondary to her age and antihypertensive therapy. No acute interventions are indicated at this time.

Plan / Treatment: Continue current medications: warfarin 2 mg daily, metoprolol 50 mg daily, and lisinopril 10 mg daily. Advise the patient to monitor her blood pressure at home and report any significant changes or symptoms of orthostatic hypotension. Encourage regular physical activity and a heart-healthy diet. Schedule a follow-up appointment in three months for routine check-up and INR monitoring.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient is scheduled for a follow-up appointment in three months for routine check-up, medication review, and INR monitoring. She should contact the clinic immediately if she experiences any new or worsening symptoms, such as chest pain, shortness of breath, syncope, or significant changes in her blood pressure.
