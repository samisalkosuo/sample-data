Visit Date: 20.01.2025  
Clinic or Hospital Location: Suonenjoki  

Patient Gender: Male  
Patient Age: 50  

Severity Level: 3 (Urgent â€“ stable, needs 2+ resources)

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with a persistent cough, shortness of breath, and intermittent chest pain for the past two weeks. He also reports experiencing night sweats and unintentional weight loss.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient is a 50-year-old male who initially sought care for a persistent cough and mild fatigue one week ago. Over the past few days, his symptoms have progressed to include shortness of breath, intermittent chest pain, night sweats, and unintentional weight loss of approximately 5 pounds. He denies fever, chills, or hemoptysis. His occupation involves exposure to secondhand dust from construction sites.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears mildly distressed but is in stable condition. Vital signs are within normal limits. Auscultation of the lungs reveals decreased breath sounds and occasional wheezing in the lower lobes bilaterally. Percussion elicits dullness over the right lower lung fields, suggestive of possible pleural effusion. The remainder of the physical examination is unremarkable.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's history, physical examination findings, and occupational exposure, a working diagnosis of pneumonia with possible associated pleural effusion is made. Further diagnostic testing, including chest X-ray and possibly sputum culture, is recommended to confirm this suspicion and guide treatment.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be started on a course of intravenous antibiotics (e.g., ceftriaxone 2 grams once daily) and prescribed an albuterol inhaler for symptomatic relief of bronchospasm. He will also receive cough suppressants and analgesics as needed for discomfort. Oxygen therapy is not currently indicated but may be required if his respiratory status deteriorates.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient should return for a follow-up appointment in one week to assess response to treatment and re-evaluate symptoms. If there is no improvement or worsening of symptoms, he should seek immediate medical attention. Additionally, the patient will be referred to a pulmonologist for further evaluation and management. A chest X-ray and sputum culture will be arranged prior to his follow-up visit.
