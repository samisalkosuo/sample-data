Clinic or Hospital Location: Nokia  

Patient Gender: Female  
Patient Age: 16  

Severity Level: 5 (Non-urgent – minor complaints)

Chief Complaint: The patient, a 16-year-old female, presents with a persistent cough and mild fatigue for the past three days. She reports occasional nasal congestion and a low-grade fever.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient first noticed symptoms two days ago, starting with a sore throat and malaise. Over the next 24 hours, she developed a non-productive cough and intermittent nasal congestion. She denies any chest pain, shortness of breath, or wheezing. Her fever peaked at 37.8°C yesterday evening and has since decreased to normal range today. She has no known allergies and is up-to-date on her immunizations.

Physical Examination Findings: Vital signs are within normal limits. The patient appears well-nourished and in no acute distress. Her throat examination reveals mild erythema without exudates. Tympanic membranes are intact, and lung auscultation shows clear breath sounds bilaterally. Cardiovascular and abdominal exams are unremarkable.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Based on the patient's history and physical examination findings, she is likely suffering from a viral upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). The symptoms are consistent with a common cold or less commonly, early-stage influenza.

Plan / Treatment: Given the non-urgent nature of her complaints and the absence of severe symptoms, supportive care is recommended. The patient should maintain hydration with clear fluids and over-the-counter analgesics for fever and discomfort if needed. Prescription medication is not indicated at this time. If symptoms worsen or persist beyond seven days, she should return for further evaluation.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient should follow up in one week if her symptoms have not resolved or if they worsen. She can contact the clinic sooner if she experiences high fever, severe headache, chest pain, shortness of breath, or any other concerning symptoms.
