Clinic or Hospital Location: Eckerö  

Patient Gender: Male  
Patient Age: 12 years  

Severity Level: 3 (Urgent – stable, needs 2+ resources)

Chief Complaint: The patient, a 12-year-old male, presents with a 3-day history of progressive difficulty breathing, increased cough, and low-grade fever.

History of Present Illness (HPI):  
The patient's mother reports that the child first developed a mild cough and low-grade fever approximately 3 days ago. Over the past 24 hours, the symptoms have worsened, with increased shortness of breath, audible wheezing, and a persistent cough producing clear sputum. The patient has had no recent upper respiratory infections, allergies, or known history of asthma.

Physical Examination Findings:  
Vital signs: Temperature 37.8°C (100.04°F), heart rate 110 bpm, respiratory rate 28 breaths/min, blood pressure 110/65 mmHg, and oxygen saturation 92% on room air.  
General appearance: The child appears anxious but cooperative.  
HEENT: Normocephalic, atraumatic. Pupils equal, round, and reactive to light. Oropharynx clear.  
Cardiovascular: Tachycardia with regular rhythm. No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  
Respiratory: Increased respiratory rate and use of accessory muscles. Wheezing heard bilaterally in the lungs. Clear to auscultation.  
Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, no organomegaly.  
Extremities: No cyanosis, clubbing, or edema.

Assessment / Diagnosis:  
Based on the patient's history and physical examination findings, the working diagnosis is acute exacerbation of asthma. The patient presents with worsening respiratory symptoms, including increased shortness of breath, wheezing, and cough, which are consistent with an asthmatic episode.

Plan / Treatment:  
1. Administer a nebulized bronchodilator (albuterol 2.5 mg) to help alleviate airway constriction and improve breathing.
2. Provide supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula at 2 L/min to maintain oxygen saturation above 92%.
3. Prescribe a short-course of oral corticosteroids (prednisolone 2 mg/kg for 5 days) to reduce airway inflammation.
4. Instruct the parent on proper inhaler technique and administration of a short-acting beta-agonist (SABA) for home use as needed.
5. Schedule a follow-up appointment with a pediatric pulmonologist within one week to further evaluate and manage asthma symptoms.

Follow-up Instructions:  
The patient should return for a follow-up visit in one week or sooner if symptoms worsen, or if the child experiences difficulty breathing, increased cough, or fever. The parent should monitor the child's respiratory status and administer prescribed medications as directed. Additionally, they should avoid known triggers (if identified) to minimize asthma exacerbations.
