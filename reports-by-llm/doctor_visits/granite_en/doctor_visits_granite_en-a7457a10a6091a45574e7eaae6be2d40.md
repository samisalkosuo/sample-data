Clinic or Hospital Location: Asikkala
Severity Level: 2 (Emergent â€“ potential life threat)
Patient Gender: Female
Patient Age: 90

Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient, a 90-year-old female, presents with acute onset confusion and disorientation, reported by her caregiver. She has also experienced a sudden decline in oral intake and increased lethargy over the past 48 hours.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient's caregiver reports that she has been progressively more confused since yesterday, with difficulty following simple commands and orienting to person, place, and time. She has also shown a significant decrease in her usual daily intake, consuming only small amounts of liquids. The patient's lethargy is unusual for her, as she was previously active and engaged. There are no known recent falls or head injuries.

Physical Examination Findings: On examination, the patient appears disoriented to time, place, and person. Her vital signs are within normal limits, except for a mild tachycardia at 98 beats per minute. She has no fever or other signs of infection. Neurological examination reveals a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 12 (Eyes: E4, Verbal: T4, Motor: M6), indicating mild confusion. There are no focal neurological deficits. Her skin appears intact with no signs of pressure ulcers.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's age, acute onset confusion, and recent changes in behavior and dietary habits, a differential diagnosis includes delirium (likely secondary to an underlying medical condition), urinary tract infection (UTI), or other systemic infection. Further investigations are required to rule out these possibilities.

Plan / Treatment:
1. Order complete blood count (CBC), comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), and urine analysis including culture.
2. Administer intravenous fluids for hydration.
3. Initiate broad-spectrum antibiotics empirically, pending culture results, to cover common UTI pathogens.
4. Consult with the geriatric or internal medicine team for further management and potential etiology evaluation.
5. Monitor vital signs and neurological status closely.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be reassessed within 24 hours following the initiation of treatment and investigations. Depending on the results, further management plans may be adjusted. The caregiver is advised to monitor the patient's symptoms and report any changes or worsening immediately.
