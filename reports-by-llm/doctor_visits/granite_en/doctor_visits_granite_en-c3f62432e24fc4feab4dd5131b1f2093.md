Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient, an 8-year-old male, presents with a 3-day history of progressive difficulty breathing and increasing wheezing. The parent reports that the child has had a history of mild wheezing episodes in the past but this current episode is more severe and persistent.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient's symptoms began 3 days ago with occasional coughing and mild wheezing. Over the past 24 hours, the symptoms have worsened, with increased frequency of coughing, audible wheezing during both inspiration and expiration, and noticeable nasal flaring. The parent reports that the child has been using a nebulized bronchodilator at home as prescribed by a pediatrician in the past for milder episodes, but the current symptoms are not responding to this treatment.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient is an 8-year-old male appearing moderately distressed due to breathing difficulties. Vital signs reveal a respiratory rate of 36 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 90% on room air, and a temperature of 37Â°C. Auscultation of the lungs reveals bilateral wheezing throughout inspiration and expiration, with decreased air entry at the bases. There is no evidence of retractions or use of accessory muscles. Cardiovascular and abdominal examinations are unremarkable.

Assessment / Diagnosis: The patient's presentation is consistent with an acute exacerbation of asthma, given his history of mild intermittent wheezing episodes and current severe symptoms not responding to home treatment.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be administered a course of systemic corticosteroids (prednisolone 2mg/kg once daily) and nebulized salbutamol (2.5mg) every 4-6 hours as needed for wheezing. The parent will be instructed to use a spacer device with the inhaler for better drug delivery. The patient will also receive a course of oral antibiotics (azithromycin 10mg/kg once daily) due to concerns of possible viral-induced exacerbation, pending further diagnostic testing if indicated.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient should return for a follow-up appointment in one week to reassess symptoms and adjust treatment as necessary. In the interim, the parent is advised to monitor the child's respiratory status closely and seek immediate medical attention if symptoms worsen or fail to improve with prescribed therapy. The patient will also undergo spirometry testing during the follow-up visit to better evaluate lung function and guide future management.
