Clinic or Hospital Location: Muonio  

Severity Level: 3 (Urgent – stable, needs 2+ resources)  
Patient Gender: Female  
Patient Age: 23

Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with a primary complaint of acute abdominal pain, severe in nature, and accompanied by fever and nausea.

History of Present Illness (HPI):  
The patient, a 23-year-old female, reports the onset of her symptoms approximately 12 hours ago. She describes the pain as constant, sharp, and localized to the right lower quadrant of her abdomen, rated at 8/10 in severity. The pain radiates to her back and is associated with fever (101.5°F) and three episodes of non-bilious, non-bloody vomiting. She denies any urinary symptoms, changes in bowel habits, or recent trauma.

Physical Examination Findings:  
Vital signs: Temperature 101.5°F, heart rate 98/min, respiratory rate 16/min, blood pressure 120/78 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. General appearance is distressed but cooperative. Abdominal examination reveals guarding, rebound tenderness, and voluntary movement in the right lower quadrant. Murphy's sign is positive. Bowel sounds are hyperactive, and there is no rebound or flank tenderness. No costovertebral angle tenderness is noted.

Assessment / Diagnosis:  
Given the patient's presentation of acute abdominal pain in the right lower quadrant with fever, guarding, rebound tenderness, and Murphy's sign, along with hyperactive bowel sounds, a presumptive diagnosis of appendicitis is made. This assessment aligns with severity level 3 (urgent), as it requires prompt attention but does not present an immediate life-threatening situation.

Plan / Treatment:  
1. Admission for further evaluation and management of suspected appendicitis.
2. Intravenous fluid hydration to maintain blood pressure and address dehydration from vomiting.
3. Administration of intravenous antibiotics (ceftriaxone 250mg and metronidazole 500mg) as empiric treatment for possible perforation.
4. Pain management with IV acetaminophen 300mg.
5. Arrange for abdominal CT scan with contrast to confirm the diagnosis and assess for complications.
6. Consultation with a surgeon for potential appendectomy if imaging confirms appendicitis.

Follow-up Instructions:  
The patient will be closely monitored in the hospital setting. A decision regarding surgical intervention (appendectomy) will be made based on the CT scan results and clinical response to treatment. Postoperatively, she will require a follow-up appointment with both the primary care provider and surgeon within one week of discharge for wound inspection and removal of any drains if applicable. She should also schedule a follow-up visit with gastroenterology for evaluation of potential underlying causes of her symptoms, such as inflammatory bowel disease or celiac disease, given the acute presentation.
