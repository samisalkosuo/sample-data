Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient, a 10-year-old female, presents with acute abdominal pain and vomiting.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient reports experiencing sudden onset of severe epigastric pain radiating to the back, accompanied by non-bilious, non-blood vomiting for the past 2 hours. She denies any fever, diarrhea, or urinary symptoms. The pain is described as a constant, sharp ache, rated at 8/10 in intensity, and has not improved with over-the-counter antacids or hydration.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears distressed but is cooperative. Her vital signs are within normal limits except for mild tachycardia (heart rate 110 bpm). Abdominal examination reveals guarding and rebound tenderness in the epigastric region with no rebound or rigidity. Bowel sounds are hyperactive, and there is no organomegaly or masses palpated.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's age, presenting symptoms, and physical examination findings, a working diagnosis of acute appendicitis is considered. However, further diagnostic workup is required to confirm this suspicion.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will undergo an abdominal ultrasound and complete blood count (CBC) to support the clinical suspicion. She will be admitted for possible surgical intervention if the imaging and laboratory results are consistent with acute appendicitis. Pain management will be provided with intravenous fluids and morphine as needed.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be followed up by the surgical team post-imaging and laboratory evaluation. If the diagnosis of acute appendicitis is confirmed, she will require a surgical consult for potential appendectomy. For non-surgical cases, she will be discharged on clear liquid diet with gradual advancement based on tolerance. A follow-up appointment will be scheduled in 1 week to assess recovery and address any concerns.
