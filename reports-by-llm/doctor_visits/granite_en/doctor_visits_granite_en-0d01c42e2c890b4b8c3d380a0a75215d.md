Patient Gender: Male  
Patient Age: 7  

Severity Level: 5 (Non-urgent – minor complaints)

Chief Complaint: The patient, a 7-year-old male, presents with his mother for evaluation of a persistent cough and mild wheezing for the past 3 days.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient's mother reports that the child first developed a runny nose and low-grade fever 5 days ago, which resolved over the next 2 days. However, a persistent dry cough and occasional wheezing have since been noted. The symptoms are worse at night and with exertion. There is no known history of asthma or allergies in the family.

Physical Examination Findings: On examination, the patient appears well-nourished and in no acute distress. His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 84/min, respiratory rate is 18/min, and blood pressure is 102/60 mmHg. Auscultation of the lungs reveals bilateral whezing, more prominent in the lower lobes. The rest of the physical examination is unremarkable.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Based on the history and physical examination findings, the patient is diagnosed with acute bronchiolitis, likely of viral etiology.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be managed conservatively with supportive care, including increased fluid intake and warm mist humidification at home. A bronchodilator trial with albuterol via nebulizer has been initiated in the clinic. The patient will be reassessed in 24-48 hours if symptoms worsen or fail to improve.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient's mother is advised to monitor his respiratory status at home and return for follow-up if there is increased work of breathing, worsening wheezing, or failure to thrive. She should also contact the clinic if the child develops a fever or other concerning symptoms.
