Clinic or Hospital Location: Pälkäne  

Patient Gender: Male  
Patient Age: 13 years  

Severity Level: 5 (Non-urgent – minor complaints)

Chief Complaint: The patient, a 13-year-old male, presents with a 3-day history of intermittent abdominal pain and mild fever. He reports the discomfort as a dull ache in the lower right quadrant, exacerbated by movement and relieved with rest. The patient also mentions occasional nausea but no vomiting or diarrhea.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The symptoms began 3 days ago, starting with mild abdominal discomfort that gradually worsened over the next day. The patient reports a low-grade fever, typically around 38°C, without chills or sweating. He denies any recent trauma, changes in bowel habits, or urinary symptoms. The pain is not associated with food intake and does not radiate to other areas.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears well-developed for his age and in no acute distress. Vital signs are within normal limits. Abdominal examination reveals mild tenderness in the right lower quadrant with no rebound or guarding. Bowel sounds are present and normal. No organomegaly or masses are appreciated. The rest of the physical examination is unremarkable.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's age, presentation, and normal vital signs, a likely diagnosis is acute appendicitis with localized periumbilical pain and tenderness in the right lower quadrant. However, the severity of symptoms is not suggestive of a typical acute abdomen, and the absence of classic signs (e.g., fever, leukocytosis) makes alternative diagnoses such as mesenteric lymphadenitis or ovarian torsion less likely in this male patient.

Plan / Treatment: Given the non-urgent nature of the complaint and atypical presentation, further workup is recommended. Laboratory tests including complete blood count (CBC) with differential and C-reactive protein (CRP) will be ordered. Ultrasound of the abdomen is also advised to evaluate the appendix and rule out other potential causes. The patient will be prescribed over-the-counter pain relief as needed for symptomatic relief.

Follow-up Instructions: Please return to the clinic in 7 days for review of investigations and discussion of results. If symptoms worsen or new symptoms develop before this appointment, please seek immediate medical attention.
