Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with acute abdominal pain, severe nausea, and vomiting. She reports a sudden onset of symptoms approximately two hours ago.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient is a 34-year-old female who began experiencing sharp, constant abdominal pain in the lower quadrants, accompanied by severe nausea and non-bilious vomiting. She rates her pain as an 8/10 in intensity. There are no urinary symptoms, and she denies any fever or chills. The patient's last menstrual period was two weeks ago, and she uses intrauterine contraception (IUD).

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears distressed due to pain. Vital signs are as follows: temperature 37°C, heart rate 102 bpm, blood pressure 110/70 mmHg, and respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute. Abdominal examination reveals guarding, rebound tenderness, and mild distension in the lower abdomen. There is no costovertebral angle tenderness or rebound. Bowel sounds are hyperactive but present. No masses or organomegaly are appreciated.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's presentation, a working diagnosis of acute appendicitis is considered. The severity level is 2 (emergent) due to potential for appendicular perforation and subsequent peritonitis. Further diagnostic workup is required to confirm the diagnosis.

Plan / Treatment:
1. Admit the patient for further evaluation and management.
2. Order a focused abdominal ultrasound and complete blood count (CBC).
3. Administer intravenous fluids for hydration and pain management with IV diclofenac 75mg.
4. Consult surgery for possible urgent appendectomy if imaging and clinical findings support the diagnosis of acute appendicitis.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be followed up post-procedure or post-imaging studies, depending on the diagnostic results. If surgical intervention is required, she will be scheduled for a follow-up appointment in one week to remove sutures and assess healing.
