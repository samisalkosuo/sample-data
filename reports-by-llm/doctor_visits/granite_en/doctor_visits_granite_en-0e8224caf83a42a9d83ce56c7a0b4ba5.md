Visit Date: 22.06.2025  
Clinic or Hospital Location: Pori  

Patient Gender: Male  
Patient Age: 57  

Severity Level: 3 (Urgent â€“ stable, needs 2+ resources)

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with progressive dyspnea and chest discomfort of one-week duration.

History of Present Illness (HPI):  
The patient, a 57-year-old male, reports the onset of dyspnea at rest, initially noticed while performing light activities, which has gradually worsened over the past week. He describes the discomfort as a pressing sensation in his chest, exacerbated by exertion and relieved by rest. He denies any fever, night sweats, or recent weight loss. There is no significant past medical history of cardiovascular disease but he has a family history of coronary artery disease.

Physical Examination Findings:  
Vital signs: Blood pressure 140/90 mmHg, heart rate 95 bpm, respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation 92% on room air.  
General appearance: The patient appears anxious and in moderate distress.  
HEENT: Normocephalic, atraumatic. Pupils equal, round, and reactive to light. Oropharynx clear.  
Cardiovascular: Regular rhythm, S1 and S2 audible, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Bilateral fine crackles heard in lung bases.  
Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, non-distended. No organomegaly or masses.  
Extremities: No edema noted. Peripheral pulses intact and symmetric.

Assessment / Diagnosis:  
The patient's presentation is concerning for acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with possible congestive heart failure (CHF). The elevated blood pressure, tachycardia, and dyspnea at rest, alongside bilateral basal crackles on lung auscultation, suggest fluid overload.

Plan / Treatment:  
1. Administer 2 L/min supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula to maintain oxygen saturation above 90%.  
2. Initiate a course of systemic corticosteroids (prednisone 40 mg daily) for potential underlying inflammation contributing to acute exacerbation.  
3. Start loop diuretic therapy (furosemide 40 mg IV) to manage fluid overload and dyspnea.  
4. Obtain an EKG and order laboratory tests including complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, and D-dimer to evaluate for potential cardiac and pulmonary causes of his symptoms.  
5. Consult with a cardiologist for further evaluation and management.

Follow-up Instructions:  
The patient is scheduled for follow-up in the outpatient clinic in one week for reassessment of symptoms, review of laboratory results, and possible adjustment of therapy based on consultation with the cardiologist. He should avoid strenuous activity until then and continue current medications as prescribed. Instruct the patient to contact emergency services immediately if his condition worsens or he experiences new or severe symptoms before the follow-up appointment.
