Clinic or Hospital Location: Hailuoto  

Patient Gender: Male  
Patient Age: 9  

Severity Level: 2 (Emergent – potential life threat)

Chief Complaint: The patient, a 9-year-old male, presents with acute respiratory distress and increased work of breathing.

History of Present Illness (HPI):  
The patient's mother reports that the child has been experiencing progressive worsening dyspnea over the past 12 hours. Initially, the symptoms started with nasal congestion and a non-productive cough. Within the last 6 hours, the patient developed paroxysmal nasal flaring, intercostal retractions, and accessory muscle use. The child's oxygen saturation on room air is noted to be in the low 80s.

Physical Examination Findings:  
Vital signs: Temperature 98.6°F (37°C), Heart rate 120/min, Respiratory rate 45/min, Blood pressure 90/60 mmHg, Oxygen saturation 82% on room air.  
General appearance: The child appears anxious and in moderate respiratory distress.  
HEENT: Mild periorbital edema, conjunctival injection, and anterior rhinorrhea are noted. Tympanic membranes are intact bilaterally.  
Cardiovascular: Tachycardia with a regular rhythm. No murmurs, gallops, or rubs are appreciated.  
Respiratory: Increased respiratory rate and paroxysmal nasal flaring. Auscultation reveals bilateral wheezing throughout inspiration and expiration. Peripheral mucous rales are heard in the lung bases.  
Gastrointestinal and guarded abdomen with no masses or tenderness.  
Neurological: Alert and oriented to person, place, and time. No focal deficits.

Assessment / Diagnosis:  
The patient presents with signs of an acute asthma exacerbation, likely secondary to viral upper respiratory infection, given the recent onset of symptoms. The child's low oxygen saturation and severe respiratory distress indicate a need for immediate intervention.

Plan / Treatment:  
1. Administer 2 puffs of albuterol via nebulizer immediately.
2. Provide supplemental oxygen at a flow rate of 4 L/min via nasal cannula to maintain oxygen saturation above 90%.
3. Admit the patient for further management, including intravenous corticosteroids (e.g., methylprednisolone 1 mg/kg) and consideration of magnesium sulfate if there is no improvement within 60 minutes.
4. Obtain a chest X-ray to rule out pneumonia or other complications.
5. Start the patient on an antibiotic (e.g., amoxicillin) for possible secondary bacterial infection, pending culture results if obtained.
6. Provide parental education regarding asthma action plans and triggers.

Follow-up Instructions:  
Schedule a follow-up appointment within 48 hours post-discharge to assess response to treatment and adjust the management plan as necessary. Instruct parents to return immediately for any worsening respiratory symptoms or if the child's condition deteriorates.
