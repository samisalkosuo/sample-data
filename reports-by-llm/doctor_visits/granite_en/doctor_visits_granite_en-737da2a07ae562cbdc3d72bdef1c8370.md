Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with acute abdominal pain, severe cramping, and fever. She reports feeling unwell for the past 12 hours, with symptoms worsening over time.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient is a 29-year-old female who reports experiencing sudden onset of severe abdominal pain, rated as 8/10 in intensity. The pain is localized to the lower quadrants, radiating to the back. She also describes accompanying symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and low-grade fever (38.2°C). These symptoms began approximately 12 hours ago and have progressed in severity since then. The patient denies any recent trauma, changes in bowel habits, or urinary symptoms. She is currently taking no medications and has no known allergies.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears distressed due to pain. Vital signs are as follows: temperature 38.2°C, heart rate 105 bpm, respiratory rate 18 breaths/min, blood pressure 110/70 mmHg, and oxygen saturation 98% on room air. Abdominal examination reveals guarding, rebound tenderness, and mild rigidity in the lower quadrants. There is no rebound or percussion pain. Bowel sounds are hyperactive but present. No costovertebral angle tenderness is noted.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's presentation of acute abdominal pain with guarding, rebound tenderness, and fever, a differential diagnosis of appendicitis or a possible pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is considered. Further investigations are warranted to confirm the diagnosis.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will undergo an immediate abdominopelvic CT scan with contrast to evaluate for appendicitis or other intra-abdominal pathology. She will be started on intravenous fluids and pain management with morphine sulfate 2 mg every 3-4 hours as needed. Laboratory tests, including a complete blood count (CBC) and comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), will be ordered to assess for signs of infection or inflammation. If the CT scan confirms appendicitis, she will be referred to a surgeon for possible appendectomy.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient should return to the clinic within 48 hours for follow-up after the CT scan and laboratory results are available. If the diagnosis is confirmed as appendicitis or PID, she will need to be seen by a surgeon or gynecologist before discharge. In the meantime, she should rest and avoid solid foods until further evaluation.
