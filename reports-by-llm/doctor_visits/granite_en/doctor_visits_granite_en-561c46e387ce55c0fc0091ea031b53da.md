Visit Date: 22.12.2024  
Clinic or Hospital Location: Kinnula  

Patient Gender: Male  
Patient Age: 102  

Severity Level: 4 (Less-urgent â€“ stable, stable, 1 resource)

Chief Complaint: The patient, a 102-year-old male, presents for a routine follow-up visit regarding his longstanding history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He reports increased shortness of breath with minimal exertion over the past week.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient has a known history of COPD, managed with long-term budesonide/formoterol inhaler and occasional albuterol as needed for acute exacerbations. He denies any recent fevers, chills, or coughing up sputum. His symptoms have been progressively worsening over the past week, leading to increased anxiety and difficulty performing daily activities.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears well-nourished for his age but demonstrates mild respiratory distress with a respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation of 88% on room air. Auscultation reveals bilateral wheezing and prolonged expiratory phase. Cardiovascular examination shows regular rhythm with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. There is no peripheral edema, and the extremities are warm to touch.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Based on the patient's history and physical examination findings, he is experiencing a COPD exacerbation. His increased shortness of breath, use of accessory muscles, and decreased oxygen saturation suggest worsening airflow obstruction.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be initiated on a course of oral prednisolone 20mg daily for 5 days along with a short-acting bronchodilator (salbutamom) as needed for acute symptoms. He will continue his regular long-term COPD medications, including inhaled budesonide/formoterol. A referral to a pulmonologist for further evaluation and management is recommended.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient should return for a follow-up appointment in 2 weeks or sooner if symptoms worsen. He will be provided with instructions on recognizing signs of deterioration, such as increased shortness of breath, change in sputum color, or fever. Additionally, he will receive guidance on home oxygen therapy and proper inhaler technique to optimize his COPD management at home.
