Patient Age: 70

Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with a chief complaint of progressive dyspnea and lower extremity edema for the past two weeks.

History of Present Illness (HPI): A 70-year-old female reports a gradual onset of shortness of breath (dyspnea) while performing daily activities, which has worsened over the past fortnight. She also mentions bilateral lower extremity swelling (edema) that started around the same time. There is no history of chest pain, cough, or fever. The patient denies any recent weight changes but reports a noticeable increase in ring and shoe sizes.

Physical Examination Findings: On examination, the patient appears mildly distressed and is using accessory muscles for breathing. Vital signs are as follows: Blood pressure 140/90 mmHg, heart rate 95 bpm, respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation 92% on room air, and temperature 98.6Â°F. Cardiovascular examination reveals a regular rhythm but a III/VI holosystolic murmur heard best at the apex. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally with no wheezes or rhonchi. Abdominal examination is unremarkable, and there is no hepatosplenomegaly. Neurological examination is grossly intact. Lower extremities show pitting edema up to the knees bilaterally.

Assessment / Diagnosis: The patient's presentation of progressive dyspnea, lower extremity edema, and a new holosystolic murmur suggests possible heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFREF). Further diagnostic testing is warranted to confirm this suspicion.

Plan / Treatment:
1. Prescribe furosemide 20mg daily for diuresis and symptomatic relief of edema.
2. Schedule a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) to assess left ventricular function and ejection fraction.
3. Refer the patient to cardiology for further management and potential optimization of heart failure therapy.
4. Advise the patient to limit fluid intake and sodium consumption, and to monitor weight daily.

Follow-up Instructions: Please schedule a follow-up appointment in one week to reassess symptoms, review diagnostic test results, and adjust treatment as necessary. In the meantime, encourage the patient to contact our clinic if her condition worsens or if she experiences any new or concerning symptoms.
