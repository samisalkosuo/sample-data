Clinic or Hospital Location: Puumala  

Patient Gender: Male  
Patient Age: 79  

Severity Level: 4 (Less-urgent â€“ stable, 1 resource)

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with progressive dyspnea and lower extremity edema of one week's duration.

History of Present Illness (HPI): A 79-year-old male reports a one-week history of worsening shortness of breath, particularly with minimal exertion, and bilateral lower extremity swelling up to his knees. He denies any chest pain, cough, or fever. His symptoms began gradually and have steadily worsened since onset. He has a history of atrial fibrillation on anticoagulation therapy and well-controlled hypertension.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears mildly distressed but is in stable condition. Vital signs are within normal limits. Cardiovascular exam reveals regular rhythm with a rate of 80 bpm, no murmurs, and no rubs or gallops. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. There is mild bibasilar crackles. Jugular venous pressure is mildly elevated, and there is +2 lower extremity edema up to the knees. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and normoactive bowels. Neurological exam is grossly intact.

Assessment / Diagnosis: The patient's presentation is suggestive of congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation, likely secondary to poorly controlled atrial fibrillation. Further investigations including ECG and echocardiogram are recommended for confirmation and assessment of left ventricular function.

Plan / Treatment: Initiate treatment with intravenous furosemide 40mg, oral lisinopril 10mg daily, and oral digoxin 0.25mg daily. Monitor renal function closely due to potential for drug-induced hypotension. Arrange follow-up with a cardiologist for further management of atrial fibrillation and optimization of heart failure therapy.

Follow-up Instructions: Schedule an urgent appointment with the cardiologist within one week for comprehensive evaluation and management plan adjustment. Instruct the patient to present immediately if symptoms worsen or if he experiences new or different symptoms. Advise regular monitoring of weight at home, noting any significant fluctuations. Encourage a low-sodium diet and strict adherence to prescribed medications.
