Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with progressive dyspnea and a productive cough for the past two weeks. He reports increased shortness of breath at rest and orthopnea, which has led to significant sleep disturbance.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The 71-year-old male patient reports a two-week history of worsening dyspnea and a productive cough with white sputum. He denies any recent travel, sick contacts, or known allergies. His symptoms began gradually and have progressed to cause significant discomfort and sleep disturbance due to orthopnea. He has a history of hypertension and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) managed with inhalers.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears anxious and in moderate respiratory distress. Vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 140/90 mmHg, heart rate 105 bpm, respiratory rate 28 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation 88% on room air, and temperature 37.2°C. Auscultation reveals bilateral basal crackles and decreased breath sounds. Cardiovascular examination shows irregular heart rhythm with a rate of 105 bpm and no murmurs. There is no peripheral edema, and the extremities are warm.

Assessment / Diagnosis: The patient's presentation is consistent with an acute exacerbation of COPD, likely secondary to a lower respiratory tract infection. His increased work of breathing and hypoxemia necessitate further investigation and management.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be initiated on intravenous corticosteroids (methylprednisolone 40mg), antibiotics (ceftriaxone 2g), and bronchodilators (salbutamol nebulizer). Oxygen therapy via high-flow nasal cannula will be provided to maintain oxygen saturation above 90%. He will be closely monitored for clinical improvement. Laboratory investigations, including arterial blood gas analysis and complete blood count, will be arranged.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient should follow up with his primary care physician within one week for ongoing management of his COPD exacerbation. He should also schedule a follow-up appointment with the pulmonology department for further evaluation and management of his chronic condition. In the meantime, he must continue using his prescribed inhalers as directed and report any worsening symptoms immediately.
