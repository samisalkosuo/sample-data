Clinic or Hospital Location: Finström  

Patient Gender: Male  
Patient Age: 63  

Severity Level: 3 (Urgent – stable, needs 2+ resources)

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with progressive dyspnea and chest discomfort of one-week duration.

History of Present Illness (HPI):  
A 63-year-old male reports the onset of gradually worsening shortness of breath and a vague, intermittent chest discomfort over the past week. The symptoms are exacerbated with minimal exertion and improve slightly with rest. He denies any cough, hemoptysis, or fever. There is no significant past medical history of cardiovascular diseases but he has a history of smoking (30 pack-years) and recently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus managed with metformin.

Physical Examination Findings:  
Vital signs: Blood pressure 148/92 mmHg, heart rate 98 bpm, respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation 90% on room air.  
General appearance: The patient appears anxious and in moderate distress.  
HEENT: Normocephalic, atraumatic. Pupils equal, round, and reactive to light. Oropharynx clear.  
Cardiovascular: Regular rhythm, S1 and S2 audible, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Bilateral fine crackles heard in lung bases.  
Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, non-distended. No organomegaly or masses.  
Extremities: No edema noted. Peripheral pulses intact and symmetric.  

Assessment / Diagnosis:  
The patient's presentation is suggestive of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with possible concomitant heart failure, given his history of smoking, recent diabetes diagnosis, and current symptoms. Further diagnostic testing including chest X-ray and blood work (BNP, glucose, electrolytes) is recommended to confirm the diagnosis and assess severity.

Plan / Treatment:  
1. Immediate initiation of bronchodilators (albuterol via nebulizer) for acute dyspnea.
2. Prescription of systemic corticosteroids (prednisone 40 mg daily) to reduce airway inflammation.
3. Initiate diuretic therapy (furosemide 20 mg PO q12h) to manage potential fluid overload in heart failure.
4. Optimize glycemic control with metformin as prescribed.
5. Schedule a chest X-ray and laboratory tests (BNP, glucose, electrolytes) for further evaluation.
6. Referral to a pulmonologist and cardiologist for comprehensive management of COPD and possible heart failure.

Follow-up Instructions:  
The patient is scheduled for follow-up in one week at Finström Clinic for reassessment based on diagnostic test results and treatment response. He should return immediately if symptoms worsen or if he experiences new or severe symptoms before the scheduled appointment.
