Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient, an 11-year-old male, presents with a 3-day history of progressive difficulty breathing and increasing wheezing. He reports occasional coughing spells and mild chest tightness.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient's symptoms began approximately 3 days ago with a mild cough and have since progressed to include difficulty breathing, wheezing, and intermittent chest tightness. He denies fever, recent cold or flu-like symptoms, or any known allergies. The symptoms are worse at night and with exertion.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient is in moderate respiratory distress, breathing through an oxygen mask. Vital signs are as follows: temperature 98.6°F (37°C), heart rate 110 bpm, respiratory rate 28 breaths/min, blood pressure 110/70 mmHg, and oxygen saturation 92% on room air. Auscultation reveals bilateral wheezing throughout lung fields, with decreased breath sounds at the bases. Cardiovascular examination is unremarkable, with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops noted.

Assessment / Diagnosis: The patient's presentation is consistent with an acute exacerbation of asthma. He meets the criteria for severity level 4 due to his moderate respiratory distress and the need for intervention to control symptoms and improve airway function.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will receive a course of systemic corticosteroids (prednisolone 2 mg/kg for 5 days) and a short-acting beta-agonist (albutiol) via nebulizer every 4 hours as needed for bronchospasm relief. He will also receive a course of inhaled corticosteroids (budesonide) for long-term asthma management. The patient's parent/guardian will be provided with an action plan for future asthma exacerbations and instructions on proper inhaler technique.

Follow-up Instructions: Schedule a follow-up appointment within one week to reassess the patient's respiratory status, review the action plan, and discuss long-term asthma management strategies. The patient should return immediately if symptoms worsen or fail to improve with treatment.
