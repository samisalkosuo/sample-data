Clinic or Hospital Location: Kustavi  

Patient Gender: Female  
Patient Age: 63  

Severity Level: 4 (Less-urgent â€“ stable, stable, 1 resource)

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with a persistent cough and progressive shortness of breath for the past two weeks. She also reports intermittent chest pain and occasional wheezing.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 63-year-old female, reports the onset of her symptoms approximately two weeks ago. Initially, she experienced a dry cough that has since become productive with yellowish sputum. Over the past few days, she has noticed increasing shortness of breath, particularly during exertion and at night. She describes the chest pain as sharp, intermittent, and worsening with deep inspiration. The patient denies any recent travel, sick contacts, or known allergies. Her past medical history is significant for well-controlled hypertension and mild asthma.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears comfortable but slightly anxious. Vital signs are within normal limits except for a respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute. Auscultation reveals bilateral wheezing and decreased breath sounds in the lower lobes. Percussion note is dull, and vocal resonance is hyper-resonant, suggesting possible consolidation. There are no other significant findings on general inspection or systemic examination.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Based on the patient's history, physical examination, and symptoms, she is likely suffering from a lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) with possible superimposed acute exacerbation of her mild asthma. Further investigations, including chest X-ray and sputum culture, are recommended to confirm the diagnosis and guide treatment.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be started on a course of oral antibiotics (Amoxicillin-Clavulanate 625mg BID for 7 days) to cover common respiratory pathogens. She will also receive inhaled short-acting bronchodilators (Albuterol as needed for pronounced symptoms). The patient will be advised to use a spacer device with her inhaler for better drug deposition. She should continue her maintenance asthma medications (Inhaled Corticosteroid and Long-acting Beta Agonist) as prescribed. The patient will be scheduled for a chest X-ray and sputum culture today.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient is advised to follow up in one week or sooner if symptoms worsen, she develops fever, or her condition does not improve. She should also seek immediate medical attention if she experiences severe chest pain, bluish discoloration of lips or nail beds (cyanosis), or difficulty breathing at rest.
