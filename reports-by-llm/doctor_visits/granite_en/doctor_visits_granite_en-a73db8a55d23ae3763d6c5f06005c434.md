Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with a three-day history of progressive dyspnea and chest discomfort.

History of Present Illness (HPI): A 63-year-old female reports the onset of symptoms three days ago, initially experiencing shortness of breath with mild exertion. Over the past 48 hours, her symptoms have worsened, now occurring at rest and associated with a sharp, pleuritic chest pain that worsens with deep inspiration and coughing. She denies any fever, chills, or night sweats. She has a history of hypertension and smoking (30 pack-years quit 15 years ago).

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears anxious but is in stable condition. Vital signs are within normal limits. Auscultation reveals decreased breath sounds on the right lower lung field with occasional crackles. Percussion elicits dullness, and there is increased tactile fremitus over the right lung fields. No wheezing or prolonged expiration is noted. The remaining physical examination is unremarkable.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Based on the patient's history, physical examination findings, and considering her age, smoking history, and current symptoms, a working diagnosis of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with possible right-sided pneumonia is made. Further diagnostic testing, including chest X-ray and blood work, will be pursued to confirm this assessment.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will receive a course of intravenous antibiotics (Ceftriaxone 500mg once daily) targeting common respiratory pathogens in smokers with COPD. She will also receive inhaled bronchodilators (Salbutamol and Ipratropium) as needed for dyspnea relief. Oxygen therapy via nasal cannula at 2L/min has been initiated to maintain oxygen saturation above 90%. She will be closely monitored for clinical improvement and potential need for further interventions, such as chest physiotherapy or possible admission for closer monitoring and treatment.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient is advised to follow up in the outpatient clinic within one week for a review of her condition and to ensure appropriate tapering of antibiotics. She should also schedule a pulmonary function test and a follow-up appointment with a pulmonologist for further management of her COPD. In the interim, she must continue monitoring her symptoms and report any worsening or new complications immediately.
