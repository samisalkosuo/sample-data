Severity Level: 2 (Emergent – potential life threat)
Patient Gender: Male
Patient Age: 94

Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient, a 94-year-old male, presents with acute onset confusion and disorientation, reported by his caregiver. He has also experienced a sudden decline in oral intake and increased lethargy over the past 24 hours.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient's caregiver reports that he has been progressively more confused since yesterday, with difficulty following simple commands and orienting to person, place, and time. He has also shown a significant decrease in his usual oral intake, consuming only small amounts of liquids. The patient's lethargy has increased, with minimal verbalization and reduced movement. There is no history of recent falls, head injuries, or fever.

Physical Examination Findings: On examination, the patient appears alert but confused, with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 12 (Eye opening: 4, Verbal response: 3, Motor response: 5). Vital signs are within normal limits for age. Cardiovascular and respiratory examinations reveal no acute distress. Abdominal examination is unremarkable, with no tenderness or organomegaly. Neurological examination shows no focal deficits.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's age, acute onset confusion, decreased oral intake, and lethargy, a differential diagnosis of delirium, urinary tract infection (UTI), or medication side effects is considered. Further investigations are required to rule out these possibilities.

Plan / Treatment:
1. Complete blood count (CBC) with differential, comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), and urinalysis to evaluate for infection or electrolyte imbalances.
2. Urine culture to rule out UTI.
3. Review of current medications for potential side effects contributing to confusion.
4. Consultation with the geriatric team for further evaluation and management.
5. Close monitoring for any changes in mental status or neurological symptoms.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be followed up in 24-48 hours with the results of laboratory investigations. If no underlying cause is identified, a geriatric consultation will be arranged for further evaluation and management. The caregiver should monitor the patient's confusion, oral intake, and lethargy closely and report any changes immediately.
