Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient, a 9-year-old female, presents with acute abdominal pain and vomiting.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient reports experiencing sudden onset of severe epigastric pain radiating to the back, accompanied by non-bilious, non-blood vomiting for the past 2 hours. The pain is described as a constant, sharp ache, rated at 8/10 in intensity. She denies any fever, diarrhea, or urinary symptoms. The symptoms began while playing outdoors and have progressively worsened since.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears distressed due to pain. Her vital signs are within normal limits except for a mild tachycardia of 120 bpm. Abdominal examination reveals guarding and rebound tenderness in the epigastric region with no rebound or rigidity. Bowel sounds are hyperactive, and there is no evidence of peritoneal signs. The rest of the physical examination is unremarkable.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's age, acute onset of severe epigastric pain with guarding and rebound tenderness, a differential diagnosis of appendicitis or mesenteric lymphadenitis is considered. Further investigations are warranted to confirm the diagnosis.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be admitted for further evaluation. Initial management includes intravenous fluids and pain control with morphine. Blood tests, including a complete blood count (CBC) and C-reactive protein (CRP), will be ordered along with an abdominal ultrasound or computed tomography (CT) scan if indicated. Surgical consultation is recommended for potential appendicectomy.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the pediatric ward. A follow-up appointment will be scheduled once the diagnostic tests are completed and a definitive diagnosis is established. Parents will be updated on the findings and management plan.
