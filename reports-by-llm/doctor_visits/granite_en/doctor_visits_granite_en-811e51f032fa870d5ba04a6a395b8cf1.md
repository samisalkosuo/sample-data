Clinic or Hospital Location: Rantasalmi  

Severity Level: 4  
Patient Gender: Male  
Patient Age: 79

Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with progressive dyspnea and a productive cough for the past week. He reports increased shortness of breath at rest and orthopnea, which has led to significant sleep disturbance.

History of Present Illness (HPI):  
The 79-year-old male patient reports the onset of his symptoms approximately one week ago, initially presenting with a dry cough and mild fatigue. Over the past few days, he has developed a productive cough with yellowish sputum, worsening dyspnea at rest, and orthopnea, requiring multiple pillows to sleep comfortably. He denies any chest pain, fever, or chills. His recent activity level has decreased due to shortness of breath. He has a history of hypertension, well-controlled on lisinopril 10mg daily, and mild chronic kidney disease (stage 3). He is a lifelong non-smoker.

Physical Examination Findings:  
Vital signs: Blood pressure 140/80 mmHg, heart rate 95 bpm, respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation 88% on room air.  
General appearance: The patient appears anxious and in moderate distress due to dyspnea.  
HEENT: Normocephalic, atraumatic. Pupils equal, round, and reactive to light. Oropharynx clear.  
Cardiovascular: Regular rhythm, S1 and S2 audible. No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  
Lungs: Decreased breath sounds bilaterally with bibasilar crackles.  
Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, no organomegaly.  
Extremities: No edema.  

Assessment / Diagnosis:  
The patient's presentation is consistent with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), likely precipitated by a lower respiratory tract infection. His increased dyspnea, productive cough, and worsening oxygenation suggest an acute decompensation of his underlying COPD.

Plan / Treatment:  
1. Prescribe albuterol inhaler (2 puffs qid prn) for bronchodilation.
2. Initiate a 5-day course of azithromycin 500mg on day 1, then 250mg for days 2-5 for suspected bacterial pneumonia.
3. Instruct the patient to use a cool-mist humidifier in his bedroom.
4. Schedule a follow-up appointment in one week for reassessment.
5. Refer the patient for pulmonary function testing and consider referral to a pulmonologist for further management, given the severity of his exacerbation.

Follow-up Instructions:  
The patient is advised to return for a follow-up appointment in one week or sooner if symptoms worsen. He should monitor his oxygen saturation levels at home using a pulse oximeter and contact the clinic immediately if his oxygen levels drop below 85% on room air. He should also continue daily spirometry as previously taught and maintain good hydration.
