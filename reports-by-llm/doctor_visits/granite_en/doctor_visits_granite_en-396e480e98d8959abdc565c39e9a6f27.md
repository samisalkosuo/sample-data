Clinic or Hospital Location: Nurmijärvi  

Patient Gender: Male  
Patient Age: 20  

Severity Level: 4 (Less-urgent – stable, stable, 1 resource)

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with a persistent cough and low-grade fever for the past five days. He also reports mild shortness of breath and intermittent chest pain.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient is a 20-year-old male who started experiencing a dry cough, low-grade fever (up to 38°C), and mild dyspnea approximately five days ago. He initially attributed these symptoms to a common viral upper respiratory tract infection but has not improved. The chest pain is described as sharp, intermittent, and worsening with deep breaths or coughing. There are no known allergies, recent travel, or sick contacts.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears well-groomed but slightly anxious. Vital signs are within normal limits: blood pressure 120/78 mmHg, heart rate 84 bpm, respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, temperature 37.2°C, and oxygen saturation 98% on room air. Auscultation of the lungs reveals decreased breath sounds in the right lower lobe with occasional crackles. The rest of the physical examination is unremarkable.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's age, history, and current symptoms, a working diagnosis of pneumonia (likely viral etiology) is considered. Further investigations such as chest X-ray and possible respiratory viral panel may be warranted to confirm this suspicion.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be started on a five-day course of azithromycin 500mg on day 1, followed by 250mg for the next four days, as empiric treatment for possible bacterial pneumonia. He will also receive instructions on symptomatic relief measures such as hydration and over-the-counter analgesics for pain management. A follow-up appointment is scheduled in one week to reassess his condition. If symptoms worsen or do not improve, further investigations including a chest X-ray and respiratory viral panel will be pursued.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient should return for a follow-up visit in one week to assess response to treatment and ensure resolution of symptoms. If there is no improvement or if symptoms worsen (e.g., increased dyspnea, persistent fever, or chest pain), he should seek immediate medical attention. He should also contact the clinic if he develops any new or concerning symptoms before the follow-up appointment.
