Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient, a 79-year-old female, presents with a chief complaint of progressive fatigue and mild shortness of breath over the past two weeks. She also reports occasional dizziness upon standing.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient has been experiencing gradual onset of fatigue, rating 7/10 in severity, which has been worsening over the past fortnight. She describes the fatigue as a persistent, non-refreshing tiredness that limits her daily activities. The shortness of breath is mild, occurring with moderate exertion, and is rated 4/10 in severity. She also mentions experiencing episodes of dizziness upon standing, lasting less than a minute, over the past week. There are no associated chest pains, cough, or fever.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears her stated age and is in moderate distress due to fatigue. Vital signs are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated heart rate of 90 bpm and a blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, with no wheezing or rhonchi. Cardiovascular exam reveals a regular rhythm with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and normoactive bowel sounds are heard. Neurological examination is unremarkable, except for a positive postural blood pressure drop of 20/10 mmHg, suggesting orthostatic hypotension.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's age, presentation of progressive fatigue, mild shortness of breath, and orthostatic hypotension, a working diagnosis of possible anemia or an undiagnosed chronic condition contributing to her symptoms is considered. Further investigations are recommended to rule out any underlying pathology.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will undergo a complete blood count (CBC) and comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) to evaluate for anemia or other metabolic abnormalities. She will also be referred to a cardiologist for further evaluation of her orthostatic hypotension, including possible tilt table testing. In the interim, she is advised to maintain hydration and avoid prolonged standing.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient should return in two weeks for a follow-up appointment to review the results of laboratory tests and discuss any necessary referrals or further management plans. She is also encouraged to contact the clinic if her symptoms worsen before the scheduled follow-up.
