2. Order lab tests: Complete Blood Count (CBC), Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP), Lipase, Amylase, Urinalysis, and pregnancy test (if applicable).
3. Obtain an abdominal CT scan with contrast to assess for any obstruction or organic pathology.
4. Administer intravenous fluids for hydration and pain management with IV meperidine 50mg as needed.
5. Consult a surgical specialist for potential endoscopic or surgical intervention if the CT scan reveals an obstruction or other concerning findings.

Follow-up Instructions:  
The patient will be closely monitored in the hospital setting. The surgical consult will provide further recommendations based on imaging results and clinical course. A follow-up appointment will be scheduled upon discharge for ongoing management and dietary counseling to prevent recurrence.
