Visit Date: 03.10.2023  
Clinic or Hospital Location: Lohja  

Patient Gender: Female  
Patient Age: 43  

Severity Level: 3 (Urgent – stable, needs 2+ resources)

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with a persistent cough, shortness of breath, and intermittent chest pain for the past two weeks. She reports increased symptoms over the last 48 hours, leading to her current urgent visit.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient is a 43-year-old female who has been experiencing a dry cough, intermittent chest tightness, and progressive shortness of breath for approximately two weeks. She reports that the symptoms have worsened over the past 48 hours, with increased frequency of coughing fits and difficulty breathing at rest. She denies fever, chills, or night sweats but mentions occasional mild wheezing audible during auscultation. The patient has no significant past medical history, is a non-smoker, and has no known allergies.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears mildly distressed but is in stable condition. Her vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 130/80 mmHg, heart rate 95 bpm, respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, temperature 98.6°F (37°C), and oxygen saturation 94% on room air. Auscultation reveals bilateral basal crackles and mild wheezing throughout lung fields. Cardiovascular examination shows normal heart rhythm with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and bowel sounds are present. Extremities show no edema, and peripheral pulses are strong bilaterally. Neurological examination is unremarkable.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Based on the patient's presentation, physical examination findings, and recent exacerbation of symptoms, she is likely experiencing a moderate to severe exacerbation of her underlying asthma. Further investigations, such as spirometry and chest X-ray, may be warranted to confirm this diagnosis and rule out alternative causes like pneumonia or heart failure.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will receive a course of high-dose inhaled corticosteroids (e.g., budesonide 800 mcg/day) along with a short-acting beta-agonist (SABA) for immediate relief (e.g., albuterol as needed). She will also be provided with a written action plan for asthma management, including the use of her rescue inhaler and instructions on avoiding triggers. The patient is advised to follow up within one week for reassessment and to schedule regular follow-ups every 3 months for ongoing asthma management.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient should return for a follow-up appointment in one week to assess her response to treatment and adjust the management plan as needed. In the interim, she must adhere to her prescribed medication regimen, monitor her symptoms closely, and contact the clinic if there are any worsening or new symptoms. She should also avoid known asthma triggers and maintain open communication regarding any concerns or questions.
