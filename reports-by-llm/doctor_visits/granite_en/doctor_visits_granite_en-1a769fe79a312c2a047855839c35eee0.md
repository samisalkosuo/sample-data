Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient, a 4-year-old male, was brought in by his parents due to a persistent high fever and difficulty breathing for the past 3 days.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient's mother reports that the child developed a high fever approximately 72 hours ago, initially reaching up to 40.5°C (104.9°F). The fever has been intermittent but persistent, with fluctuations between 39.5°C (103.1°F) and 40.2°C (104.3°F). Over the past 2 days, the child has exhibited increased respiratory distress, characterized by nasal flaring, retractions, and intermittent coughing. The parents also mention that the child has been less active and has had decreased oral intake.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient is alert but appears uncomfortable. His vital signs are as follows: temperature 39.8°C (103.6°F), heart rate 140 beats per minute, respiratory rate 52 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 92% on room air. The patient's mucous membranes are dry, and his skin is warm and flushed. Auscultation of the lungs reveals bilateral wheezing and decreased breath sounds in the lower lobes. Cardiovascular examination shows tachycardia with no murmurs or gallops. The abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended with active bowel sounds. Neurological examination is unremarkable.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's age, persistent high fever, respiratory distress, bilateral wheezing, and tachycardia, a working diagnosis of bronchiolitis is made. Further investigations, such as a chest X-ray, may be considered to rule out pneumonia or other complications.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be started on supportive care, including oxygen therapy via nasal cannula to maintain oxygen saturation above 92%. Intravenous fluids will be administered for hydration. Albuterol nebulizer treatments will be given every 4 hours as needed for bronchospasm relief. The patient will also receive acetaminophen for fever reduction and discomfort. Parents are advised to continue monitoring the child's respiratory status at home and return immediately if there is any further deterioration.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient should be reassessed in 24-48 hours or sooner if symptoms worsen. The parents will be provided with a follow-up appointment for further evaluation and management, as needed. They will also receive instructions on home care, including humidification, hydration, and fever management.
