30.04.2024, Maarianhamina Clinic Visit Report

Chief Complaint: A 5-year-old female patient presents with a 2-day history of fever, refusal to eat, and increased irritability.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient's mother reports that her daughter developed a high fever (39.4°C) approximately 48 hours ago, which has persisted despite over-the-counter fever reducers. The child has been lethargic, refused all food and drinks, and exhibits increased irritability, often crying without an apparent reason. There are no known recent illness contacts or travel history.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears febrile with a temperature of 39.2°C. She is alert but lethargic, with poor eye contact. Her skin is warm and slightly flushed, with no rashes noted. Auscultation reveals bilateral sparse, wheezes in the lower lung fields. Heart rate is 120 bpm, regular, and blood pressure is 90/55 mmHg. Abdominal examination is unremarkable with no tenderness or organomegaly noted.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's age, fever, lethargy, irritability, and respiratory findings, a working diagnosis of acute viral upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) with possible complication such as secondary bacterial otitis media is considered. The severity level is rated as 2 due to the potential for rapid deterioration requiring prompt medical attention.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be started on intravenous fluids to address mild hypovolemia and prescribed an age-appropriate antibiotic (e.g., Amoxicillin) for suspected secondary bacterial otitis media, pending culture results. Additionally, she will receive a single dose of ibuprofen for fever reduction and discomfort. The patient's mother is advised to monitor her child's symptoms closely and return immediately if there are any signs of worsening respiratory distress or failure to improve within 48 hours.

Follow-up Instructions: Please return to the clinic in 48 hours for a follow-up visit, or sooner if the patient's condition worsens. The mother should also contact the clinic if she notices any new symptoms or if the current ones do not improve.
