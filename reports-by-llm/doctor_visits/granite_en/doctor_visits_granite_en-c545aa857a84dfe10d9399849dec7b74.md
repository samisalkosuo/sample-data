Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with acute onset of severe chest pain and shortness of breath.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 40-year-old female, reports experiencing sudden onset of intense, crushing chest pain radiating to her left arm, accompanied by severe dyspnea, approximately 30 minutes prior to arrival. She describes the pain as the worst she has ever experienced, scoring 10 out of 10 on the pain scale. There is no known history of coronary artery disease or other significant medical conditions.

Physical Examination Findings: The patient appears anxious and in distress. Her vital signs reveal a blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg, heart rate of 130 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 90% on room air, and temperature of 37Â°C. Cardiovascular examination reveals irregular heart rhythm with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended. Extremities show no edema, and peripheral pulses are intact. Neurological examination is unremarkable.

Assessment / Diagnosis: The patient's presentation is highly suggestive of an acute coronary syndrome, likely an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Given the severity and nature of her symptoms, immediate cardiac catheterization is warranted to confirm diagnosis and guide potential intervention.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be immediately transferred to a nearby cardiac catheterization laboratory for emergent diagnostic procedures. Pre-procedure medications include aspirin 300 mg, clopidogrel 600 mg, and heparin according to protocol. Oxygen therapy via non-rebreather mask will be administered during transport.

Follow-up Instructions: Following the cardiac catheterization, the patient will be closely monitored in the coronary care unit (CCU) for any complications. Further management and follow-up will be determined based on the results of the diagnostic procedures and consultation with a cardiologist. The patient's primary care provider will be notified of her admission and progress.
