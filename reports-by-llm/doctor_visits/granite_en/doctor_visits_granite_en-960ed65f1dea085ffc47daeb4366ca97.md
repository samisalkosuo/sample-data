Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with progressive dyspnea and chest discomfort of one-week duration.

History of Present Illness (HPI): A 66-year-old male reports a one-week history of worsening shortness of breath (dyspnea) and chest discomfort. The symptoms are exacerbated with minimal exertion and improve slightly with rest. He denies any cough, hemoptysis, or fever. There is no known history of cardiovascular disease, but he has a past medical history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus well-controlled on medications.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears mildly distressed with a respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation of 90% on room air. Auscultation reveals bilateral basal crackles. Cardiovascular examination shows regular rhythm with a blood pressure of 150/90 mmHg and no murmurs. There is no peripheral edema noted.

Assessment / Diagnosis: The patient's presentation is suggestive of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), likely precipitated by a possible respiratory infection. Further investigations, including chest X-ray and blood tests, are recommended to confirm the diagnosis and assess for complications.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be initiated on a course of intravenous corticosteroids (methylprednisolone 40mg qd) and broad-spectrum antibiotics (ceftriaxone 2g q12h). He will also receive bronchodilators (salbutamol nebulizer q4h prn) for symptomatic relief. Oxygen therapy via non-rebreather mask has been initiated to maintain oxygen saturation above 92%. Close monitoring is advised, and the patient will be admitted for further management and observation.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient should follow up with his primary care physician within one week post-discharge for ongoing management of COPD and review of medications. He may also require a referral to a pulmonologist for specialized care. In the interim, he must adhere to prescribed medication regimen, avoid known triggers, and maintain regular follow-up appointments as scheduled.
