Clinic or Hospital Location: Juuka  

Severity Level: 2  
Patient Gender: Male  
Patient Age: 5 years old  

Chief Complaint: The patient, a 5-year-old male, presents with a 3-day history of fever, difficulty breathing, and increased respiratory rate. His mother reports that he has also been lethargic and less interactive than usual.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient's symptoms began approximately 3 days ago with an elevated temperature of up to 40째C (104째F), measured at home. Over the past 2 days, he has exhibited increased respiratory effort, with a respiratory rate of 40 breaths per minute and nasal flaring. The patient's mother also mentions that he has been less responsive and prefers to lie quietly instead of engaging in his usual activities.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient is alert but appears lethargic. His vital signs are as follows: temperature 40째C (104째F), heart rate 130 beats per minute, respiratory rate 42 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation 92% on room air, and blood pressure 85/55 mmHg. The patient's mucous membranes are dry, and his skin is warm and flushed. Auscultation of the lungs reveals bilateral wheezing and decreased breath sounds in the lower lobes. Cardiovascular examination shows tachycardia with a regular rhythm and no murmurs. The abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended with active bowel sounds. Neurological examination is unremarkable except for mild confusion.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Based on the patient's presentation, history, and physical examination findings, he is diagnosed with a moderate to severe viral upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) complicated by acute bronchiolitis. The patient's tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypoxemia suggest respiratory distress secondary to airway narrowing from inflammation and mucus accumulation.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be started on intravenous fluids for hydration and treatment with nebulized bronchodilators (e.g., albuterol) to help open the airways. He will also receive a course of oral corticosteroids (e.g., prednisolone) to reduce airway inflammation. The patient's temperature and respiratory status will be closely monitored during his hospital stay. If there is no improvement in his condition, further investigations such as chest X-ray and possible admission to a pediatric ward may be necessary.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient should have a follow-up appointment within 48 hours of discharge or sooner if his respiratory status deteriorates. His mother will be provided with instructions on managing his symptoms at home, including the use of a cool-mist humidifier and ensuring adequate hydration. She should also contact the clinic immediately if the patient's condition worsens or if new symptoms develop.
