Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with acute abdominal pain, severe nausea, and vomiting. She reports a history of similar episodes but this time the symptoms are more intense and prolonged.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient is a 33-year-old female who has been experiencing intermittent abdominal pain for the past two weeks. However, today she reports an acute onset of severe, constant, sharp abdominal pain localized to the right lower quadrant. This is accompanied by non-bilious vomiting and inability to retain any oral intake due to severe nausea. She denies any fever, chills, or diarrhea. The pain started approximately six hours ago and has been progressively worsening.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears distressed and in moderate discomfort. Vital signs are within normal limits except for a mild tachycardia of 105 bpm. Abdominal examination reveals guarding, rebound tenderness, and voluntary levocation in the right lower quadrant. Murphy's sign is positive. Bowel sounds are hyperactive but not distended. No costovertebral angle tenderness or masses are noted.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's presentation of localized, severe abdominal pain with guarding, rebound tenderness, and Murphy's sign, along with a history suggestive of appendicitis, the working diagnosis is acute appendicitis. This is considered an emergent condition requiring prompt intervention to prevent potential complications such as perforation or peritonitis.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be referred immediately for a CT scan of the abdomen with contrast to confirm the diagnosis and assess for any complications. If the CT confirms acute appendicitis, emergency appendectomy is recommended. In the interim, she will receive intravenous fluids for hydration and pain management with IV diclofenac.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient should return to the clinic within 48 hours post-CT scan for review of results and discussion of surgical options. If the CT is negative or suggests alternative diagnoses, further investigations will be arranged accordingly. In either case, she will need to follow up with a gastroenterologist if necessary.
