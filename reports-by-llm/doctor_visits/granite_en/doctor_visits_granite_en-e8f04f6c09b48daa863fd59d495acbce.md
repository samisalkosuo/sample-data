Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient, a 69-year-old female, presents with progressive dyspnea and lower extremity edema of one week's duration.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient reports a gradual onset of shortness of breath at rest, which has worsened over the past week. She describes her symptoms as worse with minimal exertion and occupying most of her daily activities. Additionally, she notes bilateral lower extremity swelling, primarily in the ankles and feet, which is notable for being new and progressive. There is no history of chest pain, cough, or fever.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears mildly distressed and diaphoretic. Vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 150/90 mmHg, heart rate 102 bpm, respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation 88% on room air, and temperature 98.6Â°F. Cardiovascular exam reveals a regular rhythm but tachycardia with a third heart sound and mild S3 gallop. Lungs are bilaterally diffusely crackles. Lower extremities show 2+ pitting edema up to the knees. No peripheral adenopathy is noted.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's age, progressive dyspnea, tachycardia, and lower extremity edema, a likely diagnosis of congestive heart failure exacerbation is made. Further evaluation with an echocardiogram and BNP levels is recommended to confirm and assess the severity of cardiac dysfunction.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be started on intravenous furosemide 40mg, oral torsemide 10mg daily, and lisinopril 5mg daily for management of her symptoms. She will also receive supplemental oxygen as needed to maintain oxygen saturation above 90%. The patient will be referred to a cardiologist for further evaluation and management.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient should follow up with her primary care provider in one week for reassessment of symptoms and response to treatment. She should also schedule an appointment with the cardiologist within the next two weeks as recommended. In the meantime, she should monitor her weight daily and report any worsening symptoms or new complaints immediately.
