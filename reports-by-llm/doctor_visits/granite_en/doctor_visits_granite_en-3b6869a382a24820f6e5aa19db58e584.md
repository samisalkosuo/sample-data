Clinic or Hospital Location: Jämijärvi  

Patient Gender: Female  
Patient Age: 90  

Severity Level: 5 (Non-urgent – minor complaints)

Chief Complaint: The patient, a 90-year-old female, presents with a chief complaint of progressive fatigue and mild shortness of breath during daily activities. She also reports occasional dizziness upon standing.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient has been experiencing gradual onset of fatigue over the past month, which has been worsening in the last week. She describes the shortness of breath as mild and only noticeable during moderate exertion, such as climbing stairs or carrying groceries. The patient also mentions occasional episodes of dizziness upon standing, usually lasting a few seconds, which have been occurring for the past two weeks. She denies any chest pain, cough, or fever. Her past medical history is significant for hypertension, osteoarthritis, and mild chronic kidney disease.

Physical Examination Findings: On examination, the patient appears a well-nourished elderly female in no acute distress. Vital signs are within normal limits. Cardiovascular exam reveals regular rhythm and rate, with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended with no organomegaly. Extensive musculoskeletal examination shows mild joint tenderness in the knees consistent with osteoarthritis. Neurological examination is unremarkable, except for mild postural hypotension upon standing.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's age, past medical history, and current symptoms, a working diagnosis of orthostatic hypotension contributing to her dizziness and fatigue is made. The progressive fatigue could also be related to anemia, which should be investigated further with laboratory tests.

Plan / Treatment: 

1. Order complete blood count (CBC) to evaluate for anemia.
2. Recommend increasing fluid and salt intake to help manage orthostatic hypotension.
3. Advise the patient to avoid prolonged standing and engage in regular, gentle exercises as tolerated to improve cardiovascular fitness.
4. Schedule a follow-up appointment in four weeks for review of laboratory results and symptom status.

Follow-up Instructions: Please return in four weeks for a follow-up visit to review the CBC results and assess the effectiveness of the recommended lifestyle modifications. If symptoms worsen or new complaints arise before this appointment, please contact our clinic for further evaluation.
