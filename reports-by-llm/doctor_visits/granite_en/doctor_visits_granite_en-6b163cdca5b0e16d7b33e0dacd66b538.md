Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient, a 98-year-old female, presents with a chief complaint of general malaise and mild shortness of breath. She reports feeling more tired than usual and experiencing occasional difficulty catching her breath, especially during exertion.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient denies any chest pain, cough, or fever. She has a history of hypertension, osteoarthritis, and mild chronic kidney disease, all well-controlled with medication. The symptoms began approximately two weeks ago and have gradually worsened. She reports no recent changes in her medication regimen or significant life stressors.

Physical Examination Findings: On examination, the patient appears alert and oriented to person, place, and time. Vital signs are within normal limits for age, including blood pressure of 130/70 mmHg, heart rate of 72 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and temperature of 98.6°F. Lungs reveal mild bibasilar crackles bilaterally, and cardiovascular examination shows regular rhythm with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended, with no organomegaly. Extremities show no edema, and peripheral pulses are 2+ and symmetric. Neurological examination is unremarkable.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's age, medical history, and current symptoms, a likely diagnosis of congestive heart failure exacerbation with associated dyspnea is considered. The mild bibasilar crackles on lung auscultation support this assessment.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be started on oral furosemide 25mg daily for diuresis, with close monitoring of weight and renal function. She will also receive a prescription for torsemide 3.75mg once daily as an alternative if needed. Lisinopril 5mg daily will be continued for hypertension management. The patient will be advised to follow up in two weeks or sooner if symptoms worsen.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient is scheduled for a follow-up appointment in two weeks for reassessment of her condition. She should contact the clinic immediately if she experiences worsening dyspnea, increased fatigue, or any new or unusual symptoms. She will also receive instructions on monitoring her weight at home and reporting significant changes to the healthcare team.
