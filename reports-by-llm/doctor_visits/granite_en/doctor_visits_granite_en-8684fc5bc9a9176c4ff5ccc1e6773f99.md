Clinic or Hospital Location: Koski Tl  

Patient Gender: Male  
Patient Age: 81  

Severity Level: 4 (Less-urgent â€“ stable, stable, 1 resource)

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with progressive dyspnea and a productive cough for the past two weeks. He reports increased shortness of breath with minimal exertion and occasional wheezing.

History of Present Illness (HPI): An 81-year-old male presents with a two-week history of worsening dyspnea and a productive cough with white phlegm. The symptoms began gradually and have progressively worsened, leading to noticeable orthopnea and occasional paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. He denies any chest pain, fever, or hemoptysis. His past medical history is significant for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus. He is currently on long-term home oxygen therapy and takes inhaled budesonide/formoterol as needed.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears mildly distressed but is in stable condition. Vital signs are within normal limits. Auscultation reveals bilateral basal crackles and decreased breath sounds. There is no wheezing on inspiration. Cardiovascular examination shows regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Lungs are clear to percussion, and abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended without organomegaly. Extremities show mild peripheral edema up to the knees bilaterally. Neurological examination is unremarkable.

Assessment / Diagnosis: The patient's presentation is consistent with an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). His increased dyspnea, productive cough, and basal crackles support this diagnosis. Given his age, history of COPD, and current symptoms, it is essential to rule out other differentials such as pneumonia or heart failure.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be initiated on a course of oral prednisolone 40 mg daily for five days, along with a short-course antibiotic (e.g., azithromycin 500 mg on day 1, then 250 mg on days 2-5) to address potential bacterial exacerbation. Inhaled budesonide/formoterol will be increased to twice daily as needed for dyspnea relief. He will also receive a diuretic (e.g., furosemide 20 mg daily) to manage possible fluid overload contributing to his dyspnea. Ongoing home oxygen therapy will continue, and he will be scheduled for a follow-up chest X-ray in one week to assess resolution of any potential infiltrate.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient is advised to return for a follow-up appointment in one week for reassessment of symptoms and review of the chest X-ray results. He should contact the clinic immediately if his dyspnea worsens, he develops fever or chills, or experiences any new or concerning symptoms. He will also receive instructions on proper inhaler technique and monitoring peak expiratory flow rates at home to track his respiratory status.
