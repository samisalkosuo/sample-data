Clinic or Hospital Location: Kustavi  

Patient Gender: Male  
Patient Age: 19  

Severity Level: 2 (Emergent – potential life threat)

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with acute onset of severe abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.

History of Present Illness (HPI):  
The patient, a 19-year-old male, reports the sudden onset of severe epigastric pain approximately four hours ago. The pain is described as constant, sharp, and rated at 8/10 in intensity. It radiates to his back and is associated with nausea and bilious vomiting. He denies any fever, chills, or diarrhea. There are no urinary symptoms, and he has not noticed any recent trauma or injury to the abdomen.

Physical Examination Findings:  
Vital signs: Blood pressure 130/80 mmHg, heart rate 95 bpm, respiratory rate 18 breaths/min, temperature 37°C, and oxygen saturation 98% on room air. The patient appears distressed due to pain but is cooperative. Abdominal examination reveals guarding, rebound tenderness, and mild rigidity in the epigastric region. Bowel sounds are hyperactive, and there is no rebound or flank tenderness. No other significant findings on general inspection.

Assessment / Diagnosis:  
Given the patient's age, acute presentation with severe epigastric pain, guarding, rebound tenderness, and hyperactive bowel sounds, a differential diagnosis of acute appendicitis or possibly a more serious condition like a perforated viscus is considered. Further investigations are warranted to confirm the diagnosis.

Plan / Treatment:  
1. Admit the patient for further evaluation and management.
2. Order an abdominal CT scan with contrast to assess for appendicitis or other intra-abdominal pathology.
3. Administer intravenous fluids and pain management with IV diclofenac 75mg as needed.
4. Prepare for possible surgical intervention if the imaging confirms acute appendicitis or a perforated viscus.

Follow-up Instructions:  
The patient will be closely monitored in the hospital, and the results of the abdominal CT scan will guide further management. A follow-up appointment will be scheduled post-discharge for suture removal if surgery is performed or for ongoing symptom assessment if conservative management is pursued. The patient should return immediately to the emergency department if symptoms worsen, especially if there's fever, increased abdominal pain, or signs of peritonitis.
