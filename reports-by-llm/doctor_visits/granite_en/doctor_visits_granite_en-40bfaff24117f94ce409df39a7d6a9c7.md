Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient, a 17-year-old male, presents to the emergency department with acute onset of severe chest pain and shortness of breath.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient reports experiencing sudden, crushing substernal chest pain radiating to his left arm, accompanied by diaphoresis and nausea. The symptoms began approximately 30 minutes ago while playing basketball. He denies any history of similar episodes or significant past medical conditions.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears anxious and in distress. His vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 120/80 mmHg, heart rate 130 beats per minute, respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation 92% on room air, and temperature 98.6Â°F. Cardiovascular examination reveals regular rhythm but tachycardia, with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops audible. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended. Extremities show no edema or cyanosis. Neurological examination is unremarkable.

Assessment / Diagnosis: The patient's presentation is highly suggestive of an acute coronary syndrome, likely an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Given the severity and nature of symptoms, immediate cardiac catheterization is warranted to confirm diagnosis and guide potential intervention.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be immediately transferred to a nearby cardiac catheterization laboratory for emergent diagnostic procedures. Pre-procedure medications include aspirin 325 mg and a loading dose of unfractionated heparin. Ongoing monitoring and supportive care will be provided during transport.

Follow-up Instructions: Following the intervention, the patient will require close cardiac monitoring in an intensive care setting. Further management and follow-up will be determined based on the results of the cardiac catheterization and consultation with a cardiology team. The patient's family will be updated regarding his condition and prognosis.
