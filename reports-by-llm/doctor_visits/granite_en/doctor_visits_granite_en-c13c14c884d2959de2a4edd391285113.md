Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with a two-day history of progressive abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. She reports feeling unwell since yesterday evening, with the symptoms worsening overnight.

History of Present Illness (HPI):  
The patient is a 22-year-old female who reports experiencing intermittent, sharp, and cramping abdominal pain in the lower quadrants, rated as an 8 out of 10 in severity. The pain is exacerbated by movement and pressure on the abdomen. She has experienced three episodes of non-bloody, non-mucous emesis per day. There is no fever, chills, or diarrhea. She denies any recent trauma, changes in bowel habits, or urinary symptoms. Her menstrual history is unremarkable, and she is not sexually active.

Physical Examination Findings:  
Vital signs are within normal limits. Abdominal examination reveals guarding, rebound tenderness, and mild distension in the lower abdomen. Bowel sounds are hyperactive, and there is no rebound or flank pain. No costovertebral angle tenderness is noted. Rectal examination is unremarkable with normal anal tone.

Assessment / Diagnosis:  
Given the patient's presentation of severe abdominal pain, guarding, rebound tenderness, and hyperactive bowel sounds, a working diagnosis of acute appendicitis is considered. This assessment aligns with her severity level 2, as it represents an emergent condition that may lead to potential complications if left untreated. Further diagnostic workup, including laboratory tests (complete blood count, urinalysis) and imaging (abdominal ultrasound or CT scan), is recommended for confirmation.

Plan / Treatment:  
1. Admit the patient for further evaluation and management of suspected acute appendicitis.
2. Administer intravenous fluids to maintain hydration.
3. Prescribe pain management with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g., ibuprofen) as appropriate.
4. Obtain laboratory tests: complete blood count, urinalysis, and inflammatory markers (CRP).
5. Arrange abdominal ultrasound or CT scan for definitive diagnosis.
6. Consult with a surgeon for potential appendectomy if the diagnosis is confirmed.

Follow-up Instructions:  
The patient will be followed up by the surgical team for further evaluation and management of her condition. She should return to the clinic within 48 hours post-discharge for review of diagnostic test results and a discussion regarding potential surgical intervention. In the meantime, she is advised to maintain hydration and avoid solid food intake until further instruction from her healthcare provider.
