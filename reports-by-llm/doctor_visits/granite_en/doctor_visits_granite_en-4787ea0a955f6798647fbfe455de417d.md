Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient, a 15-year-old male, presents with acute onset of severe chest pain and shortness of breath.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient reports experiencing sudden, sharp chest pain that started approximately 30 minutes ago while playing soccer. The pain is described as 10/10 in severity, radiating to the left arm, and associated with diaphoresis and nausea. There is no history of similar episodes or significant past medical conditions.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears distressed, diaphoretic, and in moderate respiratory distress. Vital signs reveal a heart rate of 140 bpm, blood pressure of 90/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 88% on room air. Auscultation of lung sounds reveals bilateral wheezing. Cardiovascular examination shows tachycardia with no murmurs or gallops. There is no peripheral edema.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's age, acute onset of severe chest pain, radiation to the left arm, diaphoresis, and shortness of breath, along with abnormal vital signs and lung auscultation findings, the differential diagnosis includes acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or pulmonary embolism. The severity level 1 indicates a potential life-threatening condition requiring immediate intervention.

Plan / Treatment: Immediate ECG is performed, followed by laboratory tests including cardiac enzymes and D-dimer. The patient is started on supplemental oxygen via non-rebreather mask and given aspirin 300 mg orally. Intravenous access is established for potential fluid resuscitation and medication administration. The patient is closely monitored, and a cardiology consult is requested for further management.

Follow-up Instructions: Given the acute nature of the presentation, the patient will be admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) for continuous monitoring and further diagnostic workup. The patient's guardian will be updated on the situation, and a follow-up appointment will be scheduled once the patient's condition is more stable.
