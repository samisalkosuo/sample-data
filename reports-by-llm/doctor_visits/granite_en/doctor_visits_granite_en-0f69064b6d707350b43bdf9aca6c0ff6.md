Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient, an 8-year-old male, presents with a 3-day history of progressive difficulty breathing and increasing wheezing. The parent reports that the child has had several similar episodes in the past few months, each following respiratory infections.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient's symptoms began 3 days ago with a dry cough, followed by progressive shortness of breath and audible wheezing. The parent reports that the child has had several similar episodes in the past few months, each following respiratory infections. The symptoms are exacerbated at night and with minimal exertion. The patient denies any fever, chest pain, or recent trauma.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient is alert and oriented but appears mildly distressed due to breathing difficulties. Vital signs are as follows: temperature 98.6°F, heart rate 120 bpm, respiratory rate 40 breaths/min, blood pressure 105/65 mmHg, and oxygen saturation 92% on room air. Auscultation reveals bilateral wheezing throughout inspiration and expiration, with increased use of accessory muscles. Cardiovascular and abdominal examinations are unremarkable.

Assessment / Diagnosis: The patient's history, physical examination findings, and pattern of symptoms are suggestive of recurrent wheezing exacerbations, consistent with asthma. The current episode is classified as a severity level 4 due to the child's distress and the need for pharmacological intervention.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be started on a short course of oral prednisolone (0.6 mg/kg/day for 5 days) and albuterol inhaler (two puffs every 4-6 hours as needed). The parent will be instructed on proper inhaler technique and the importance of peak flow monitoring. The patient will also receive a prescription for a short-acting beta-agonist inhaler for rescue use.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient should follow up with the pediatrician or a pulmonologist within 1 week to reassess symptoms and adjust treatment as needed. The parent will be provided with an appointment schedule and instructions on when to seek immediate medical attention if symptoms worsen. Additionally, the parent will receive education on asthma management, triggers, and environmental control measures.
