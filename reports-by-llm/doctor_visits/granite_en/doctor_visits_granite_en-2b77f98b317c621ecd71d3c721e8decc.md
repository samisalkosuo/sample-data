Clinic or Hospital Location: Rautavaara  

Patient Gender: Female  
Patient Age: 86  

Severity Level: 3 (Urgent â€“ stable, needs 2+ resources)

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with progressive dyspnea and lower extremity edema of one-week duration.

History of Present Illness (HPI): An 86-year-old female reports a one-week history of worsening shortness of breath, particularly with minimal exertion, and bilateral lower extremity swelling up to her knees. She denies any chest pain, cough, or fever. Her symptoms have been gradually worsening since onset.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears mildly distressed but is in stable condition. Vital signs are as follows: Blood pressure 140/80 mmHg, heart rate 92 bpm, respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 92% on room air. Cardiovascular examination reveals a regular rhythm but a III/VI holosystolic murmur best heard at the apex. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally with no wheezes or rhonchi. Abdominal examination is benign, and there is no hepatosplenomegaly. Lower extremities show 2+ pitting edema up to mid-thighs.

Assessment / Diagnosis: The patient's presentation is suggestive of congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation with acute onset, likely secondary to decompensated left ventricular dysfunction. The new-onset lower extremity edema and worsening dyspnea on minimal exertion support this diagnosis.

Plan / Treatment: 

1. Initiate loop diuretics (Bumetanide 1mg PO q12h) to manage fluid overload.
2. Prescribe angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (Lisinopril 5mg PO daily) for long-term management of heart failure and renal protection.
3. Schedule echocardiogram to assess left ventricular function and evaluate the severity of valvular regurgitation.
4. Refer to cardiology for further evaluation and management.
5. Advise patient to restrict fluid intake and follow up in 1 week or sooner if symptoms worsen.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient is scheduled for a follow-up appointment in one week at Rautavaara Clinic. She should contact the clinic immediately if her condition worsens before this time. Additionally, she must adhere to the prescribed medication regimen and fluid restrictions.
