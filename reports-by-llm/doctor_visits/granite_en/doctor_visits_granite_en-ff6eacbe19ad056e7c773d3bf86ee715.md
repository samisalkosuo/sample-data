Clinic or Hospital Location: Nurmes
Severity Level: 4 (Less-urgent â€“ stable, needs 1 resource)
Patient Gender: Female
Patient Age: 88

Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient, an 88-year-old female, presents with a chief complaint of progressive shortness of breath and mild lower extremity edema over the past two weeks. She reports feeling more fatigued than usual and has noticed her ankles swelling upon standing.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient denies any chest pain, cough, or fever. She has a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease stage III, all of which are well-controlled with medications. She reports no recent weight changes but acknowledges decreased mobility due to arthritis in her lower extremities.

Physical Examination Findings: On examination, the patient appears anxious but is in stable condition. Her vital signs are within normal limits. Cardiovascular assessment reveals regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. There is mild pitting edema noted in the lower extremities up to the knees. Abdominal examination is unremarkable, and there is no peripheral adventitious blowing sounds. Neurological examination is grossly intact.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's history and current presentation, a likely diagnosis of congestive heart failure exacerbation due to possible decompensation secondary to decreased mobility and potential medication non-compliance is considered. Further investigations such as an echocardiogram and BNP level may be warranted for confirmation.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be started on oral furosemide 20mg daily, with instructions to monitor urine output and follow up if there are no improvements in symptoms within three days. She will also be referred to physical therapy for home-based exercises to improve mobility and reduce lower extremity edema. The patient's current medications will be reviewed by her primary care physician to ensure optimal management of her chronic conditions.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient is scheduled for a follow-up appointment in one week at the Nurmes clinic. She should contact the office immediately if she experiences worsening shortness of breath, increased lower extremity swelling, or any other concerning symptoms before her scheduled appointment.
