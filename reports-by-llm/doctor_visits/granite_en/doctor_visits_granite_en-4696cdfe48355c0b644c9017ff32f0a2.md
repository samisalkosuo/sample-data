Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient, a 92-year-old male, presents with acute onset confusion and disorientation, reported by his caregiver. He has also experienced a sudden decline in oral intake and increased lethargy over the past 48 hours.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient's caregiver reports that he has been progressively more confused since yesterday, with difficulty following simple commands and orienting to person, place, and time. He has also shown a significant decrease in his usual daily intake, consuming only small amounts of liquids. The patient's lethargy has increased, with minimal verbalization and reduced movement. There is no history of recent falls, head trauma, or fever.

Physical Examination Findings: On examination, the patient appears alert but confused, with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 12 (Eyes - E4V3, Verbal - 3Confused, Motor - 6Withdraws to pain). Vital signs are within normal limits, except for a mild tachycardia at 98 bpm. His pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. Neurological examination reveals no focal deficits. A bedside glucose check was performed, revealing a blood glucose level of 105 mg/dL.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's age, acute onset confusion, altered mental status, and decreased oral intake, a differential diagnosis is considered, including delirium, urinary tract infection (UTI), pneumonia, or medication side effects. Further investigations are warranted to rule out these possibilities.

Plan / Treatment:
1. Order a comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), complete blood count (CBC), and urinalysis to evaluate electrolyte levels, renal function, and rule out infection.
2. Initiate intravenous hydration with normal saline to address potential dehydration.
3. Administer a trial of low-dose haloperidol for possible delirium management, considering the patient's age and confusion.
4. Obtain a urine specimen for culture and sensitivity testing to rule out UTI.
5. Consult with the geriatric or internal medicine team for further evaluation and management.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the facility for at least 24 hours, with daily neurological assessments. A follow-up appointment will be scheduled once the investigations are complete to review results and adjust the treatment plan accordingly. The caregiver should be advised to maintain a detailed symptom diary and report any changes or worsening in the patient's condition promptly.
