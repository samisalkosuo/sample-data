Visit Date: 03.12.2023  
Clinic or Hospital Location: Pielavesi  

Patient Gender: Female  
Patient Age: 31  

Severity Level: 4 (Less-urgent â€“ stable, stable, 1 resource)

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with a persistent cough and progressive shortness of breath for the past two weeks. She also reports intermittent chest pain and occasional wheezing.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 31-year-old female, reports the onset of her symptoms approximately two weeks ago. Initially, she experienced a dry cough that has since become productive with yellowish sputum. Over the past few days, she has noticed increasing shortness of breath, particularly during exertion, and occasional sharp chest pain that worsens with deep inspiration. She denies any recent travel, sick contacts, or known allergies. Her only medication is an oral contraceptive for birth control.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears mildly distressed but is in stable condition. Vital signs are within normal limits. Auscultation of the lungs reveals decreased breath sounds and wheezing throughout both lung fields. Percussion elicits dullness over the right lower lung lobe, suggestive of possible consolidation. There is no evidence of retractions or use of accessory muscles. Cardiovascular examination reveals normal heart rate and rhythm with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and normoactive bowel sounds. Extremities show no edema, and peripheral pulses are strong and equal bilaterally. Neurological examination is unremarkable.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Based on the patient's history and physical examination findings, she likely has a lower respiratory tract infection with possible right lower lobe pneumonia. The symptoms of cough, purulent sputum, shortness of breath, and chest pain are concerning for an infectious process. Further diagnostic testing, including a chest X-ray and possibly a sputum culture, is recommended to confirm the diagnosis.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be prescribed a course of oral antibiotics (e.g., Amoxicillin-Clavulanate 625mg BID for 7 days) targeting common respiratory pathogens. She will also receive an inhaler with a short-acting bronchodilator (e.g., Albuterol inhaler as needed for dyspnea) to alleviate her symptoms and improve airway function. She is advised to increase fluid intake, rest, and avoid smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke. If symptoms worsen or do not improve within the next 48-72 hours, she should return for further evaluation.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient is scheduled for a follow-up appointment in one week to reassess her condition and ensure appropriate response to treatment. She should contact the clinic immediately if she experiences worsening symptoms such as increased dyspnea, hemoptysis, or fever.
