Chief Complaint: The patient presents with acute-onset chest pain, shortness of breath, and diaphoresis.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient reports experiencing sudden, severe chest pain radiating to the left arm, accompanied by shortness of breath and profuse sweating, which began approximately 30 minutes ago while at rest. He denies any preceding exertion or known history of coronary artery disease.

Physical Examination Findings: The patient appears anxious and in distress. His vital signs reveal a blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg, heart rate of 130 bpm, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 92% on room air, and temperature of 37Â°C.

Extremities show no edema, and peripheral pulses are intact. Neurological examination is unremarkable.

Assessment / Diagnosis: The patient's presentation is highly suggestive of an acute coronary syndrome (ACS), likely a ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Urgent cardiac catheterization and potential percutaneous coronary intervention are indicated.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be immediately transferred to the nearest cardiac catheterization laboratory for emergent diagnostic angiography and possible percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Intravenous access is established, and aspirin 325 mg, nitroglycerin 0.4 mL sublingually, and heparin 10,000 units intravenously are administered. Continuous ECG monitoring is initiated.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored during transportation to the cardiac catheterization laboratory. Upon arrival, the interventional cardiologist will provide further updates on the procedure and post-procedure care. The patient should follow up with a cardiology specialist within one week for ongoing management and rehabilitation planning.
