Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient, a 93-year-old female, presents with sudden onset of severe chest pain and shortness of breath.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient reports experiencing a sharp, crushing chest pain radiating to her left arm, which began approximately 30 minutes prior to arrival. She also describes difficulty breathing and feeling faint. She has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia but is currently non-compliant with medications. She denies any recent trauma or exertion preceding the onset of symptoms.

Physical Examination Findings: The patient appears distressed, diaphoretic, and in moderate respiratory distress. Blood pressure is 80/50 mmHg, heart rate is 120 beats per minute and irregular, oxygen saturation is 88% on room air, and temperature is normal at 98.6Â°F. Auscultation reveals decreased breath sounds on the left side and a friction rub heard best at the base of the left lung. ECG shows ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, and aVF, suggestive of an acute inferior myocardial infarction.

Assessment / Diagnosis: The patient is experiencing an acute inferior myocardial infarction, likely secondary to coronary artery occlusion. This is a cardiac emergency requiring immediate intervention.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be immediately transferred to the nearest cardiac catheterization lab for emergent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with potential stenting. She will receive aspirin 325 mg, nitroglycerin 0.4 mg sublingually every 5 minutes, and a loading dose of clopidogrel 300 mg. Heparin will be administered for systemic anticoagulation during the procedure.

Follow-up Instructions: Following successful PCI, the patient will be transferred to the cardiac care unit (CCU) for close monitoring. She will require ongoing treatment with dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin and clopidogrel), statin therapy, and potentially additional medications based on her post-procedure course. A follow-up appointment with a cardiologist will be scheduled prior to discharge from the hospital. The patient's primary care provider will also be notified of this admission and treatment plan.
