Severity Level: 3 (Urgent â€“ stable, needs 2+ resources)
Patient Gender: Female
Patient Age: 13

Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient, a 13-year-old female, presents with acute abdominal pain and vomiting of two days duration.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient reports experiencing severe epigastric pain, rated as 8/10 in intensity, accompanied by non-bilious, non-blood tainted vomiting. The pain began two days ago and has been constant since then. She describes the pain as cramping and sharp, exacerbated by movement or deep breaths. There is no fever, diarrhea, or urinary symptoms. She denies any recent trauma, abdominal surgeries, or significant weight loss.

Physical Examination Findings: The patient appears well-developed for her age and in moderate distress due to pain. Vital signs are within normal limits except for mild tachycardia (105 bpm). Abdominal examination reveals guarding, rebound tenderness, and mild diffuse tenderness, particularly in the epigastric region. Bowel sounds are hyperactive but present. No masses or organomegaly are appreciated.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's age, acute onset of severe epigastric pain with guarding and rebound tenderness, a differential diagnosis including appendicitis, ovarian torsion, or renal colic is considered. Further investigations are warranted to confirm the diagnosis.

Plan / Treatment:
1. Admission for further evaluation and management due to urgency (Severity Level 3).
2. Order abdominal ultrasound and possibly CT scan with contrast to assess for appendicitis, ovarian pathology, or renal causes of pain.
3. Administer intravenous fluids for hydration and pain control with IV diclofenac as per local guidelines.
4. Consult pediatric surgery for possible early intervention if imaging suggests appendicitis or other surgical pathology.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be monitored in the hospital for further evaluation and management. Depending on the imaging results, she may require surgical consultation and intervention. A follow-up appointment will be scheduled post-discharge for review of findings and any necessary ongoing care. Parents are advised to contact the clinic immediately if symptoms worsen or new symptoms develop before the follow-up visit.
