31.08.2024, Kustavi Clinic Visit Report:

Chief Complaint: The patient, a 45-year-old male, presents with progressive shortness of breath and chest discomfort of one week's duration.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient reports experiencing intermittent chest tightness and shortness of breath for the past week, which has gradually worsened over the past three days. He describes the discomfort as a pressing sensation in the center of his chest, exacerbated by exertion, and associated with occasional palpitations. He denies any history of similar symptoms or significant past medical conditions.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears mildly distressed but is oriented and in no acute distress. Vital signs are as follows: Blood pressure 140/90 mmHg, heart rate 95 bpm, respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation 92% on room air, and temperature 37Â°C. Cardiovascular examination reveals regular rhythm but a III/VI holosystolic murmur heard best at the apex. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and normoactive bowels. Extremities show no edema.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's age, recent onset of progressive chest discomfort, and physical examination findings, a provisional diagnosis of acute decompensated heart failure with possible underlying left ventricular dysfunction is made. Further investigations are recommended to confirm this suspicion.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be commenced on intravenous furosemide 40mg, with close monitoring for response. He will also receive oral lisinopril 5mg daily upon discharge for long-term management of hypertension and potential heart failure. An echocardiogram is recommended to assess cardiac function. The patient should follow up in the cardiology clinic within one week for further evaluation and management.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be contacted by the clinic within 48 hours to discuss the results of his echocardiogram and to arrange a follow-up appointment with the cardiologist. He should avoid strenuous activities and contact the clinic immediately if symptoms worsen or new symptoms develop.
