Clinic or Hospital Location: Juupajoki  

Severity Level: 3 (Urgent – stable, needs 2+ resources)  

Patient Gender: Female  
Patient Age: 45  

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with a chief complaint of progressive shortness of breath and chest discomfort for the past three days. She reports feeling increasingly fatigued and experiencing occasional palpitations.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 45-year-old female, reports that her symptoms began approximately three days ago with mild shortness of breath during daily activities. Over the past two days, she has experienced worsening dyspnea at rest and intermittent chest discomfort described as pressure or tightness. She also mentions occasional episodes of palpitations without any associated dizziness or syncope. There is no history of fever, cough, hemoptysis, or recent travel.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears mildly distressed but is in stable condition. Vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 130/85 mmHg, heart rate 95 bpm, respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation 92% on room air, and temperature 98.6°F. Cardiovascular examination reveals regular rhythm but a faint third heart sound and mild lower extremity edema. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally with expiratory wheezing heard in the lower lung fields. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and normoactive bowels. Extremities show mild pitting edema up to the knees.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's history, physical examination findings, and vital signs, she is suspected of having acute exacerbation of her underlying chronic heart failure (likely related to her history of hypertension), possibly precipitated by an unrecognized pulmonary condition such as a viral or atypical pneumonia. Further diagnostic testing including chest X-ray, electrocardiogram (ECG), and blood work (BNP, CBC, comprehensive metabolic panel, and D-dimer) is recommended to confirm the diagnosis and assess severity.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be started on intravenous furosemide 40mg for acute management of fluid overload, oral loop diuretics (bumetanide 2mg daily) for long-term management, and lisinopril 10mg daily to control blood pressure. She will also receive supplemental oxygen as needed to maintain oxygen saturation above 90%. Given the suspicion of a possible pulmonary process, she will be prescribed a five-day course of azithromycin 500mg on day one followed by 250mg for the next four days. She will be referred to a cardiologist and pulmonologist for further evaluation and management.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient should return for follow-up in one week or sooner if symptoms worsen. She must adhere to her medication regimen, monitor her weight daily, and report any worsening dyspnea, increased fatigue, or other concerning symptoms immediately. She will also need to schedule appointments with the referred specialists for ongoing care.
