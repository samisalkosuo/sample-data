Clinic or Hospital Location: Kokkola  

Patient Gender: Female  
Patient Age: 60  

Severity Level: 3 (Urgent â€“ stable, needs 2+ resources)

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with a persistent cough and progressive shortness of breath for the past two weeks. She also reports intermittent chest pain and occasional wheezing.

History of Present Illness (HPI): A 60-year-old female patient reports the onset of her symptoms approximately two weeks ago. Initially, she experienced a dry cough and mild fatigue, which have since progressed to include significant shortness of breath, especially during exertion. She describes the chest pain as sharp, intermittent, and worsening with deep inspiration or coughing. The patient denies any recent travel, sick contacts, or known allergies. Her past medical history is significant for well-controlled hypertension and mild asthma. She is a non-smoker and reports no alcohol consumption.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears mildly distressed but is in stable condition. Vital signs are within normal limits except for oxygen saturation, which is 92% on room air. Auscultation of the lungs reveals bilateral wheezing and decreased breath sounds at the bases. Percussion note is dull, and vocal resonance is hyper-resonant, suggesting possible consolidation. There is no wheezing heard in the neck or abdomen. Cardiovascular examination reveals regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Abdominal examination is unremarkable, with no tenderness or organomegaly. Neurological examination is non-contributory.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Based on the patient's history, physical examination findings, and consideration of her medical background, a working diagnosis of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with possible pneumonia is made. Further investigations, including chest X-ray and spirometry, are recommended to confirm the diagnosis and assess the severity.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be initiated on a short course of high-dose oral corticosteroids (prednisolone 40mg daily) and antibiotics (azithromycin 500mg once daily) to address the suspected exacerbation. She will also receive a bronchodilator inhaler (salbutamol/albuterol) for immediate relief of symptoms. The patient is advised to use her inhaler as prescribed and to follow up if symptoms worsen or do not improve within 72 hours. She will be referred for a chest X-ray and spirometry testing at the local diagnostic center.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient should return for a follow-up appointment in one week or sooner if her symptoms worsen. She will also need to schedule an urgent referral for a pulmonary function test and chest X-ray at the nearest diagnostic facility. In the meantime, she must continue monitoring her oxygen saturation levels at home using a pulse oximeter and report any further decline in saturation or worsening symptoms immediately.
