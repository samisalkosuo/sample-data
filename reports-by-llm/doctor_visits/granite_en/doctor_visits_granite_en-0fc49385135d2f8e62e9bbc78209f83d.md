Visit Date: 18.06.2024  
Clinic or Hospital Location: Pelkosenniemi  

Patient Gender: Male  
Patient Age: 26  

Severity Level: 4 (Less-urgent â€“ stable, 1 resource)

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with a persistent cough and progressive shortness of breath for the past two weeks. He also reports intermittent chest pain and occasional wheezing.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 26-year-old male, reports the onset of a persistent cough approximately two weeks ago. Initially, it was dry but has since become productive with yellowish sputum. He describes his shortness of breath as progressively worsening, particularly during exertion, and reports occasional chest tightness and intermittent sharp chest pain that worsens with deep inspiration. The patient also mentions experiencing episodes of wheezing, more noticeable at night. He denies any recent travel, sick contacts, or known allergies.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears mildly distressed but is in stable condition. Vital signs are within normal limits. Auscultation of the lungs reveals decreased breath sounds bilaterally with occasional wheezing heard throughout. Percussion elicits dullness over the right lower lung fields, and perihilar crackles are appreciated. There is no evidence of retractions or use of accessory muscles. Cardiovascular examination is unremarkable, with regular rate and rhythm, and no murmurs, rubs, or gallops noted. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and normoactive bowel sounds are heard. Extremities show no edema, and peripheral pulses are strong and equal bilaterally. Neurological examination is unremarkable.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Based on the patient's history and physical examination findings, a working diagnosis of pneumonia with possible underlying asthma exacerbation is made. Further diagnostic testing, including chest X-ray and possibly spirometry, may be warranted to confirm this assessment and evaluate the extent of lung involvement.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be prescribed a course of oral antibiotics (e.g., Amoxicillin 500mg tid for 7 days) targeting common respiratory pathogens, along with an inhaled short-acting beta-agonist (e.g., Albuterol inhaler prn as needed for symptom relief). He will also be advised to use a nebulizer with budesonide/formoterol as a maintenance therapy to control asthma symptoms if the diagnosis is confirmed. The patient should rest and avoid strenuous activity until symptoms improve. He will be scheduled for follow-up in one week for reassessment and potential adjustment of treatment based on symptom response.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient is advised to return for a follow-up appointment in one week or sooner if symptoms worsen, particularly if he develops fever, increased shortness of breath, or chest pain. He should also contact the clinic immediately if he experiences any difficulty breathing or bluish discoloration of lips or nail beds. In the interim, he is instructed to monitor his symptoms and use the prescribed inhaler as directed for managing asthma symptoms.
