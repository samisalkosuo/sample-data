Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient is a 7-year-old male presenting with acute onset of difficulty breathing and wheezing.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient's mother reports that her son started experiencing shortness of breath and wheezing approximately 2 hours ago. Initially, the symptoms were mild, but they have progressively worsened, leading to audible wheezing and increased respiratory distress. There is no known history of asthma or allergies in the patient.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears anxious and in moderate respiratory distress. Vital signs are as follows: temperature 98.6°F (37°C), heart rate 140 bpm, respiratory rate 50 breaths per minute, blood pressure 90/50 mmHg, and oxygen saturation 88% on room air. Auscultation reveals bilateral wheezing throughout lung fields. Cardiovascular and abdominal examinations are unremarkable.

Assessment / Diagnosis: The patient's presentation is consistent with an acute asthma exacerbation, likely triggered by an unknown factor. The severity of symptoms warrants immediate intervention to improve airway patency and respiratory status.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will receive a nebulized treatment with albuterol (2.5 mg) via a suitable mask. Intravenous access will be established for fluid resuscitation and potential administration of corticosteroids if the response to bronchodilator therapy is inadequate. Continuous cardiorespiratory monitoring will be maintained during treatment.

Follow-up Instructions: Following initial stabilization, the patient will be referred to a pediatric pulmonologist for further evaluation and management of his asthma. The mother should follow up with the primary care provider within one week to reassess symptoms and adjust the asthma action plan as needed. Additionally, she should ensure access to a quick-relief inhaler (e.g., albuterol) for future episodes of bronchospasm.
