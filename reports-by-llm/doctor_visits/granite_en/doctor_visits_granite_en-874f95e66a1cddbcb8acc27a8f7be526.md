Clinic or Hospital Location: Paltamo
Severity Level: 5 (Non-urgent – minor complaints)
Patient Gender: Male
Patient Age: 44

Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with a persistent cough and mild shortness of breath for the past two weeks. He also reports occasional wheezing, especially at night.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient is a 44-year-old male who has been experiencing a gradual onset of a dry cough, mild dyspnea, and intermittent wheezing for approximately two weeks. He denies any recent travel, sick contacts, or known allergies. He works as an office worker and reports no recent changes in his environment or occupational exposure. The symptoms have been progressively worsening, particularly at night, causing him some discomfort but not interfering significantly with his daily activities.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears well-groomed and in no acute distress. Vital signs are within normal limits: blood pressure 124/78 mmHg, heart rate 76 bpm, respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, temperature 98.6°F (37°C), and oxygen saturation 98% on room air. Lung auscultation reveals mild bilateral wheezing more prominent in the lower lobes. Cardiovascular and abdominal examinations are unremarkable, with no peripheral edema or tenderness noted.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Based on the patient's history and physical examination findings, a likely diagnosis of mild asthma exacerbation is considered. The patient's symptoms have been consistent with this condition, and his response to short-acting bronchodilators during the office visit supports this assessment.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be started on a short course of a low-dose inhaled corticosteroid (e.g., fluticasone 100 mcg bid) and a long-acting bronchodilator (e.g., salmeterol 50 mcg bid). He will also be provided with a rescue inhaler containing albuterol for symptom relief as needed. The patient will be advised to avoid known triggers, such as dust and pet dander, and to use a spacer device with his inhalers for optimal medication delivery.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient is scheduled for a follow-up appointment in four weeks to reassess his symptoms and adjust treatment if necessary. He should return sooner if his symptoms worsen or if he experiences increased shortness of breath, nighttime coughing, or chest tightness. Additionally, the patient will be referred to a local pulmonologist for further evaluation and management of his asthma.
