Clinic or Hospital Location: Kokemäki  

Patient Gender: Male  
Patient Age: 94  

Severity Level: 3 (Urgent – stable, needs 2+ resources)

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with a three-day history of progressive dyspnea and mild chest pain. He reports feeling more short of breath with minimal exertion and describes the discomfort as a dull, aching sensation in his left chest.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The 94-year-old male patient reports no recent injuries or trauma but mentions experiencing intermittent mild shortness of breath for the past week, which has worsened over the last three days. He describes the current episode as more severe than previous occasions, with noticeable difficulty in performing daily activities such as dressing and bathing. He denies any fever, cough, or hemoptysis. His past medical history is significant for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hypertension, and atrial fibrillation. He takes warfarin, lisinopril, and salmeterol as prescribed.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears mildly distressed but is in stable condition. Vital signs are within normal limits for age except for a respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute. Oxygen saturation on room air is 88%, improving to 94% with supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula at 2L/min. Auscultation reveals bilateral basal crackles and decreased breath sounds in the left lower lobe. Cardiovascular examination shows regular rhythm with a rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure 130/80 mmHg, and no murmurs appreciated. There is no peripheral edema noted.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's age, history of COPD exacerbation, current symptoms, and physical examination findings, a likely diagnosis of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) with possible left lower lobe pneumonia is made.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be initiated on intravenous corticosteroids (methylprednisolone 40mg), antibiotics (ceftriaxone 500mg once daily), and bronchodilators (salbutamol nebulizer as needed). He will continue his prescribed medications (warfarin, lisinopril, and salmeterol) as tolerated. Continuous oxygen therapy via nasal cannula at 2L/min will be maintained. A chest X-ray has been ordered to confirm the suspected pneumonia.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient should return for a follow-up appointment in one week or sooner if symptoms worsen. He will also require ongoing monitoring of his respiratory status and oxygen requirements during this period. Further investigations, such as sputum cultures and spirometry, may be considered based on the chest X-ray results and clinical response.
