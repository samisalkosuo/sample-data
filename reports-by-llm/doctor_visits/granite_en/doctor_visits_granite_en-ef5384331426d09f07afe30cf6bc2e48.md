Patient: Female, 103 years old
Severity Level: 3 (Urgent)

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with progressive dyspnea and a three-day history of increased confusion.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient reports a gradual worsening of shortness of breath over the past week, now requiring assistance for ambulation. She denies any chest pain but mentions occasional palpitations. Over the last three days, she has become increasingly disoriented and confused, with her family noting decreased responsiveness to verbal cues and environmental changes.

Physical Examination Findings: Vital signs reveal a blood pressure of 120/70 mmHg, heart rate of 95 bpm, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 88% on room air. The patient appears mildly distressed but is not in acute respiratory distress. Auscultation of the lungs reveals bilateral basal crackles. Cardiovascular examination shows a regular rhythm with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Neurological assessment demonstrates confusion, disorientation to time and place, and a Glascow Coma Scale score of 12 (Eyes: 4, Verbal: 3, Motor: 5).

Assessment / Diagnosis: The patient's presentation is consistent with acute exacerbation of chronic heart failure (CHF) and possible delirium secondary to inadequate oxygenation. Further evaluation with electrocardiogram (ECG), chest X-ray, and blood tests is recommended to assess cardiac function and rule out other causes of confusion.

Plan / Treatment: Initiate treatment for acute CHF exacerbation with intravenous furosemide 20mg, bumetanide 1mg, and morphine 2mg for dyspnea relief. Administer supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula to maintain oxygen saturation above 90%. Obtain blood tests (BNP, electrolytes, renal function) and ECG. Consult with a geriatrician or cardiologist for further management.

Follow-up Instructions: Schedule an outpatient follow-up within one week for reassessment of symptoms and review of diagnostic test results. Encourage the patient's family to monitor her condition closely and report any worsening symptoms immediately.
