Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with a two-day history of progressive chest pain, shortness of breath, and intermittent diaphoresis.

History of Present Illness (HPI): A 52-year-old male reports the onset of chest discomfort approximately 48 hours ago. The pain is described as a pressing sensation in the center of his chest, exacerbated by exertion and relieved by rest. He also reports shortness of breath at rest and during minimal activity, along with episodes of diaphoresis. There are no associated gastrointestinal symptoms, and he denies any recent trauma or illness.

Physical Examination Findings: The patient appears mildly distressed but is in stable condition. Vital signs are within normal limits except for a heart rate of 98 bpm and respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute. Cardiovascular exam reveals regular rhythm with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and normoactive bowel sounds. Extremities show no edema, and peripheral pulses are strong and equal. Neurological exam is unremarkable.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's age, presenting symptoms, and stable vital signs, a working diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is considered. Further evaluation with an electrocardiogram (ECG) and cardiac biomarkers is warranted to rule out myocardial infarction or unstable angina.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will undergo immediate ECG and cardiac biomarker testing. If results are positive for ACS, he will be managed according to the appropriate acute coronary syndrome protocol, which may include antiplatelet therapy, anticoagulation, pain management, and potential revascularization.

Follow-up Instructions: Depending on the ECG and biomarker results, the patient may require further evaluation by a cardiologist for possible inpatient management or outpatient follow-up. He should return to the clinic within 48 hours for a review of test results and discussion of management plan. In the interim, he is advised to avoid strenuous activity and report any worsening symptoms immediately.
