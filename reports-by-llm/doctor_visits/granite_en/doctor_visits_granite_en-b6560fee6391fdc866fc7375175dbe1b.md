Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with a 3-day history of progressive lower abdominal pain, fever, and dysuria.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 24-year-old female, reports the onset of severe lower abdominal pain approximately 72 hours ago. The pain is described as constant, sharp, and worsening in intensity. It radiates to the back and is associated with fever (up to 39°C) and a burning sensation during urination (dysuria). She denies any vaginal discharge, vomiting, or diarrhea. Her menstrual history is unremarkable, and she is not sexually active at present.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears moderately distressed due to pain. Vital signs are within normal limits except for a temperature of 38.2°C. Abdominal examination reveals tenderness in the lower quadrants, particularly in McBurney's point, with rebound tenderness and guarding. Digital rectal examination is unremarkable. Urinalysis shows pyuria with a few red blood cells.

Assessment / Diagnosis: The patient's presentation is suggestive of acute appendicitis. The severity of symptoms, right-sided lower abdominal pain, fever, and positive McMurray's sign support this diagnosis.

Plan / Treatment: Given the clinical suspicion of acute appendicitis, the patient is recommended for urgent surgical consultation. In the interim, she will be started on intravenous fluids to maintain hydration and given 1 gram of intravenous ceftriaxone for suspected bacterial infection. She will be admitted for further management.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be followed up post-operatively as per the surgical team's recommendations. She should contact the clinic immediately if she experiences worsening pain, fever, or any other concerning symptoms before her follow-up appointment.
