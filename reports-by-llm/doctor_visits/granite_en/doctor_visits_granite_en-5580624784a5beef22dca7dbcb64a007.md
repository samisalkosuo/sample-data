Clinic or Hospital Location: Miehikkälä  

Patient Gender: Male  
Patient Age: 21  

Severity Level: 2 (Emergent – potential life threat)

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with acute onset of severe abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.

History of Present Illness (HPI):  
The patient, a 21-year-old male, reports the sudden onset of severe epigastric pain approximately three hours ago. The pain is described as constant, sharp, and rated at 9/10 in intensity. It radiates to his back and is associated with nausea and two episodes of non-bilious, non-blood vomiting. He denies any fever, chills, or recent trauma. The patient's symptoms began while playing basketball and have progressively worsened since then.

Physical Examination Findings:  
Vital signs: Blood pressure 130/80 mmHg, heart rate 95 bpm, respiratory rate 18 breaths/min, temperature 37°C (oral), and oxygen saturation 98% on room air. The patient appears distressed due to pain but is cooperative.  
General: No guarding or rebound tenderness noted.  
Abdomen: Mild tenderness in the epigastric region with no rebound or guarding. Auscultation reveals normal bowel sounds. No masses or organomegaly detected.  
Excision: Negative for Costello's sign.

Assessment / Diagnosis:  
Given the acute onset of severe epigastric pain, associated nausea and vomiting without fever or recent trauma, a differential diagnosis is made including acute pancreatitis, gastroduodenal ulcer perforation, or renal colic. Further investigations are warranted to rule out these conditions.

Plan / Treatment:  
1. Admit the patient for further evaluation and management.
2. Order a serum amylase, lipase, complete blood count (CBC), comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), urinalysis, and abdominal CT scan with contrast to assess for pancreatitis or other intra-abdominal pathology.
3. Administer intravenous fluids for hydration and pain management with IV meperidine 50mg as needed.
4. Hold all oral intake temporarily.
5. Consult a surgical specialist if the CT scan reveals signs of perforation or other urgent surgical conditions.

Follow-up Instructions:  
The patient will be monitored closely in the hospital setting for the next 24-48 hours pending further diagnostic results. If the investigations reveal acute pancreatitis, a gastroenterology consult will be arranged for specialized management. The patient should follow up with the clinic within one week post-discharge for review of results and ongoing care plan. In case of worsening symptoms or development of new complaints prior to this appointment, he is advised to seek immediate medical attention.
