Severity Level: 3 (Urgent – stable, needs 2+ resources)  
Patient Gender: Male  
Patient Age: 40

Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with a 3-day history of progressive shortness of breath and chest pain. He reports feeling increasingly fatigued and experiencing mild fever.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 40-year-old male, reports the onset of symptoms three days ago. Initially, he experienced intermittent chest discomfort, which has become constant and now radiates to his left arm. He describes the pain as a pressure-like sensation, rated at 7/10 in severity. Alongside the chest pain, he developed shortness of breath at rest, which has worsened over over the past two days, prompting his current visit. He also mentions having a low-grade fever and feeling generally fatigued. He denies any cough, sputum production, or recent injuries. His past medical history is significant for well-controlled hypertension, and he is a non-smoker.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears mildly distressed but is in stable condition. Vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 140/90 mmHg, heart rate 95 bpm, respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, temperature 38°C, and oxygen saturation 92% on room air. Cardiovascular examination reveals regular rhythm but mild tachycardia. A grade II/VI systolic murmur is heard best at the left sternal border, radiating to the carotids. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended with no organomegaly noted. Extremities show no signs of edema or cyanosis. Neurological examination is unremarkable.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's age, recent onset of chest pain radiating to the left arm, shortness of breath, fever, and elevated blood pressure, a possible diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) with potential myocardial infarction cannot be ruled out. Further investigations are warranted to confirm this suspicion.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will undergo immediate electrocardiogram (ECG), cardiac biomarkers (troponin, CK-MB), and a chest X-ray. He will be started on sublingual nitroglycerin for symptom relief and aspirin 300 mg for potential thrombosis prevention. He will be closely monitored in the observation unit for further management based on investigation results.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient should return to the clinic within 48 hours for a follow-up appointment to review his investigations and discuss any necessary interventions, such as cardiology referral or potential revascularization procedures, depending on the findings. He will also be scheduled for regular follow-ups with a cardiologist for ongoing management of his condition.
