Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with a 3-day history of progressive shortness of breath and chest pain. He reports feeling increasingly fatigued and experiencing mild fever.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 36-year-old male, reports the onset of symptoms three days ago. Initially, he experienced intermittent chest discomfort, which has become constant and now radiates to his left arm. He describes the pain as a pressure-like sensation, rated at 7/10 in severity. Accompanying this, he has developed shortness of breath, particularly with exertion, and reports a mild fever of approximately 38°C. He denies any cough, hemoptysis, or wheezing. He has no significant past medical history but is a smoker with approximately 15 cigarettes per day for the past ten years.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears mildly distressed and diaphoretic. His vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 130/80 mmHg, heart rate 95 bpm, respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation 92% on room air, and temperature 38°C. Cardiovascular examination reveals regular rhythm but with a fourth heart sound and mild S3 gallop. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended with no organomegaly noted. Extremities show mild peripheral edema up to the ankles. No cyanosis or clubbing is observed.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's history of smoking, recent onset of chest pain radiating to the left arm, shortness of breath, fever, and physical examination findings, a working diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) with possible congestive heart failure is made. Further investigations are warranted to confirm this suspicion.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will undergo immediate electrocardiogram (ECG), cardiac biomarkers (troponin, CK-MB), and chest X-ray. He will be started on sublingual nitroglycerin for symptom relief and oxygen therapy via nasal cannula to maintain oxygen saturation above 92%. Intravenous access will be established for potential medication administration and fluid resuscitation. Given the urgency of his condition, he will be admitted to the cardiac care unit for close monitoring and further management.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient should return to the clinic for a follow-up appointment within one week post-discharge from the hospital for a detailed discussion of his test results, risk factor modification counseling, and initiation of secondary prevention strategies, including smoking cessation support. He will also be referred to cardiology for further evaluation and management. In the interim, he should avoid strenuous activities and maintain a low-sodium diet as recommended.
