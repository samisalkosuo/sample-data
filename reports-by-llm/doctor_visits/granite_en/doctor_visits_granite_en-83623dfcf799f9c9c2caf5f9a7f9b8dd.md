Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient, a 10-year-old female, presents with a 3-day history of progressive difficulty breathing and increasing wheezing.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient's mother reports that the child first developed a mild cough two days ago, which has since progressed to a persistent, non-productive cough. Over the past 24 hours, the patient has experienced worsening shortness of breath and audible wheezing, particularly during exertion. The symptoms have been intermittent but are becoming more frequent and severe. There is no known recent exposure to allergens or respiratory infections.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears mildly distressed but is cooperative. Vital signs reveal a temperature of 37°C, heart rate of 120 bpm, respiratory rate of 40 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on room air. Auscultation of the lungs reveals bilateral wheezing throughout inspiration and expiration, with decreased air entry at the bases. Cardiovascular examination is unremarkable.

Assessment / Diagnosis: The patient's presentation is consistent with an acute exacerbation of asthma. The severity of symptoms and the need for supplemental oxygen suggest moderate-to-severe asthmatic exacerbation.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be administered a course of systemic corticosteroids (prednisolone 2mg/kg once daily) and salbutamol nebulizer treatments as needed for bronchospasm relief. The patient's mother will be instructed on proper inhaler technique and the use of a spacer device. The patient will also receive a prescription for a short-acting beta-agonist (SABA) inhaler for home use.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient should return for a follow-up appointment in one week to reassess symptoms and adjust treatment as needed. The mother is advised to contact the clinic immediately if the patient's condition worsens or if she requires additional medication before the scheduled follow-up.
