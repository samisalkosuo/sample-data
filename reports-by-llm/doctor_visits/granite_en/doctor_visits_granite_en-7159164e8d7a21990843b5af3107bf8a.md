Clinic or Hospital Location: Kuhmoinen  

Patient Gender: Male  
Patient Age: 65  

Severity Level: 3 (Urgent – stable, needs 2+ resources)

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with progressive dyspnea and a productive cough for the past three days. He reports increased shortness of breath at rest and mild chest pain.

History of Present Illness (HPI):  
The 65-year-old male patient reports the onset of symptoms approximately three days ago, initially presenting with a dry cough and mild fatigue. Over the past 48 hours, his condition has worsened, characterized by increased dyspnea at rest, a productive cough with yellowish sputum, and intermittent chest pain described as sharp and worsening with deep breaths or coughing. He denies fever, chills, hemoptysis, or recent travel. His past medical history is significant for well-controlled hypertension and a 20-pack-year smoking history that ceased 15 years ago.

Physical Examination Findings:  
Vital signs: Blood pressure 140/90 mmHg, heart rate 98 bpm, respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation 90% on room air, temperature 37°C.  
General appearance: The patient appears moderately distressed and diaphoretic.  
HEENT: Normocephalic, atraumatic. Pupils equal, round, and reactive to light. Oropharynx clear.  
Cardiovascular: Regular rhythm, mild tachycardia. S1 and S2 audible. No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  
Lungs: Decreased breath sounds in the right lower lobe with increased fremitus and dullness to percussion. Coarse crackles heard in the same area.  
Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, no organomegaly.  
Extremities: No edema.  

Assessment / Diagnosis:  
The patient's presentation is suggestive of a lower lobe pneumonia, likely bacterial given the duration and character of symptoms, increased sputum production, and elevated white blood cell count (12,000 cells/uL) on preliminary lab results. The patient's history of smoking and hypertension may contribute to his susceptibility.

Plan / Treatment:  
1. Admit for further management and monitoring.  
2. Initiate broad-spectrum antibiotics (Ceftriaxone 500mg IV q12h) pending culture results.  
3. Administer supplemental oxygen to maintain oxygen saturation above 92%.  
4. Obtain a chest X-ray to confirm diagnosis and assess the extent of lung involvement.  
5. Start on bronchodilators (Albuterol nebulizer q4h) for symptomatic relief.  
6. Monitor for signs of respiratory decompensation or worsening hypoxemia.  

Follow-up Instructions:  
1. The patient will be closely monitored in the hospital setting, with daily reviews by the medical team.  
2. Once stabilized, a transition to outpatient management will occur, including continued antibiotics as per culture and sensitivity results.  
3. A follow-up appointment will be scheduled upon discharge for ongoing care and smoking cessation counseling.  
4. The patient should contact the clinic immediately if fever returns, symptoms worsen, or he develops new complications (e.g., hemoptysis).
