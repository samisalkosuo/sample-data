Severity Level: 3 (Urgent – stable, needs 2+ resources)  
Patient Gender: Male  
Patient Age: 40

Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with a two-day history of progressive shortness of breath and chest pain. He reports feeling increasingly fatigued and experiencing mild fever.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 40-year-old male, reports the onset of symptoms approximately 48 hours ago. He describes a gradual worsening of dyspnea, now rating his breathlessness as a 7 out of 10 at rest. The chest pain is described as a sharp, pleuritic pain, exacerbated by deep inspiration and coughing, localized to the left side. He denies any orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or lower extremity edema. He has no significant past medical history but mentions occasional marijuana use. He reports a fever of 101°F (38.3°C) over the past 24 hours, with no chills or sweats.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears mildly distressed and in moderate respiratory distress. Vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 130/80 mmHg, heart rate 95 bpm, respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation 92% on room air, and temperature 101°F (38.3°C). Lung auscultation reveals bilateral basal crackles. The remainder of the physical exam is unremarkable.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's age, acute onset of dyspnea, chest pain, fever, and pulmonary crackles, a differential diagnosis including pneumonia (e.g., atypical mycoplasma or viral), pleuritis, or even a pulmonary embolism cannot be ruled out at this time. Further investigations are warranted to determine the exact cause of his symptoms.

Plan / Treatment: 

1. Immediately order a chest X-ray to evaluate for pneumonia or pleural effusion.
2. Initiate empiric antibiotics with Levofloxacin 500mg once daily for suspected atypical bacterial infection.
3. Administer ibuprofen 400mg every 6-8 hours as needed for pain and fever control.
4. Prescribe a short course of prednisolone 40mg once daily to address potential inflammatory component, if pleurisy is confirmed.
5. Arrange follow-up in 48-72 hours or sooner if symptoms worsen or if fever persists.
6. Advise the patient to avoid strenuous activity until symptoms improve.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient should return for a follow-up appointment in 48-72 hours or sooner if his condition worsens, fever persists, or if he develops new symptoms. He should also contact the clinic immediately if he experiences worsening dyspnea, hemoptysis, or any other concerning symptoms before the scheduled follow-up.
