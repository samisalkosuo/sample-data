Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with a persistent cough and mild shortness of breath for the past two weeks. She reports increased fatigue and occasional chest discomfort, which she attributes to seasonal allergies.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 63-year-old female, has been experiencing a persistent cough with white phlegm, mild shortness of breath, and fatigue for the past two weeks. She denies any recent travel, sick contacts, or known allergies. The symptoms have been gradually worsening, prompting her to seek medical attention. She reports no significant past medical history but mentions occasional seasonal allergies without any known triggers.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears well-groomed and in mild distress due to shortness of breath. Vital signs are within normal limits. Auscultation of the lungs reveals decreased breath sounds in the right lower lobe with occasional wheezing. Cardiovascular examination is unremarkable, with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops noted. The abdomen is soft, non-tender, and bowel sounds are present. Extremities show no edema, and peripheral pulses are strong bilaterally. Neurological examination is non-contributory.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Based on the patient's history and physical examination findings, she is likely suffering from a lower respiratory tract infection, possibly exacerbated by seasonal allergies. Further evaluation with chest X-ray or CT scan may be considered if symptoms persist or worsen.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be prescribed a course of azithromycin 250mg on days 1 and 2, followed by 125mg on days 3-5 for suspected bacterial pneumonia. In addition, she will receive a short-acting bronchodilator (albuterol) via nebulizer as needed for her reported shortness of breath and wheezing. She will also be advised to use a saline nasal rinse to alleviate allergy symptoms. The patient will be scheduled for follow-up in one week if symptoms do not improve or worsen.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient is instructed to contact the clinic immediately if she experiences worsening shortness of breath, chest pain, or fever. She should also seek urgent medical attention if she develops bluish discoloration of the lips or face (cyanosis). Otherwise, she will follow up in one week for reassessment. The patient has been provided with written instructions and educational materials regarding her condition and treatment plan.
