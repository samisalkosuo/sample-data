Clinic or Hospital Location: Rovaniemi  

Patient Gender: Male  
Patient Age: 86  

Severity Level: 3 (Urgent â€“ stable, needs 2+ resources)

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with progressive dyspnea and a productive cough for the past three days. He reports increased shortness of breath at rest and orthopnea, which has led to significant sleep disturbance.

History of Present Illness (HPI): An 86-year-old male presents with a three-day history of worsening dyspnea and a productive cough with white sputum. He reports increased shortness of breath at rest, necessitating use of accessory muscles for breathing. Orthopnea has led to frequent nocturnal awakenings due to respiratory distress. There is no known history of cardiovascular disease or recent infections. He takes warfarin for atrial fibrillation and lisinopril for hypertension.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears anxious and in moderate respiratory distress. Vital signs include a blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg, heart rate of 95 bpm, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 88% on room air. Auscultation reveals bilateral basal crackles and decreased breath sounds. Cardiovascular examination shows regular rhythm with no murmurs or gallops. There is no peripheral edema.

Assessment / Diagnosis: The patient's presentation is consistent with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), likely precipitated by a lower respiratory tract infection. His history of atrial fibrillation and current anticoagulation therapy necessitate careful management to avoid hemorrhagic complications.

Plan / Treatment: 

1. Administer supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula to maintain oxygen saturation above 90%.
2. Initiate intravenous corticosteroids (methylprednisolone 40mg) and broad-spectrum antibiotics (ceftriaxone 1g and azithromycin 500mg) for suspected pneumonia.
3. Obtain chest X-ray to confirm diagnosis and assess severity of pulmonary infiltrates.
4. Monitor INR levels closely due to concurrent warfarin therapy; consider holding warfarin temporarily if INR is above the therapeutic range.
5. Arrange for close follow-up with a pulmonologist and potential referral for further management, including possible hospital admission for closer monitoring and treatment of acute exacerbation.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient should return for a follow-up appointment in one week to reassess symptoms and lung function. If there is no improvement or worsening of symptoms prior to this appointment, he should seek immediate medical attention. In the interim, he must continue monitoring his oxygen saturation levels at home and report any further decline in respiratory status promptly.
