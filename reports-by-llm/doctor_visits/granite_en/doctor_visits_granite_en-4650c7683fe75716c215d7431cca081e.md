Clinic or Hospital Location: Eckerö  

Patient Gender: Male  
Patient Age: 6 years old  

Severity Level: 5 (Non-urgent – minor complaints)

Chief Complaint: The patient, a 6-year-old male, presents with his mother for evaluation of a persistent cough and mild wheezing for the past 3 days.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient's mother reports that the child initially developed a runny nose and low-grade fever 5 days ago, which resolved over the next 2 days. However, a persistent dry cough and occasional wheezing have been present since then. The symptoms are worse at night and improve with quiet activity. There is no recent travel, sick contacts, or known allergies in the family.

Physical Examination Findings: On examination, the patient is alert and oriented to person, place, and time. Vital signs are within normal limits for age. Auscultation of the lungs reveals decreased breath sounds bilaterally with occasional wheezing heard throughout the lung fields, more prominent in the lower lobes. Cardiovascular and abdominal exams are unremarkable. The patient's oxygen saturation on room air is 98%.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Based on the history and physical examination findings, the patient likely has acute viral bronchiolitis with mild respiratory distress.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be started on supportive care, including increased fluid intake to maintain hydration and saline nebulizer treatments as needed for improved airway clearance. Parents are advised to use a cool-mist humidifier in the child's room. If symptoms worsen or there is any difficulty breathing, the patient should be reassessed immediately. The patient will be scheduled for a follow-up appointment in 7 days unless symptoms resolve sooner.

Follow-up Instructions: Please return to the clinic if the child's respiratory distress worsens or if there is any difficulty breathing. Otherwise, follow up in 7 days for reassessment. In the meantime, monitor the child's symptoms and ensure adequate hydration.
