Clinic or Hospital Location: Ruovesi  

Patient Gender: Female  
Patient Age: 63  

Severity Level: 4 (Less-urgent â€“ stable, stable, 1 resource)

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with a persistent cough and progressive shortness of breath over the past three weeks. She also reports intermittent chest pain and occasional wheezing.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 63-year-old female, reports the onset of her symptoms approximately three weeks ago. Initially, she experienced a dry cough and mild fatigue, which have since progressed to include significant shortness of breath, especially during exertion. She describes the chest pain as sharp, intermittent, and worsening with deep inspiration. The patient denies any recent travel, sick contacts, or known allergies. Her past medical history is notable for well-controlled hypertension and osteoarthritis.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears mildly distressed but is in stable condition. Vital signs are within normal limits. Auscultation of the lungs reveals decreased breath sounds bilaterally with occasional wheezing. Chest percussion elicits dullness, and there is mild expiratory wheezing. Cardiovascular examination shows regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and normoactive bowel sounds. Extremities show no edema, and peripheral pulses are intact. Neurological examination is unremarkable.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Based on the patient's history, physical examination findings, and consideration of her age and comorbidities, a working diagnosis of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is made. Further investigations, including chest X-ray and spirometry, are recommended to confirm the diagnosis and assess the severity.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be started on a short course of oral corticosteroids (prednisolone 20mg daily) and bronchodilators (salbutamol inhaler as needed for symptom relief). She will also receive instructions on proper inhaler technique. Given her stable condition, hospital admission is not indicated at this time.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient should follow up with her primary care provider or a pulmonologist within one week for reassessment of symptoms and review of investigations. She will also be scheduled for a spirometry test to evaluate lung function. If symptoms worsen before the scheduled follow-up, she should seek immediate medical attention.
