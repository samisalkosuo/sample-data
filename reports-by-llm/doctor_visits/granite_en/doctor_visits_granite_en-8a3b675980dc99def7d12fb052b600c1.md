Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with a persistent cough, shortness of breath, and intermittent chest pain for the past two weeks. He reports increased symptoms over the last 48 hours.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 47-year-old male, reports a gradual onset of a persistent dry cough, shortness of breath, and intermittent chest pain radiating to his left arm. He denies fever, chills, or night sweats. The symptoms have been progressively worsening over the past two weeks but have significantly increased in severity over the last 48 hours. He works as a construction worker and has been exposed to dust and fumes at work.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears mildly distressed. His vital signs are within normal limits, except for a respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute. Auscultation of the lungs reveals bilateral basal crackles. The patient's oxygen saturation on room air is 96%. There is mild tenderness to palpation over the left costovertebral angle, with no rebound or guarding.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's history, physical examination findings, and occupational exposure, a working diagnosis of pneumonia, possibly related to his work environment, is made. Further investigations are recommended to confirm this diagnosis and rule out other differentials such as pleural effusion or pulmonary embolism.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be started on a course of oral antibiotics (Amoxicillin-Clavulanate) and prescribed an inhaler (Salbutamol) for bronchodilatation. He will also receive a prescription for a cough suppressant (Dextromethorphan) to manage his symptoms. The patient is advised to rest at home and avoid strenuous activities until symptoms improve.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient should return for a follow-up appointment in one week or sooner if symptoms worsen. He will undergo a chest X-ray and possibly a sputum culture to confirm the diagnosis and guide further management. The patient is also advised to avoid exposure to dust and fumes until his condition improves.
