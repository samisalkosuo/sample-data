Clinic or Hospital Location: Luoto  

Patient Gender: Male  
Patient Age: 61  

Severity Level: 5 (Non-urgent â€“ minor complaints)

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with a persistent cough and mild shortness of breath for the past two weeks. He also reports occasional wheezing, especially during physical exertion.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 61-year-old male, has been experiencing a gradual onset of a dry cough and mild dyspnea over the past two weeks. He describes the cough as non-productive and worse at night. The wheezing is intermittent but noticeable during exercise. He denies any chest pain, fever, or recent travel. His only known allergy is to penicillin.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears well-groomed and in no acute distress. Vital signs are within normal limits. Auscultation of the lungs reveals bilateral wheezing, more prominent in the lower lobes. The rest of the physical exam is unremarkable.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Based on the patient's history and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of mild exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is made. The patient's symptoms are consistent with this diagnosis, given his age, smoking history (quit 15 years ago), and current presentation.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be started on a short course of a bronchodilator inhaler (albuterol) as needed for symptom relief. He will also receive a prescription for a low-dose inhaled corticosteroid to help manage underlying airway inflammation. The patient is advised to continue smoking cessation efforts and will be referred to a pulmonologist for further evaluation and management of his COPD.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient should follow up in four weeks or sooner if symptoms worsen. He will receive instructions on proper inhaler technique and the importance of regular use. He is also advised to monitor his symptoms and seek immediate medical attention if he experiences increased shortness of breath, changes in sputum color or volume, or other concerning symptoms.
