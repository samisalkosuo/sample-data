Severity Level: 2 (Emergent â€“ potential life threat)
Patient Gender: Male
Patient Age: 99

Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient, a 99-year-old male, presents with acute onset confusion and disorientation, reported by his caregiver. The patient's condition has worsened over the past 24 hours, with increasing lethargy and decreased responsiveness to verbal stimuli.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient's caregiver reports that he has had a history of mild cognitive impairment but has been relatively stable until recently. Over the past week, the patient has experienced intermittent episodes of confusion and disorientation, which have become more frequent and severe in the last 24 hours. The patient's caregiver denies any recent falls, head trauma, or changes in medication regimen.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient is oriented only to person and place but not to time. He appears lethargic and has a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 12 (Eye opening: E4V4, Verbal: 3, Motor: 6). Vital signs are within normal limits, except for a mild tachycardia at 95 beats per minute. The patient's neurological examination is notable for a decreased level of consciousness and a positive Rinne test on the right side, suggesting possible right-sided sensorineural hearing loss.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's age, acute onset confusion, altered mental status, and positive Rinne test, a differential diagnosis of acute stroke (specifically, a right-sided cerebrovascular accident) or an alternative etiology such as a right-sided space-occupying lesion is considered. Further diagnostic workup is warranted to confirm the diagnosis and guide management.

Plan / Treatment:
1. Immediate non-contrast head computed tomography (CT) scan to rule out acute hemorrhage or mass effect.
2. Initiate supportive care, including close monitoring of vital signs and neurological status.
3. Consult with neurology for further evaluation and management.
4. Consider antithrombotic therapy if ischemic stroke is confirmed.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the facility for at least 24 hours following the initial assessment. A follow-up appointment will be scheduled once the diagnostic workup results are available, and a more definitive management plan can be established. The caregiver should be advised to maintain close observation of the patient's symptoms and report any changes in mental status or neurological function promptly.
