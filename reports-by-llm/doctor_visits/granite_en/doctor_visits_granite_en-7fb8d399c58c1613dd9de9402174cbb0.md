Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient, a 76-year-old female, presents with a chief complaint of persistent, non-painful swelling in her left lower leg, which she has noticed over the past two weeks. She reports no recent injuries or trauma to the area.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient describes the swelling as gradually increasing in size, with no associated pain, redness, or warmth. She denies any history of similar episodes. Her medical history is significant for hypertension and peripheral arterial disease, both well-controlled on current medications. She reports no recent changes in her medication regimen.

Physical Examination Findings: On examination, the patient's vital signs are within normal limits. The left lower leg reveals a non-erythematous, firm, and slightly elevated area measuring approximately 5 cm in diameter, located at the anterior-medial aspect. There is no palpable cord or bruit noted. The patient's pulses are intact bilaterally, and her skin temperature is normal.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Based on the patient's history, physical examination findings, and considering her age and medical background, a likely diagnosis of lipedema is considered. Lipedema is a chronic, progressive lymphatic disorder characterized by painless, symmetric, and non-pitting bilateral leg edema, predominantly affecting women.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be referred to a vascular specialist for further evaluation and management of her condition. In the interim, she will continue her current medications for hypertension and peripheral arterial disease. Compression stockings may be recommended by the specialist to help alleviate symptoms.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient is scheduled for a follow-up appointment in four weeks to reassess her condition and discuss the results of the vascular specialist consultation. She should contact our clinic immediately if she experiences any worsening symptoms, such as increased pain, discoloration, or warmth in the affected area.
