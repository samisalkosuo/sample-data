Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with a 48-hour history of progressive lower abdominal pain, fever, and dysuria. She reports difficulty urinating and passing small amounts of blood in her urine.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient is a 20-year-old female who first noticed mild lower abdominal discomfort two days ago. Over the past 24 hours, the pain has become more severe, sharp, and constant, radiating to the back. She also reports a low-grade fever, chills, and frequent urination accompanied by burning sensation. Notably, she mentions passing small amounts of blood in her urine. She denies any vaginal discharge or abnormal vaginal bleeding.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears moderately distressed but is stable. Her vital signs are within normal limits except for a temperature of 38°C (100.4°F). Abdominal examination reveals tenderness in the lower quadrants with rebound tenderness, guarding, and mild costovertebral angle tenderness. No organomegaly is noted. Digital rectal examination elicits no abnormalities. Urinalysis shows pyuria (white blood cells) and hematuria (red blood cells).

Assessment / Diagnosis: Based on the patient's presentation, history, and physical examination findings, she is likely suffering from a urinary tract infection (UTI) with possible signs of potential pyelonephritis. Further diagnostic workup, including urine culture and sensitivity, is recommended to confirm this diagnosis and guide antibiotic therapy.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be prescribed a broad-spectrum antibiotic (e.g., Ceftriaxone 1g IV once, followed by Oral Ciprofloxacin 500mg twice daily for a total of 7 days) to address the suspected bacterial infection. She will also be advised to increase fluid intake and maintain warmth to alleviate discomfort. Pain management with over-the-counter analgesics (e.g., Ibuprofen 400mg up to three times daily or as needed) is recommended.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient should return for a follow-up appointment in 48 hours following the initiation of antibiotic therapy to reassess symptoms and review urine culture results. If there is no improvement or if symptoms worsen, she must return immediately for further evaluation. Additionally, she should contact the clinic if she develops fever, flank pain, nausea, vomiting, or other concerning symptoms before her scheduled follow-up.
