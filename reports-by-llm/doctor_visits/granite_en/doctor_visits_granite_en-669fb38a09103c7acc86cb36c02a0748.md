Visit Date: 02.11.2023  
Clinic or Hospital Location: Hammarland  

Patient Gender: Male  
Patient Age: 32  

Severity Level: 3 (Urgent – stable, needs 2+ resources)

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with a 3-day history of progressive shortness of breath and a persistent dry cough. He reports mild chest pain exacerbated by deep inspiration and position changes.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 32-year-old male, reports the onset of symptoms approximately three days ago. Initially, he experienced a mild sore throat and fatigue, which progressed to include shortness of breath, dry cough, and intermittent chest pain. He denies fever, chills, or night sweats. The patient's symptoms have been gradually worsening, prompting his current visit. He has no significant past medical history but is a non-smoker with occasional alcohol use.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears mildly distressed and in moderate respiratory distress. Vital signs are as follows: temperature 98.6°F (37°C), blood pressure 130/85 mmHg, heart rate 95 bpm, respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 92% on room air. Auscultation reveals bilateral basal crackles and decreased breath sounds in the lower lobes. Cardiovascular examination shows tachycardia with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. There is no peripheral edema noted.

Assessment / Diagnosis: The patient's presentation is concerning for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), given his age, symptoms, and physical examination findings. Further diagnostic testing, including a chest X-ray and blood work (complete blood count, inflammatory markers, and blood cultures if indicated), will be pursued to confirm the diagnosis and guide management.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will receive a course of intravenous antibiotics (e.g., ceftriaxone) targeting common CAP pathogens. He will also receive intravenous hydration, cough suppressants for symptom relief, and bronchodilators as needed to alleviate shortness of breath. Oxygen therapy will be administered as required to maintain oxygen saturation above 92%.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient should return for a follow-up appointment in one week to assess symptom resolution and review diagnostic test results. He must also complete the full course of prescribed antibiotics, even if symptoms improve before completion. If symptoms worsen or do not improve as expected, he should seek immediate medical attention.
