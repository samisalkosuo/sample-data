Patient Age: 77

Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with a persistent, non-healing ulcer on the right heel, accompanied by mild intermittent pain and occasional swelling.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The 77-year-old male reports that the ulcer has been present for approximately six weeks. He first noticed it after a minor injury while walking, which he initially disregarded due to its small size. Over time, the ulcer has shown minimal improvement and has become more painful with daily activities. The patient denies any systemic symptoms such as fever, chills, or night sweats. He has a history of peripheral artery disease (PAD) and diabetes mellitus type 2, both well-controlled on medication.

Physical Examination Findings: On examination, the patient is alert and oriented to person, place, and time. Vital signs are within normal limits. The right lower extremity reveals a well-defined, indurated ulcer measuring approximately 1 cm in diameter and 0.5 cm in depth, located on the plantar aspect of the heel. The surrounding skin shows mild erythema and edema. There is no evidence of infection, such as purulent discharge or warmth. Distal pulses are palpable bilaterally, and pedal pulses are symmetric.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Based on the patient's history, physical examination findings, and known medical conditions, the ulcer is likely a diabetic neuropathic ulcer secondary to peripheral artery disease. The patient's well-controlled PAD and diabetes suggest a non-infected, chronic wound.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be started on a topical antibiotic ointment (moxifloxacin) twice daily for seven days to address any potential bacterial contamination. Additionally, he will be prescribed a compression wrap to promote healing and reduce swelling. The patient will be referred to a podiatrist for further evaluation and possible debridement of the ulcer. He will also continue his current medications for diabetes and PAD as prescribed.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient is scheduled for a follow-up appointment in two weeks for wound assessment and treatment plan adjustment, if necessary. He should monitor the ulcer daily for signs of infection or worsening and contact the clinic immediately if he notices any changes.
