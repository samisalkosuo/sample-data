Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with a persistent, non-healing wound on her right ankle following a minor injury two weeks ago. She also reports mild intermittent pain and swelling in the affected area.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The 28-year-old female patient reports sustaining a minor cut on her right ankle while walking barefoot at home approximately two weeks ago. Initially, she applied over-the-counter antiseptic cream and covered the wound with a bandage. Despite these efforts, the wound has shown minimal improvement and remains open, with mild redness, swelling, and occasional pain. She denies any systemic symptoms such as fever or chills.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient is alert and oriented. The right ankle exhibits a 2 cm oval-shaped wound with well-defined borders, surrounded by mild erythema and edema. There is no evidence of purulent discharge or signs of infection. Range of motion is within normal limits, but the patient reports tenderness to palpation over the wound area.

Assessment / Diagnosis: The patient presents with a chronic, non-healing wound likely due to poor wound care and possible secondary bacterial colonization. Given the absence of systemic symptoms and lack of signs of acute infection, the diagnosis is a chronic, infected wound (wound infection).

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be prescribed mupirocin ointment to apply topically twice daily for one week. She will also be instructed on proper wound care techniques, including cleansing the area with saline solution and changing dressings regularly. If there is no improvement after this treatment period, she should return for further evaluation.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient is advised to return in one week for a follow-up appointment to assess wound healing progress. She should continue practicing meticulous wound care and report any signs of increased redness, swelling, pain, or discharge promptly.
