Clinic or Hospital Location: Hailuoto  

Patient Gender: Male  
Patient Age: 60  

Severity Level: 3 (Urgent â€“ stable, needs 2+ resources)

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with progressive dyspnea and chest discomfort of one-week duration.

History of Present Illness (HPI):  
The patient, a 60-year-old male, reports the onset of progressive shortness of breath (dyspnea) and intermittent chest discomfort approximately one week ago. The dyspnea is exacerbated by minimal exertion and improves with rest. He denies any cough, hemoptysis, or fever. There's no significant past medical history of cardiovascular diseases but he has a history of smoking (30 pack-years) and recently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus managed with metformin.

Physical Examination Findings:  
Vital signs: Blood pressure 148/92 mmHg, heart rate 98 bpm, respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation 90% on room air.  
General appearance: The patient appears anxious and in moderate distress.  
HEENT: Normocephalic, atraumatic. Pupils equal, round, and reactive to light. Oropharynx clear.  
Cardiovascular: Regular rhythm, S1 and S2 audible. No murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Bilateral fine crackles heard in lung bases.  
Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, non-distended.  
Extremities: No edema noted.  

Assessment / Diagnosis:  
The patient's presentation of progressive dyspnea, chest discomfort, and tachypnea along with a history of smoking and recent diabetes diagnosis raises concern for acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or possible pneumonia. Further investigations are warranted to rule out other differentials such as heart failure or pulmonary embolism.

Plan / Treatment:  
1. Order immediate arterial blood gas analysis to assess oxygenation and ventilation status.
2. Administer supplemental oxygen via non-rebreather mask to maintain SpO8 at >90%.
3. Initiate a course of intravenous corticosteroids (e.g., methylprednisolone 40 mg) and broad-spectrum antibiotics (e.g., ceftriaxone 2 g IV q12h) pending culture results.
4. Arrange for chest X-ray and consider CT scan of the chest if indicated by clinical suspicion.
5. Consult with a pulmonologist or cardiologist as needed.
6. Optimize diabetes management, including monitoring blood glucose levels closely.
7. Provide patient education on smoking cessation and the importance of adherence to prescribed medications.

Follow-up Instructions:  
The patient should return for a follow-up appointment in one week or sooner if symptoms worsen, new symptoms develop, or there is any concern regarding his condition. He will also need close monitoring of his respiratory status and response to treatment, which may include additional clinic visits or telehealth consultations as deemed necessary by the treating physician.
