Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient, an 8-year-old male, presents with a 3-day history of progressive difficulty breathing and increasing wheezing. The parent reports that the child has had several similar episodes in the past, all managed with a prescribed inhaler.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient's symptoms began 3 days ago with occasional wheezing during physical activity. Over the past 48 hours, the wheezing has become more frequent and severe, now present at rest and significantly impairing his ability to perform daily activities. The parent reports that the child has used his prescribed albuterol inhaler as directed, with minimal improvement in symptoms.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient is in mild respiratory distress, using accessory muscles to breathe. Auscultation reveals bilateral wheezing throughout inspiration and expiration. Vital signs are as follows: temperature 98.6°F (37°C), heart rate 120/min, respiratory rate 40/min, blood pressure 105/65 mmHg, and oxygen saturation 92% on room air.

Assessment / Diagnosis: The patient's presentation is consistent with an acute exacerbation of asthma. The severity of symptoms and the need for increased respiratory support suggest a moderate to severe asthmatic episode.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will receive a course of systemic corticosteroids (prednisolone 2 mg/kg/day divided into two doses for 5 days) and a short-acting beta-agonist (salbuterol) as needed for rescue therapy. The parent will be instructed on proper inhaler technique and the importance of adherence to the prescribed medication regimen. The patient will also receive a prescription for a long-term controller medication (inhaled cromolyn sodium twice daily) to help prevent future exacerbations.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient should return for a follow-up appointment in 1 week to assess symptom improvement and medication efficacy. If symptoms worsen or recur before the scheduled follow-up, the parent should contact the clinic immediately for further evaluation and management.
