Chief Complaint:
The patient, a 59-year-old male, presents with progressive dyspnea and wheezing for the past two weeks, exacerbated over the last 48 hours.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient reports a history of smoking (30 pack-years) and has been experiencing intermittent shortness of breath for several months. Over the past two weeks, his symptoms have worsened, with increased frequency of episodes and reduced exercise tolerance. In the last 48 hours, he developed paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea and orthopnea, leading to his current presentation. He denies any chest pain, cough, fever, or recent weight loss.

Physical Examination Findings:
Vital signs: Blood pressure 140/90 mmHg, heart rate 110 bpm, respiratory rate 24 breaths/min, oxygen saturation 88% on room air. The patient appears anxious and in moderate distress. Auscultation reveals bilateral wheezing throughout respiration, with prolonged expiration and use of accessory muscles. Cardiovascular examination shows tachycardia, irregular rhythm, and a loud, systolic murmur heard best at the left sternal border. Lower extremities show mild pitting edema up to the knees.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
The patient's presentation is consistent with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), likely precipitated by a possible pneumonia or respiratory infection. The severity level of 3 indicates the need for urgent intervention to stabilize his condition and prevent further deterioration.

Plan / Treatment:
1. Administer supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula to maintain oxygen saturation above 90%.
2. Initiate intravenous corticosteroids (methylprednisolone 40 mg) and broad-spectrum antibiotics (ceftriaxone 2 g and azithromycin 500 mg) to address potential infection and inflammation.
3. Administer bronchodilators (salbutamol nebulizer) for immediate symptom relief.
4. Arrange for chest X-ray and complete blood count (CBC) with differential to further evaluate for pneumonia or other complications.
5. Consult with a pulmonologist for further management and potential referral to the hospital for closer monitoring and possible mechanical ventilation if needed.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient should follow up with his primary care physician within 48 hours for ongoing management and assessment of response to treatment. If symptoms worsen or do not improve, he should seek immediate medical attention. The patient is advised to quit smoking and consider participation in a pulmonary rehabilitation program for better disease management.
