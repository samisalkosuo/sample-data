06.05.2025 - Rauma Clinic Visit Report

Chief Complaint: A 3-year-old female patient presents with a 3-day history of fever, lethargy, and decreased oral intake.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient's mother reports that her daughter has been febrile for the past three days, with temperatures ranging from 39°C to 40°C. The child has shown decreased activity levels and reduced oral intake, leading to mild dehydration. No cough, sore throat, or respiratory distress is noted. The patient's immunization history is up-to-date, and there is no recent travel or exposure to sick contacts.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears lethargic but responsive. Her vital signs are as follows: temperature 39.2°C, heart rate 140 bpm, respiratory rate 36 breaths/min, and blood pressure 85/50 mmHg. The child's mucous membranes are dry, and her skin turgor is reduced. Abdominal examination reveals mild tenderness in the right upper quadrant without rebound or guarding. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's age, fever, lethargy, decreased oral intake, and mild dehydration, along with tenderness in the right upper quadrant, a working diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis is considered. This assessment aligns with severity level 2 (emergent - potential life threat) due to the risk of sepsis and renal compromise in pediatric patients.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be started on intravenous fluid resuscitation with normal saline to address dehydration. Blood tests, including a complete blood count and urinalysis, will be ordered. Empiric antibiotics (ceftriaxone and amikacin) will be initiated pending culture results. The patient will be admitted for further monitoring and treatment.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will require close monitoring during her hospital stay. Once clinical improvement is noted, a transition to oral antibiotics will be considered. A follow-up appointment will be scheduled before discharge to ensure resolution of symptoms and assess renal function. The mother will be educated on signs of worsening condition and the importance of completing the full course of antibiotics.
