30.04.2024, Geta Clinic Visit Report:

Chief Complaint: A 2-year-old male presenting with acute onset respiratory distress and wheezing.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient is a 2-year-old male who presented today with acute onset respiratory distress, characterized by increased respiratory rate (60 breaths per minute), nasal flaring, and retractions. The symptoms began approximately 12 hours ago and have progressively worsened. The child has a history of atopic dermatitis but no known allergies to medications. There is no recent upper respiratory infection reported.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears anxious and in moderate distress. Vital signs are as follows: temperature 98.6°F (37°C), heart rate 160 bpm, respiratory rate 60 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation 88% on room air, and blood pressure 90/50 mmHg. Auscultation reveals bilateral wheezing throughout inspiration and expiration, with increased audibility in the lower lung fields. No other abnormal findings are noted upon further examination.

Assessment / Diagnosis: The patient's presentation is consistent with a severe asthma exacerbation, likely triggered by an atopic predisposition and possible viral respiratory infection.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will receive immediate treatment with nebulized budesonide/formoterol (2 puffs) and systemic dexamethasone (0.6 mg orally). Continuous albuterol nebulizations will be administered as needed to control symptoms. Intravenous fluids will be initiated for hydration. The patient will be closely monitored in the observation unit for at least 4 hours post-treatment.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will require a follow-up appointment with a pediatric allergist/immunologist within one week to discuss long-term asthma management and potential allergy testing. Parents are advised to contact the clinic immediately if the patient's respiratory status deteriorates or if new symptoms develop.
