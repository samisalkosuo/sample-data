Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient is brought in by his parents for a consultation regarding recurrent respiratory infections and wheezing.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 3-year-old male, has been experiencing recurrent episodes of wheezing and coughing, particularly at night, over the past three months. These episodes are often triggered by common cold symptoms or exposure to allergens like dust mites. The parents report that the patient requires frequent nebulized bronchodilators for symptom relief. There is no history of fever, chest wall deformity, or recent travel.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears well-nourished and in no acute distress. His vital signs are within normal limits. Auscultation reveals bilateral wheezing more prominent in the lower lung fields. There is no evidence of retractions or prolonged expiratory phase. Cardiovascular and abdominal examinations are unremarkable.

Assessment / Diagnosis: The patient's history, physical examination findings, and pattern of symptoms are suggestive of asthma. The recurrent nature of the respiratory episodes, nocturnal wheezing, and response to bronchodilators further support this diagnosis.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be started on a daily low-dose inhaled corticosteroid (e.g., fluticasone 50 mcg) along with an albuterol rescue inhaler for acute symptoms. Parents will be instructed on proper inhaler technique and the importance of adherence to medication regimen. A follow-up appointment is scheduled in four weeks for reassessment. The patient will also undergo allergy testing to identify potential triggers and guide environmental modifications at home.

Follow-up Instructions: Please return in four weeks for a follow-up visit to assess the response to treatment and adjust the management plan as necessary. In the interim, continue to monitor symptoms and administer prescribed medications as directed. If there are any worsening symptoms or new onset of severe respiratory distress, seek immediate medical attention.
