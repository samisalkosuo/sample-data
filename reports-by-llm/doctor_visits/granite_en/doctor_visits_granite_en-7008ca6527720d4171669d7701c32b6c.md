Clinic or Hospital Location: Uurainen  

Patient Gender: Male  
Patient Age: 33  

Severity Level: 4 (Less-urgent â€“ stable, stable, 1 resource)

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with a persistent cough, shortness of breath, and intermittent chest pain for the past two weeks. He reports increased fatigue and occasional wheezing.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The 33-year-old male patient reports the onset of symptoms approximately two weeks ago. Initially, he experienced a dry cough, which has since become productive with yellowish sputum. He describes his shortness of breath as exertional, worsening with minimal activity. The chest pain is described as sharp, intermittent, and localized to the left side, aggravated by deep inspiration or coughing. He denies any fever, night sweats, or weight loss.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears well-groomed but visibly fatigued. Vital signs are within normal limits. Auscultation reveals decreased breath sounds in the left lower lung fields with occasional wheezing. Percussion elicits dullness, and percussion note is hyperresonant, suggesting possible pneumothorax or pleural effusion. There are no other significant findings on cardiovascular or abdominal examination.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Based on the patient's history and physical examination findings, a working diagnosis of pneumonia with possible left-sided pleural effusion is considered. Further diagnostic testing, including chest X-ray and possibly CT scan, is recommended to confirm this suspicion.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be prescribed a course of oral antibiotics (e.g., Levofloxacin 500mg once daily for 7 days) targeting common respiratory pathogens. He will also receive a short-acting bronchodilator inhaler (e.g., Albuterol) for symptomatic relief of wheezing and dyspnea. The patient is advised to rest and increase fluid intake.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient should return for a follow-up appointment in one week to reassess his condition, review symptoms, and ensure appropriate response to treatment. If there is no improvement or if symptoms worsen before the scheduled follow-up, he should seek immediate medical attention. A chest X-ray will be reviewed at the follow-up visit to confirm resolution of the suspected pneumonia and pleural effusion.
