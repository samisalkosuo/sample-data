Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with a chief complaint of progressive dyspnea and lower extremity edema.

History of Present Illness (HPI): A 90-year-old male patient reports a gradual onset of shortness of breath over the past two weeks, initially attributed to exertion but now occurring with minimal activity. He also mentions bilateral lower extremity swelling, worsening over the last few days. There is no history of fever, chest pain, or cough. The patient has a known history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and mild renal impairment.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient appears alert and oriented to person, place, and time. Vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 130/80 mmHg, heart rate 90 beats per minute, respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation 88% on room air, and temperature 98.6°F. The patient is in mild distress due to dyspnea. Lungs reveal bilateral basal crackles, and there is decreased breath sounds. Cardiovascular examination shows regular rhythm with a grade III/VI holosystolic murmur heard best at the apex. Abdominal examination is unremarkable, while lower extremities show 2+ pitting edema up to the knees.

Assessment / Diagnosis: The patient's symptoms and physical findings are suggestive of acute exacerbation of COPD with congestive heart failure (CHF) superimposed on his pre-existing conditions. Laboratory results indicate elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels, confirming the diagnosis of CHF.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be initiated on systemic corticosteroids and bronchodilators for acute exacerbation of COPD. Intravenous diuretics will be administered to manage fluid overload associated with CHF. Oxygen therapy via nasal cannula will be provided to maintain oxygen saturation above 90%. Further investigations, including chest X-ray and echocardiogram, are recommended to assess the extent of cardiac involvement.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient should follow up with his primary care physician within one week for ongoing management of COPD exacerbation and CHF. He will also be referred to a cardiologist for further evaluation and management of his heart failure. Regular monitoring of weight, fluid status, and response to treatment is advised. The patient should avoid unnecessary exertion and maintain close contact with the healthcare team for any worsening symptoms.
