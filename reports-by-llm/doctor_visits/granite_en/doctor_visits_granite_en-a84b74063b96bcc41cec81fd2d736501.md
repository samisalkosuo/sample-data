Visit Summary:

Chief Complaint: The patient presents with a persistent, non-healing ulcer on the left lower leg, accompanied by mild intermittent pain and occasional swelling.

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 57-year-old male, reports the onset of a small, red, non-blanching lesion on his left lower leg approximately two months ago. Initially, he noticed a minor cut, but it failed to heal as expected. Over time, the area enlarged and developed a black center, accompanied by mild discomfort and occasional swelling. The patient denies any history of trauma, diabetes, or peripheral arterial disease. He is otherwise well, with no significant past medical history.

Physical Examination Findings: On presentation, the patient is alert and oriented. Vital signs are within normal limits. Inspection reveals a 2 cm ulcer on the dorsal aspect of the left lower leg, with a black eschar center, well-defined borders, and mild surrounding erythema. There is no evidence of regional lymphadenopathy or distal pulses abnormalities.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Based on the clinical presentation and physical examination findings, the patient's ulcer is consistent with a venous ulcer, likely secondary to chronic venous insufficiency. The mild pain and occasional swelling are attributed to inflammation and venous hypertension.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be prescribed a topical antiseptic cream for daily application and advised to elevate the affected limb when possible. Compression stockings (class II) will be recommended for long-term management of venous insufficiency. A referral to a vascular specialist for further evaluation and potential compression therapy is suggested.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient should return in four weeks for a follow-up assessment, at which point the wound's healing progress will be re-evaluated. If there is no significant improvement or if complications arise (e.g., increased pain, worsening swelling, fever), the patient should seek immediate medical attention.
