Chief Complaint: Acute abdominal pain and vomiting

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 24-year-old male, presented to the emergency department with a 6-hour history of severe, constant abdominal pain localized in the lower right quadrant. The pain radiates to the back and is accompanied by frequent vomiting. He reports feeling nauseous and experiencing fever, chills, and loss of appetite. The patient denies any trauma or recent surgery.

Physical Examination Findings: Vital signs reveal a temperature of 38.5°C (101.3°F), pulse rate of 110 beats per minute, blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute. Abdominal examination reveals tenderness in the lower right quadrant with guarding and rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds are hypoactive.

Assessment / Diagnosis: The patient's presentation suggests an acute appendicitis, a less-urgent condition requiring prompt medical attention due to the potential for complications.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be admitted for further evaluation and management. Initial treatment includes intravenous fluids, pain medication, and antibiotics. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and ultrasound will be performed to confirm the diagnosis. Surgical consultation is anticipated due to the severity of symptoms.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the hospital. A surgical procedure may be scheduled within 24 hours if the diagnosis is confirmed. Follow-up appointments with the general surgeon and primary care provider will be arranged upon discharge from the hospital.
