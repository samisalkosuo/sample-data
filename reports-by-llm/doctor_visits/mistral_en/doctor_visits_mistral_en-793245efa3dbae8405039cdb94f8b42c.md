Chief Complaint: Acute Respiratory Distress and Severe Hypotension

History of Present Illness (HPI): A 95-year-old female presented to the emergency department with a sudden onset of shortness of breath, coughing, and chest discomfort over the past few hours. She also reported feeling lightheaded and experiencing dizziness upon standing, accompanied by a significant drop in blood pressure. The patient has a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

Physical Examination Findings: Upon arrival, the patient was visibly distressed, with an oxygen saturation level of 88% on room air. Her blood pressure was 70/40 mmHg, pulse rate was 120 beats per minute, and respiratory rate was 30 breaths per minute. Auscultation revealed decreased breath sounds bilaterally with crackles in the lower lung fields, and a weak, irregular pulse was palpated.

Assessment / Diagnosis: The patient's presentation is consistent with an acute exacerbation of COPD complicated by pneumonia and hypotension. This constitutes a severe emergency situation due to the potential for rapid deterioration.

Plan / Treatment: The patient was immediately started on high-flow oxygen therapy, intravenous antibiotics, and intravenous fluids for volume resuscitation. A non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) mask was applied to help manage her respiratory distress.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the intensive care unit (ICU). A chest X-ray and arterial blood gas analysis will be performed to further evaluate her condition. The patient's family has been informed of the critical nature of her illness and the need for ongoing supportive care. Further updates will be provided as the situation develops.
