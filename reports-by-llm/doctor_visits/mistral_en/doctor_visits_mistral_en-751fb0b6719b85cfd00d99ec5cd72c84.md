Chief Complaint: Acute abdominal pain and shortness of breath

History of Present Illness (HPI): A 40-year-old female presented to the emergency department with a chief complaint of severe, constant abdominal pain that began abruptly 6 hours ago. The patient also reported difficulty breathing, with shortness of breath occurring over the past hour. She described the pain as sharp and localized in the lower right quadrant of her abdomen, accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and a fever of 38.5°C (101.3°F). The patient's medical history includes hypertension, for which she is currently on medication.

Physical Examination Findings: Upon examination, the patient appeared distressed with a tachycardia of 120 beats per minute and a respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute. Abdominal examination revealed localized tenderness in the lower right quadrant, with guarding and rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds were hypoactive. The patient's abdomen was distended, and there was no signs of peritonitis.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the acute onset of severe abdominal pain, localized to the right lower quadrant, accompanied by fever, tachycardia, and shortness of breath, the patient is suspected to have an appendicitis with possible perforation. The patient's hypertension may be contributing to her current condition.

Plan / Treatment: The patient was immediately admitted for intravenous fluid resuscitation, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and pain management. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis was ordered to confirm the diagnosis and assess for possible perforation or abscess formation. Surgical consultation was requested for potential appendectomy.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the hospital's intensive care unit. A surgical team will evaluate her condition, and a decision regarding appendectomy will be made based on the CT scan results. The patient should expect to remain hospitalized for several days post-surgery for recovery and monitoring. Follow-up appointments with both the surgeon and primary care provider will be scheduled upon discharge.
