Chief Complaint: Acute shortness of breath and chest pain

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, an 80-year-old male, presented to the emergency department with a sudden onset of severe shortness of breath and sharp, persistent chest pain that radiates to his left arm. He reports experiencing these symptoms for approximately 2 hours prior to arrival. The patient also mentions feeling lightheaded and profuse sweating. His medical history includes hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, and a previous myocardial infarction 5 years ago.

Physical Examination Findings: Upon initial assessment, the patient appears anxious and in distress. Vital signs reveal a heart rate of 120 bpm, blood pressure of 160/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 88% on room air, and temperature of 37.5°C (99.5°F). Auscultation of the heart reveals a regular tachycardia with an audible S4 gallop. Lungs exhibit bilateral crackles, particularly in the lower lobes.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's history and current symptoms, it is suspected that he may be experiencing an acute decompensation of his congestive heart failure or a possible recurrent myocardial infarction.

Plan / Treatment: The patient was immediately administered oxygen via nasal cannula at 6 L/min and morphine for pain management. An electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed, which showed ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads, consistent with an acute myocardial infarction. The patient was subsequently transferred to the cardiac catheterization laboratory for urgent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored during his hospital stay and undergo further diagnostic tests as needed. He is expected to remain in the hospital for several days following the PCI procedure. A follow-up appointment with a cardiologist will be scheduled upon discharge, along with recommendations for medication adjustments and lifestyle modifications.
