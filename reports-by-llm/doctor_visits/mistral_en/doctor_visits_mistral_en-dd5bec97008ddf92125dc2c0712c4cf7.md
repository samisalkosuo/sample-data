History of Present Illness (HPI): A 22-year-old female presented to the emergency department with a two-day history of progressive, severe abdominal pain localized primarily in the lower right quadrant. The pain is constant, sharp, and aggravated by movement or deep breathing. Accompanying symptoms include nausea, vomiting, and low-grade fever. She denies any history of trauma, recent travel, or contact with sick individuals.

Physical Examination Findings: Vital signs reveal a temperature of 38.1°C (100.6°F), pulse rate of 110 beats per minute, blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute. Abdominal examination reveals tenderness and guarding in the lower right quadrant with rebound tenderness on palpation. Bowel sounds are hypoactive.

Assessment / Diagnosis: The patient's presentation is concerning for appendicitis, a surgical emergency requiring prompt evaluation and intervention.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be admitted to the hospital for further evaluation and management. Initial treatment includes intravenous fluids, pain medication, and antibiotics to prevent potential complications. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and ultrasound will be performed to confirm the diagnosis.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be seen by a general surgeon for further management. Surgical intervention is expected within 24 hours of admission, depending on the results of imaging studies. The patient should notify her primary care provider upon discharge for follow-up and postoperative care instructions.
