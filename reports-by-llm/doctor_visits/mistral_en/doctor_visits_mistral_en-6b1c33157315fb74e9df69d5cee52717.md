Chief Complaint: Acute shortness of breath and chest pain

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 61-year-old female, presented to the emergency department with complaints of sudden onset of severe chest pain and dyspnea. The symptoms began approximately 2 hours ago while she was at home. She described the chest pain as a crushing sensation in the center of her chest that radiated to her left arm. Accompanying symptoms include profuse sweating, nausea, and lightheadedness. Her medical history includes hypertension and type II diabetes mellitus.

Physical Examination Findings: Upon initial assessment, the patient appeared anxious and in distress. Vital signs revealed a heart rate of 120 beats per minute, blood pressure of 160/95 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 88% on room air. Auscultation of the chest revealed a systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border. Lung examination revealed bilateral crackles.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, and medical history, an acute coronary syndrome is suspected. Specifically, the presentation suggests possible ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).

Plan / Treatment: The patient was immediately transferred to the cardiac catheterization laboratory for urgent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Aspirin, clopidogrel, and heparin were administered en route. Oxygen therapy was initiated to improve oxygen saturation levels.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the cardiac care unit post-procedure. Follow-up appointments with the cardiologist and primary care physician will be scheduled for further management and risk factor modification. The patient is advised to continue all prescribed medications as directed and to seek immediate medical attention if symptoms recur or worsen.
