Severity Level: 5 (Non-urgent)
Patient Gender: Female
Patient Age: 39

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with a persistent, non-productive cough and mild shortness of breath over the past week.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient reported that her symptoms began gradually, with a dry, hacking cough that worsened throughout the day. She also noted occasional wheezing and mild dyspnea, particularly when exerting herself. The symptoms have persisted despite over-the-counter cough suppressants and expectorants. There is no associated fever, chest pain, or hemoptysis.

Physical Examination Findings:
Upon examination, the patient appeared comfortable and was afebrile. Her respiratory rate was 20 breaths per minute, with mildly increased respirations. Auscultation of the lungs revealed scattered wheezes bilaterally. The rest of the physical exam was unremarkable.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a preliminary diagnosis of asthma exacerbation is suspected. However, further diagnostic tests may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential causes of the patient's respiratory symptoms.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient will be started on a short-acting bronchodilator for immediate relief of her symptoms. She will also receive an inhaled corticosteroid to reduce inflammation in the airways and prevent further exacerbations. The patient should follow up with her primary care provider within one week to reassess her symptoms and adjust her medication regimen as needed.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient is advised to continue taking her prescribed medications as directed and to return for a follow-up appointment within one week. She should also monitor her symptoms closely and seek immediate medical attention if her shortness of breath worsens or if she develops fever, chest pain, or hemoptysis. The patient was provided with written instructions regarding her medication regimen and follow-up appointment.
