Chief Complaint: Acute abdominal pain and vomiting

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 39-year-old female, presented to the emergency department with a 6-hour history of severe, constant, and localized lower abdominal pain that radiates to her back. She also reported multiple episodes of non-bloody vomiting. The pain is accompanied by fever (38.5°C) and leukocytosis (14,000 cells/mm³). The patient denies any history of trauma or recent surgery.

Physical Examination Findings: On examination, the patient appears distressed but coherent. Vital signs show tachycardia (heart rate 120 bpm) and mild hypertension (blood pressure 150/90 mmHg). Abdominal exam reveals tenderness in the lower left quadrant with guarding and rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds are hypoactive.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, and laboratory results, a diagnosis of acute appendicitis is suspected. The severity level is 3 (Urgent) due to the presence of localized abdominal pain, fever, leukocytosis, and signs of peritoneal irritation.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be admitted for further evaluation and management. Initial treatment includes intravenous fluid resuscitation, analgesia, and antibiotics. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis will be ordered to confirm the diagnosis and assess for any complications. Surgical consultation is recommended due to the severity of symptoms.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the hospital. Surgery may be performed within 24 hours if the CT scan confirms appendicitis. Postoperative follow-up will be scheduled with the general surgeon and primary care provider as needed. The patient should contact her healthcare team immediately if symptoms worsen or if she experiences fever, persistent vomiting, or abdominal distension.
