Chief Complaint: Acute abdominal pain and vomiting

History of Present Illness (HPI): A 55-year-old female presented to the emergency department with a two-day history of progressively worsening, localized lower abdominal pain accompanied by repeated episodes of non-bloody vomiting. The patient reported that the pain was constant and sharp in nature, exacerbated by movement and alleviated slightly by lying still. She also mentioned experiencing mild fever, loss of appetite, and feeling generally unwell.

Physical Examination Findings: On examination, the patient appeared uncomfortable but alert. Vital signs revealed a temperature of 38.2°C (100.8°F), blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg, pulse rate of 105 beats per minute, and respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute. Abdominal examination revealed tenderness in the lower left quadrant with guarding and rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds were hypoactive.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a provisional diagnosis of acute appendicitis is suspected. The severity level is 2 (Emergent) due to the potential life threat posed by this condition if left untreated.

Plan / Treatment: The patient was immediately admitted for further evaluation and management. Laboratory tests were ordered, including complete blood count, electrolytes, and inflammatory markers. An abdominal ultrasound was also requested to confirm the diagnosis. Intravenous fluids were initiated to address dehydration caused by vomiting.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the hospital. Surgical consultation has been arranged for possible appendectomy if the diagnosis is confirmed. The patient should expect a follow-up appointment with her primary care physician within one week post-discharge to assess recovery and discuss any necessary postoperative care.

It is essential that the patient returns promptly if symptoms worsen or persist, as delay in treatment may lead to complications such as perforation of the appendix. The patient was advised to maintain a light diet and avoid strenuous activity until fully recovered.
