Chief Complaint: Acute shortness of breath and chest pain

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 57-year-old female, presented to the emergency department with complaints of sudden onset of severe chest pain and dyspnea. The symptoms began approximately 3 hours ago while she was at home. She described the chest pain as a crushing sensation in the center of her chest that radiated to her left arm. Accompanying symptoms include profuse sweating, nausea, and lightheadedness. The patient has no known allergies and denies any recent trauma or physical exertion prior to symptom onset.

Physical Examination Findings: Vital signs upon arrival revealed a blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg, pulse rate of 120 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on room air. On auscultation, there was a systolic murmur heard best at the left lower sternal border. The patient appeared anxious and in distress.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a working diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is suspected. This includes possible ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), or unstable angina.

Plan / Treatment: The patient was immediately transferred to the cardiac catheterization laboratory for urgent coronary angiography and potential percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Intravenous aspirin, clopidogrel, heparin, nitroglycerin, and morphine were administered en route to manage symptoms and reduce myocardial damage.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the cardiac care unit post-procedure. A follow-up appointment with a cardiologist will be scheduled within one week for further management and risk factor modification recommendations. The patient is advised to continue taking prescribed medications as directed and to return immediately if any worsening symptoms occur.
