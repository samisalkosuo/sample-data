Chief Complaint: Acute Respiratory Distress and Septic Shock

History of Present Illness (HPI): A 105-year-old male presented to the emergency department with a sudden onset of shortness of breath, fever, and altered mental status. The patient reported experiencing progressive dyspnea over the past 24 hours, accompanied by chills, confusion, and a general feeling of malaise.

Physical Examination Findings: Upon arrival, the patient was visibly distressed, diaphoretic, and tachypneic with a respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute. Blood pressure was 80/50 mmHg, pulse rate was 120 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation was 88% on room air. Auscultation revealed bilateral crackles and decreased breath sounds. The abdomen was soft, non-tender, and non-distended with normal bowel sounds.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's age, acute respiratory distress, hypotension, fever, and altered mental status, a working diagnosis of sepsis with pneumonia was made. The patient is at high risk for complications due to advanced age and multiple comorbidities.

Plan / Treatment: The patient was immediately started on broad-spectrum antibiotics, intravenous fluids, and oxygen therapy. A chest X-ray was ordered to confirm the diagnosis of pneumonia. Due to the critical nature of the patient's condition, consultation with a critical care team was requested for possible intubation and mechanical ventilation.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Family members have been notified and are encouraged to visit during designated visiting hours. Regular updates on the patient's condition will be provided to the family. A follow-up appointment with the primary care physician will be scheduled upon discharge from the ICU.

It is essential that the patient receives prompt and aggressive treatment due to his advanced age and critical condition. The healthcare team will work diligently to stabilize the patient and manage any complications that may arise during this challenging time.
