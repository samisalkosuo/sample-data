Chief Complaint: Acute Respiratory Distress and Fever in a 4-year-old male

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 4-year-old male, presented with a 3-day history of high fever (up to 103Â°F), persistent cough, and labored breathing. The symptoms worsened over the past day, leading to increased respiratory distress and decreased energy levels. No known allergies or significant medical history was reported.

Physical Examination Findings: Upon examination, the patient appeared lethargic and tachypneic (rapid breathing rate). Auscultation of the chest revealed coarse crackles bilaterally, suggesting possible pneumonia. The oxygen saturation level was 92% on room air, which is below the normal range for this age group.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia (severity level 3) is suspected.

Plan / Treatment: The patient was immediately started on intravenous antibiotics to address the suspected infection. Oxygen therapy was initiated to support his breathing. A chest X-ray was ordered for further evaluation and confirmation of the diagnosis.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the hospital for at least 48 hours. Follow-up appointments will be scheduled with the pediatrician upon discharge to assess response to treatment and ensure complete resolution of symptoms. Parents are advised to return if the child's condition worsens or if fever persists beyond 3 days after starting antibiotics.

It is crucial for the patient to complete the full course of prescribed antibiotics to prevent complications and ensure recovery.
