Chief Complaint: Acute Respiratory Distress and Deteriorating General Condition

History of Present Illness (HPI): A 99-year-old male presented to the emergency department today, reporting progressive shortness of breath over the past week. The patient also reported a persistent cough producing pinkish sputum, intermittent chest pain, and decreased appetite. He has been experiencing increasing fatigue and confusion in the last two days. His family noted that he has lost approximately 10 pounds over the past month.

Physical Examination Findings: Upon examination, the patient appeared cachectic with a respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 88% on room air, and a blood pressure of 90/60 mmHg. Auscultation revealed bilateral crackles and decreased breath sounds. The patient's heart rate was irregularly fast at 125 beats per minute, and his temperature was 37.8°C (100°F).

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's advanced age, acute respiratory distress, and hemodynamic instability, a tentative diagnosis of pneumonia with possible congestive heart failure is suspected. Further diagnostic tests, including chest X-ray, blood cultures, and echocardiogram, are warranted to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential etiologies.

Plan / Treatment: The patient was immediately started on high-flow oxygen therapy, intravenous antibiotics, and a diuretic for suspected heart failure. A cardiology consultation was requested due to the irregular heart rate. The patient will also require close monitoring in the intensive care unit (ICU).

Follow-up Instructions: The patient's condition will be closely monitored in the ICU, and a follow-up with the primary care physician is recommended upon discharge from the hospital to manage ongoing medications and rehabilitation. The family has been informed of the critical nature of the patient's condition and the need for close observation.
