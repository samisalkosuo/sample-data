Chief Complaint: Acute abdominal pain and shortness of breath

History of Present Illness (HPI): A 24-year-old male presented to the emergency department with a sudden onset of severe, constant abdominal pain localized in the lower right quadrant, accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and sharp chest pain. The patient reported experiencing these symptoms for approximately 6 hours prior to arrival. He also mentioned shortness of breath and feeling lightheaded.

Physical Examination Findings: Vital signs revealed tachycardia (heart rate 120 bpm) and hypotension (blood pressure 90/50 mmHg). Abdominal examination showed localized tenderness in the right lower quadrant with guarding and rebound tenderness. Auscultation of the abdomen revealed a palpable mass, and percussion elicited a positive Murphy's sign. The patient appeared pale and diaphoretic.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the acute onset, localized abdominal pain, rebound tenderness, and positive Murphy's sign, the patient is suspected to have an appendicitis with possible perforation. The shortness of breath, tachycardia, and hypotension suggest a systemic response to the intra-abdominal infection.

Plan / Treatment: The patient was immediately admitted for intravenous fluid resuscitation, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and pain management. An urgent abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan is ordered to confirm the diagnosis and assess for any complications such as perforation or abscess formation.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the hospital's intensive care unit. A surgical consultation has been requested, and the patient should expect an appendectomy within the next 24 hours. The patient is advised to inform the healthcare team of any changes in symptoms or vital signs.

The patient will receive further instructions regarding post-operative care and follow-up appointments upon discharge from the hospital.
