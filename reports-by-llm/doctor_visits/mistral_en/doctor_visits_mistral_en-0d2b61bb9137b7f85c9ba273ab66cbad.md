Severity Level: 4 (Less-urgent)
Patient Gender: Female
Patient Age: 23

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with a persistent, non-productive cough and mild shortness of breath over the past week.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient reported that her symptoms began gradually, with a dry, hacking cough that worsened throughout the day. She also noted occasional wheezing and mild chest discomfort, particularly when taking deep breaths or exerting herself. The symptoms have not responded to over-the-counter cough suppressants and expectorants. There is no associated fever, chills, or night sweats.

Physical Examination Findings:
Upon examination, the patient appeared comfortable and was in no acute distress. Her vital signs were within normal limits, with a pulse rate of 88 beats per minute, blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. Auscultation of the chest revealed occasional wheezes in the left lower lobe. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a preliminary diagnosis of bronchitis is suspected. However, further diagnostic tests may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential causes such as pneumonia or asthma.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient was prescribed a 5-day course of a bronchodilator and an antibiotic to help alleviate her symptoms and reduce the risk of secondary bacterial infection. She was also advised to use a humidifier, drink plenty of fluids, and avoid irritants such as smoke and dust.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient is scheduled for a follow-up appointment in one week to assess her response to treatment and determine if any further testing or adjustments to the treatment plan are necessary. She was advised to seek immediate medical attention if her symptoms worsen, if she develops a fever, or if she experiences difficulty breathing.

It is important for the patient to complete the full course of antibiotics as prescribed to ensure effective resolution of her symptoms and prevent the development of antibiotic resistance. The patient was also encouraged to maintain good hygiene practices to minimize the risk of reinfection.
