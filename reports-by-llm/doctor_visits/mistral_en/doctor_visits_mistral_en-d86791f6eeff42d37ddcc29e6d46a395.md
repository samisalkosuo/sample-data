Chief Complaint: Acute shortness of breath and chest pain

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, an 82-year-old male, presented to the emergency department with a sudden onset of severe shortness of breath and sharp, persistent chest pain that radiated to his left arm. He reported experiencing these symptoms for approximately 3 hours prior to arrival. The patient also complained of profuse sweating, lightheadedness, and a feeling of anxiety. His medical history includes hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, and coronary artery disease.

Physical Examination Findings: Upon examination, the patient appeared visibly distressed with a respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, blood pressure of 160/95 mmHg, pulse rate of 110 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation of 88% on room air. Auscultation revealed bilateral crackles in the lung bases, a regular heart rhythm with a systolic murmur heard best at the left lower sternal border, and cool extremities.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's age, medical history, and acute symptoms, an urgent diagnosis of possible acute coronary syndrome (ACS) with potential pulmonary edema is suspected.

Plan / Treatment: The patient was immediately started on supplemental oxygen at 6 L/min via nasal cannula. A 12-lead ECG was obtained, revealing ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads, confirming a diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (STEMI). The patient was promptly transferred to the nearest cardiac catheterization laboratory for urgent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and potential stent placement. Intravenous aspirin, clopidogrel, heparin, and nitroglycerin were administered en route to the cath lab.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored during and following the PCI procedure. Post-procedure, the patient will be transferred to the cardiac care unit for further management and monitoring. A follow-up appointment with a cardiologist will be scheduled within one week of discharge from the hospital. The patient was advised to maintain a low-sodium diet, engage in regular exercise, and adhere to medication regimen as prescribed by his cardiologist.
