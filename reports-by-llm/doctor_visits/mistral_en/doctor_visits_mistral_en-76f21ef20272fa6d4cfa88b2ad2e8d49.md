Severity Level: 2 (Emergent)
Patient Gender: Female
Patient Age: 73

Chief Complaint:
Acute shortness of breath and chest pain

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient presented to the emergency department complaining of sudden onset of severe chest pain, radiating to the left arm, accompanied by dyspnea. The symptoms started approximately 3 hours ago while she was at home. She reports no preceding trauma or known allergies. The patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, for which she is currently on medication.

Physical Examination Findings:
Upon examination, the patient appeared anxious and in distress. Her blood pressure was 180/95 mmHg, pulse rate was 120 beats per minute, respiratory rate was 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation was 93% on room air. Auscultation of the chest revealed decreased breath sounds at the left base with a systolic murmur.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
Given the patient's symptoms, history, and physical examination findings, there is a high suspicion for an acute coronary syndrome, possibly a myocardial infarction. Further diagnostic tests are warranted to confirm this diagnosis.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient was immediately started on aspirin, nitroglycerin, and oxygen therapy. Electrocardiogram (ECG) and cardiac enzymes were ordered. If the ECG shows ST-segment elevation, the patient will be transferred to the cardiac catheterization laboratory for urgent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient will remain in the hospital for close monitoring and further management. A follow-up appointment with her primary care physician will be scheduled upon discharge, along with a referral to a cardiologist for long-term management of her heart condition. The patient was advised to continue her medications as prescribed and to return immediately if symptoms worsen or recur.
