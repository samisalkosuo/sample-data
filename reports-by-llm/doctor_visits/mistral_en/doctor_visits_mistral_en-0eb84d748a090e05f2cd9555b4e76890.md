Chief Complaint: Acute abdominal pain and shortness of breath

History of Present Illness (HPI): A 44-year-old female presented to the emergency department with a chief complaint of severe, constant abdominal pain that began suddenly over the past 6 hours. The patient also reported experiencing shortness of breath, nausea, and vomiting multiple times. She denied any trauma or recent surgery but mentioned a history of irregular menstrual cycles.

Physical Examination Findings: Upon initial assessment, the patient appeared distressed with a heart rate of 120 bpm, blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute. Abdominal examination revealed tenderness in the lower right quadrant, guarding, and rebound tenderness. Auscultation of the abdomen revealed a possible mass in the lower right quadrant.

Assessment / Diagnosis: The patient's presentation suggests an acute appendicitis with potential complications such as perforation, given the severity of symptoms and physical examination findings.

Plan / Treatment: The patient was immediately admitted for intravenous fluid resuscitation, pain management, and antibiotics to prevent further infection. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis will be ordered to confirm the diagnosis and assess for any complications. Surgical consultation has been requested for possible appendectomy.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the hospital, with follow-ups scheduled as needed with the surgical team and primary care provider. The patient should return to the emergency department if symptoms worsen or if she experiences fever, increased abdominal pain, or persistent vomiting.
