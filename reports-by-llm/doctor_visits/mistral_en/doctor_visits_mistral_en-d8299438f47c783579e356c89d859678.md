Chief Complaint: Acute shortness of breath and chest pain

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 69-year-old female, presented to the emergency department with complaints of sudden onset of severe shortness of breath and sharp, persistent chest pain that radiates to her left arm. The symptoms began approximately two hours ago while she was at home and have since worsened. She denies any associated symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, or coughing up blood. Her past medical history includes hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and a previous myocardial infarction three years ago.

Physical Examination Findings: Upon initial assessment, the patient appeared anxious and in distress. Vital signs revealed a heart rate of 130 bpm, blood pressure of 160/95 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 88% on room air, and temperature of 37.2Â°C. Auscultation of the heart revealed a regular tachycardia with an audible S4 gallop. Lung auscultation demonstrated bilateral crackles in the lower lung fields.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's history, acute onset of symptoms, and physical examination findings, it is highly suspected that she is experiencing an acute decompensation of her congestive heart failure or a possible recurrent myocardial infarction.

Plan / Treatment: The patient was immediately started on oxygen therapy via nasal cannula at 4 L/min and received intravenous morphine for pain management. A 12-lead ECG was obtained, which showed ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads, confirming a suspected acute myocardial infarction. The patient was subsequently transferred to the cardiac catheterization laboratory for urgent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored during her hospital stay and managed by the cardiology team. A follow-up appointment with her primary care provider will be scheduled upon discharge to discuss ongoing management of her congestive heart failure and diabetes mellitus, as well as risk factor modification strategies.
