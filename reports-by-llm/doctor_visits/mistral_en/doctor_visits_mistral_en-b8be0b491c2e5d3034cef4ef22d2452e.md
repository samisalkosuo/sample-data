Chief Complaint: Acute Respiratory Distress and Septic Shock

History of Present Illness (HPI): A 103-year-old female presented to the emergency department with a 24-hour history of progressive dyspnea, fever, and hypotension. The patient reported experiencing increasing shortness of breath, accompanied by coughing up pinkish sputum, and a sudden onset of high fever (103°F). She also mentioned feeling weak and lightheaded, with a drop in blood pressure leading to dizziness upon standing.

Physical Examination Findings: Upon arrival, the patient appeared lethargic and tachypneic, with a respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute. Her oxygen saturation was 88% on room air, requiring immediate supplemental oxygen. Auscultation revealed bilateral crackles in the lung bases, and her heart rate was rapid at 140 beats per minute. The patient's blood pressure was 90/60 mmHg, and she had a temperature of 103°F.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's age, acute onset of respiratory distress, fever, hypotension, and tachycardia, the working diagnosis is sepsis with probable pneumonia. The patient's condition is critical due to her advanced age and multiple symptoms, which necessitate immediate intervention.

Plan / Treatment: The patient was immediately started on broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected sepsis and oxygen therapy for respiratory support. Intravenous fluids were administered to address hypotension, and a central line was placed for easy access. A chest X-ray was ordered to confirm the diagnosis of pneumonia.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the intensive care unit (ICU) due to her critical condition. Family members have been informed and are encouraged to visit during designated visiting hours. Further diagnostic tests, such as blood cultures and lactate levels, will be performed to guide treatment and assess response to therapy. The patient's condition will be reassessed daily, and adjustments to the treatment plan will be made as necessary.
