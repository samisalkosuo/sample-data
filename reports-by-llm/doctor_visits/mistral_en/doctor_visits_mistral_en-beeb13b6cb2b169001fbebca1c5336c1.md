The patient reported the onset of intense abdominal pain approximately 6 hours ago, localized primarily in the lower right quadrant. The pain is constant, sharp, and radiates to the back. Accompanying symptoms include nausea, vomiting, and fever. The patient also reports a decreased appetite and feeling generally unwell.
