Chief Complaint:
Acute respiratory distress and fever in a 5-year-old female patient.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient was brought to the clinic by her parents, reporting a sudden onset of high fever (103°F) and labored breathing over the past 24 hours. The child has been lethargic, with decreased appetite and coughing fits that produce yellowish phlegm. She has no known allergies or chronic medical conditions.

Physical Examination Findings:
Upon examination, the patient appeared distressed, with rapid breathing (>60 breaths/min) and a respiratory rate greater than her heart rate (tachypnea). Her oxygen saturation was 92% on room air, which prompted supplemental oxygen administration. Auscultation of the lungs revealed crackles bilaterally in the lower lung fields, suggestive of pneumonia. The patient's temperature was 103°F (39.4°C), pulse rate was 140 beats/min, and blood pressure was within normal limits for her age.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
Given the acute onset of respiratory distress, fever, and pulmonary findings, the patient is suspected to have a bacterial pneumonia. The severity level indicates an urgent need for 2+ resources due to the potential life-threatening nature of the condition.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient was admitted to the pediatric ward for further evaluation and management. Intravenous antibiotics were initiated, along with oxygen therapy and fluid replacement. A chest X-ray will be performed to confirm the diagnosis and assess the extent of lung involvement.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient's parents should remain in close contact with the healthcare team regarding her progress. The child is expected to stay in the hospital for at least 48 hours, depending on her response to treatment. A follow-up appointment will be scheduled upon discharge to monitor her recovery and adjust the antibiotic regimen as necessary.

It is crucial that the patient completes the full course of antibiotics to ensure complete resolution of the infection and prevent complications. The parents should also closely monitor the child's temperature, breathing, and appetite at home. If any concerns arise or if her condition worsens, they are advised to seek immediate medical attention.
