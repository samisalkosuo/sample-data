Chief Complaint: Acute shortness of breath and chest pain

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 65-year-old male, presented to the emergency department with complaints of sudden onset of severe chest pain radiating to his left arm accompanied by profuse sweating and dyspnea. The symptoms began approximately 2 hours ago while he was at home. He denies any preceding trauma or recent exertion.

Physical Examination Findings: Upon initial assessment, the patient appeared anxious and in distress. His blood pressure was 160/95 mmHg, pulse rate was 130 beats per minute, respiratory rate was 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation was 88% on room air. Auscultation of the chest revealed decreased breath sounds and a systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's acute symptoms, history of coronary artery disease, and physical examination findings, an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is suspected. The most likely diagnosis is ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).

Plan / Treatment: The patient was immediately transferred to the cardiac catheterization laboratory for urgent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Aspirin, clopidogrel, and heparin were administered en route. Oxygen therapy was initiated to improve oxygen saturation levels.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the cardiac care unit post-procedure. A follow-up appointment with a cardiologist will be scheduled within one week for further management and risk factor modification recommendations. The patient is advised to continue taking prescribed medications as directed and to return immediately if any recurrence of symptoms occurs.

It is essential that the patient adheres to a heart-healthy lifestyle, including regular exercise, a balanced diet, smoking cessation, and stress management techniques.
