Severity Level: 4 (Less-urgent)
Patient Gender: Male
Patient Age: 84

Chief Complaint:
Acute onset of shortness of breath and chest pain

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient, an 84-year-old male, presented to the emergency department complaining of sudden onset of dyspnea and chest pain that began approximately 6 hours ago. The symptoms have been progressively worsening, with the patient reporting difficulty breathing even at rest and a constant, crushing chest pain that radiates to his left arm. He denies any associated symptoms such as cough, fever, or sweating.

Physical Examination Findings:
Upon examination, the patient appeared uncomfortable and diaphoretic. His blood pressure was 140/85 mmHg, pulse rate was 110 beats per minute, respiratory rate was 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation was 93% on room air. Auscultation of the chest revealed bilateral crackles in the lower lung fields. Cardiovascular examination showed a regular tachycardia with no murmurs or gallops.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
The patient's presentation is suggestive of congestive heart failure exacerbation. The acute onset, dyspnea, chest pain, and cardiac findings support this diagnosis.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient was started on intravenous furosemide 40mg for diuresis, nitrates for afterload reduction, and oxygen therapy to maintain saturation above 94%. A chest X-ray and electrocardiogram were ordered to further evaluate the heart function. The patient will be admitted for close monitoring and management of his symptoms.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient will be followed up closely by the cardiology team during his hospital stay. He is advised to continue with prescribed medications as directed and to report any worsening of symptoms promptly. A follow-up appointment with the cardiologist will be scheduled upon discharge from the hospital.
