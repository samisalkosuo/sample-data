Chief Complaint: Acute abdominal pain and shortness of breath

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 33-year-old male, presented to the emergency department with complaints of severe, constant abdominal pain that began abruptly 6 hours ago. The pain is localized primarily in the lower right quadrant and radiates to the back. Accompanying symptoms include nausea, vomiting, and shortness of breath. The patient reports feeling generally unwell and has been experiencing chills and fever.

Physical Examination Findings: Vital signs reveal tachycardia (heart rate 120 bpm) and mild hypotension (blood pressure 100/60 mmHg). Abdominal examination reveals localized tenderness in the lower right quadrant with guarding and rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds are diminished, and there is no palpable mass. Respiratory examination shows bilateral basilar crackles.

Assessment / Diagnosis: The patient's presentation suggests an acute abdomen, likely appendicitis complicated by pleural effusion due to the shortness of breath.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be admitted for further evaluation and management. Initial treatment includes intravenous fluids, analgesia, and antibiotics. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and chest will be ordered to confirm the diagnosis and assess for any complications. If appendicitis is confirmed, surgical intervention will be necessary.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the hospital. Follow-up appointments with the general surgeon and primary care provider will be scheduled upon discharge. The patient should return to the emergency department if symptoms worsen or persist.
