Chief Complaint: Acute abdominal pain and shortness of breath

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 42-year-old male, presented to the emergency department with complaints of severe, constant abdominal pain that started approximately 6 hours ago. He also reported experiencing shortness of breath and chest tightness over the past hour. The pain is localized primarily in the lower right quadrant of his abdomen and is accompanied by nausea and vomiting. The patient denies any trauma or recent changes to his diet or medication regimen.

Physical Examination Findings: Upon initial assessment, the patient appeared uncomfortable and was breathing rapidly. His blood pressure was 140/90 mmHg, pulse rate was 120 beats per minute, respiratory rate was 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation was 93% on room air. Abdominal examination revealed localized tenderness in the lower right quadrant with guarding and rebound tenderness. Auscultation of the abdomen revealed a possible bowel sound. The patient's lungs were clear to auscultation, but he exhibited accessory muscle use during inspiration.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, and severity level, an acute appendicitis with potential complications is suspected.

Plan / Treatment: The patient was immediately admitted to the hospital for further evaluation and management. Laboratory tests were ordered, including complete blood count (CBC), electrolytes, liver function tests (LFTs), and coagulation profile. An abdominal ultrasound was also requested to confirm the diagnosis. Intravenous fluids were initiated, and analgesics were administered for pain management.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the hospital. A surgical consultation has been arranged for possible appendectomy. The patient should expect a follow-up appointment with his primary care provider within one week after discharge to discuss recovery and any necessary postoperative care.

It is crucial that the patient returns to the emergency department immediately if symptoms worsen or new symptoms develop, such as increased abdominal pain, fever, or persistent shortness of breath.
