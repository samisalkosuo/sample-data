Chief Complaint: Acute asthmatic episode

History of Present Illness (HPI): A 10-year-old male patient presented to the emergency department with a sudden onset of shortness of breath, wheezing, and chest tightness. The symptoms began approximately two hours prior to arrival and have progressively worsened. The patient reports increased respiratory rate, difficulty speaking in full sentences due to dyspnea, and intercostal retractions. He has a history of asthma, which is currently managed with an inhaled corticosteroid and short-acting bronchodilator.

Physical Examination Findings: Upon examination, the patient appeared anxious and distressed. Vital signs revealed tachycardia (heart rate 140 bpm) and tachypnea (respiratory rate 32 breaths per minute). Auscultation of the chest revealed bilateral wheezing, particularly in the lower lung fields. Oxygen saturation was 88% on room air, which improved to 95% with supplemental oxygen at 4 L/min via nasal cannula.

Assessment / Diagnosis: The patient is experiencing an acute asthmatic exacerbation, a potentially life-threatening condition requiring immediate intervention due to severe respiratory distress and hypoxemia.

Plan / Treatment: The patient was immediately administered nebulized albuterol (2.5 mg) and ipratropium bromide (0.5 mg). Oxygen therapy was continued at 4 L/min via nasal cannula. Intravenous methylprednisolone (30 mg/kg) was initiated for steroid coverage. The patient's response to initial treatment will be closely monitored, and further adjustments in medications may be necessary.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will remain under observation in the hospital until stabilization is achieved. A follow-up appointment with the primary care provider will be scheduled within 24 hours of discharge for further asthma management adjustments and to discuss the need for a potential referral to an asthma specialist. The patient's parents have been instructed on the importance of adhering to the prescribed medication regimen, recognizing signs of worsening symptoms, and seeking prompt medical attention if necessary.
