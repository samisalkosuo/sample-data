Clinic or Hospital Location: Sund Healthcare Center

Severity Level: 2 (Emergent)
Patient Gender: Male
Patient Age: 71

Chief Complaint:
Acute shortness of breath and chest pain

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient presented to the emergency department complaining of sudden onset of severe chest pain, radiating to the left arm, accompanied by profuse sweating and dyspnea. The symptoms began approximately 2 hours ago while the patient was at home. He denies any trauma or recent physical exertion prior to the onset of symptoms.

Physical Examination Findings:
Upon initial assessment, the patient appeared anxious and in distress. Vital signs revealed a heart rate of 130 bpm, blood pressure of 160/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 88% on room air. Auscultation of the chest revealed a systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border, with bilateral crackles heard in the lung bases.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
Given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a working diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is suspected. The high likelihood of this diagnosis warrants immediate cardiac intervention due to the potential life-threatening nature of the condition.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient was immediately transferred to the cardiac catheterization laboratory for urgent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Upon arrival, he received aspirin, clopidogrel, and a nitrate spray for chest pain relief. Oxygen therapy was initiated to improve oxygen saturation levels.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient will be closely monitored in the cardiac care unit post-procedure. A follow-up appointment with his primary care physician will be scheduled within one week to discuss medication management and lifestyle modifications. The patient is advised to avoid strenuous activities and to seek immediate medical attention if symptoms recur or worsen.

It is essential that the patient adheres to the prescribed medications and lifestyle changes to minimize the risk of future cardiac events.
