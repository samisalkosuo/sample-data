Chief Complaint: Acute shortness of breath and chest pain

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 73-year-old male, presented to the emergency department with complaints of sudden onset of severe chest pain radiating to his left arm accompanied by profuse sweating. He also reported experiencing acute shortness of breath and feeling lightheaded. The symptoms began approximately two hours ago while at rest.

Physical Examination Findings: Upon initial assessment, the patient appeared anxious and in distress. Vital signs revealed a heart rate of 130 bpm, blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on room air. Auscultation of the chest revealed diminished breath sounds in the left lung base with a systolic murmur heard at the apex.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's age, acute symptoms, and physical examination findings, the working diagnosis is suspected acute coronary syndrome (ACS), likely a myocardial infarction (MI).

Plan / Treatment: The patient was immediately started on aspirin, nitroglycerin, and morphine for pain relief. Oxygen therapy was initiated to improve oxygen saturation levels. An electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed, which showed ST-segment elevation in the leads corresponding to the area of chest pain. The patient was subsequently transferred to the cardiac catheterization laboratory for urgent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored during and after the PCI procedure. He is expected to remain hospitalized for several days for further management and monitoring of his condition. A follow-up appointment with a cardiologist will be scheduled upon discharge from the hospital.

It is essential that the patient adheres to all medication regimens, lifestyle modifications, and rehabilitation recommendations provided by the healthcare team to minimize the risk of recurrent events. The patient should also return for routine follow-up appointments as scheduled.
