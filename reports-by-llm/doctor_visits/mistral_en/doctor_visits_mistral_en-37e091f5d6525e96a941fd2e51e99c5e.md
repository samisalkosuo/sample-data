Chief Complaint: Acute shortness of breath and chest pain

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, an 87-year-old male, presented to the emergency department with a sudden onset of severe shortness of breath and sharp, persistent chest pain that radiated to his left arm. He reported experiencing these symptoms for approximately 2 hours prior to arrival. The patient also complained of profuse sweating, lightheadedness, and a feeling of anxiety. He has a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease.

Physical Examination Findings: Upon examination, the patient appeared visibly distressed with a respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, blood pressure of 160/95 mmHg, pulse rate of 110 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation of 88% on room air. Auscultation revealed bilateral crackles in the lung bases, a regular heart rhythm with a systolic murmur heard best at the left lower sternal border, and cool extremities.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's age, medical history, and acute symptoms, there is a high suspicion of an acute coronary syndrome (ACS), most likely an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The patient requires immediate intervention due to the potential for life-threatening complications.

Plan / Treatment: The patient was promptly administered aspirin, nitroglycerin, and oxygen therapy. An electrocardiogram (ECG) confirmed ST-segment elevation in leads V1-V4, supporting the diagnosis of STEMI. The patient was then transferred to the cardiac catheterization laboratory for urgent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

Follow-up Instructions: After successful PCI and stabilization, the patient will be admitted to the cardiac care unit for close monitoring and management of complications. A follow-up appointment with a cardiologist will be scheduled within one week post-discharge to assess treatment response and adjust medications as necessary. The patient was also advised to attend cardiac rehabilitation sessions regularly.

It is crucial that the patient's family members or caregivers remain vigilant for any signs of recurrent symptoms and seek immediate medical attention if they occur. Education on medication management, dietary modifications, and lifestyle changes will be provided during hospitalization and at follow-up appointments to optimize the patient's long-term prognosis.
