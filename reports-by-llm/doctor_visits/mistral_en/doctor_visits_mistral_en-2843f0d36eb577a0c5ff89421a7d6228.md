Chief Complaint: Acute shortness of breath and chest pain

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 81-year-old female, presented to the emergency department with complaints of sudden onset of severe shortness of breath and sharp, persistent chest pain that radiated to her left arm. She reported experiencing these symptoms for approximately 2 hours prior to arrival. The patient also mentioned feeling lightheaded and profusely sweating. She has a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease.

Physical Examination Findings: Upon examination, the patient appeared anxious and in distress. Her blood pressure was 180/95 mmHg, pulse rate was 120 beats per minute, respiratory rate was 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation was 93% on room air. Auscultation of the heart revealed a regular tachycardia with an audible S4 gallop. Lung auscultation revealed decreased breath sounds and crackles in the left lower lung field.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's symptoms, history, and physical examination findings, it is highly suspected that she is experiencing an acute coronary syndrome, likely a myocardial infarction (MI). The presence of chest pain radiating to the arm, shortness of breath, tachycardia, and S4 gallop are all indicative of this condition.

Plan / Treatment: The patient was immediately started on aspirin, nitroglycerin, and morphine for pain relief and to reduce myocardial oxygen demand. Oxygen therapy was initiated to improve her oxygen saturation levels. An electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed, which showed ST-segment elevation in the leads corresponding to the patient's symptoms, further supporting the diagnosis of an MI. The patient was subsequently transferred to the cardiac catheterization laboratory for urgent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored during her stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) and will undergo further diagnostic tests as needed. She is expected to have a prolonged hospital stay due to her age and comorbidities. Upon discharge, she will require close follow-up with her cardiologist for medication management and rehabilitation. Lifestyle modifications such as dietary changes, exercise, and smoking cessation will also be emphasized.
