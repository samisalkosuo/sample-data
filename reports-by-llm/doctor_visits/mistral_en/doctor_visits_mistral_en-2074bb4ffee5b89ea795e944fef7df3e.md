 Visit Date: 21.01.2024
Clinic or Hospital Location: Imatra General Hospital

Severity Level: 4 (Less-urgent)
Patient Gender: Male
Patient Age: 29

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with a persistent, sharp chest pain that radiates to the left arm, accompanied by shortness of breath and cold sweats.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient reported experiencing the symptoms intermittently over the past 24 hours, with increasing frequency and intensity in the last few hours. He denies any trauma or known allergies. The pain is aggravated by deep breathing and alleviated slightly by leaning forward. He has no history of similar episodes but mentions a family history of coronary artery disease.

Physical Examination Findings:
Upon examination, the patient appears anxious but coherent. Vital signs reveal a pulse rate of 105 bpm, blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on room air. Cardiovascular examination reveals a regular tachycardia with a systolic murmur heard best at the left lower sternal border. Lung auscultation reveals decreased breath sounds in the left base.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
Given the patient's symptoms, family history, and physical findings, a provisional diagnosis of possible acute coronary syndrome is suspected. However, further diagnostic tests are necessary to confirm this.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient will be admitted for electrocardiogram (ECG), cardiac enzymes, and stress testing. If the results support the diagnosis, he may require coronary angiography and potential percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The patient will also receive aspirin, nitroglycerin, and a beta-blocker for symptomatic relief and to reduce myocardial oxygen demand.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient will be followed up closely by the cardiology team. He is advised to return for further tests as scheduled and to contact the clinic if symptoms worsen or recur. Lifestyle modifications, such as dietary changes and regular exercise, will also be discussed upon discharge.
