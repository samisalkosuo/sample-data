Chief Complaint: Acute shortness of breath and chest pain

History of Present Illness (HPI): A 90-year-old female presented to the emergency department complaining of sudden onset of severe shortness of breath, accompanied by sharp chest pain that radiates to her left arm. The symptoms began approximately 3 hours ago and have progressively worsened. She reports feeling lightheaded and experiencing profuse sweating. The patient has a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease.

Physical Examination Findings: Upon examination, the patient appears distressed with a respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, blood pressure of 160/90 mmHg, pulse rate of 130 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation of 88% on room air. Auscultation reveals bilateral crackles in the lung bases, a regular heart rhythm with a systolic murmur heard best at the left lower sternal border, and cool extremities.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's age, medical history, and acute presentation of symptoms, there is a high suspicion for an acute coronary syndrome, such as an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The presence of chest pain radiating to the left arm, shortness of breath, and physical examination findings support this diagnosis.

Plan / Treatment: The patient was immediately transferred to the cardiac catheterization laboratory for emergent coronary angiography and potential percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Intravenous aspirin, heparin, nitroglycerin, and morphine were administered en route to manage symptoms and reduce myocardial damage.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the cardiac care unit post-procedure. A follow-up appointment with her primary care physician will be scheduled within one week for further management and optimization of comorbidities. The patient was advised to maintain a low-sodium, heart-healthy diet, engage in regular exercise, and adhere to her medication regimen as prescribed by her healthcare team.
