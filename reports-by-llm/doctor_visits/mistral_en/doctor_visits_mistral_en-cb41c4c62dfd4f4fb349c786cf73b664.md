Chief Complaint: Acute abdominal pain and vomiting

History of Present Illness (HPI): A 12-year-old female presented to the emergency department with a 6-hour history of intermittent, severe abdominal pain localized primarily in the lower right quadrant. The pain is sharp in nature and associated with frequent vomiting, nausea, and loss of appetite. She denies any history of trauma or recent travel.

Physical Examination Findings: Vital signs reveal a heart rate of 120 beats per minute, blood pressure of 90/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and temperature of 37.5°C (99.5°F). On abdominal examination, there is localized tenderness in the lower right quadrant with guarding and rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds are hypoactive.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the acute onset of severe lower abdominal pain, associated vomiting, and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of appendicitis is suspected. The patient's vital signs suggest mild compensated shock due to possible peritoneal irritation.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be admitted for further evaluation and management. Initial treatment includes intravenous fluid resuscitation, pain management, and antibiotics to cover common appendicular pathogens. A surgical consultation has been requested for potential appendectomy.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the hospital. A follow-up appointment with the surgeon will be scheduled post-operatively to discuss the surgical findings and post-operative care instructions.
