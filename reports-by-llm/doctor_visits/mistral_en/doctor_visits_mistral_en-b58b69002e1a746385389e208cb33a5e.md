Chief Complaint:
Acute abdominal pain and vomiting

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient, a 11-year-old female, presented to the emergency department with complaints of severe, continuous abdominal pain that started approximately 6 hours ago. The pain is localized primarily in the lower right quadrant of her abdomen and is accompanied by frequent vomiting. She reports no history of trauma or injury. The patient appears uncomfortable and has a fever of 38.5°C (101.3°F).

Physical Examination Findings:
Upon examination, the patient's abdomen is tender to palpation in the lower right quadrant, with guarding and rebound tenderness noted. Bowel sounds are hypoactive. No signs of peritonitis were observed. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
The patient's symptoms and physical findings suggest an acute appendicitis, a potentially life-threatening condition requiring immediate medical attention.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient will be admitted for further evaluation and management. Laboratory tests including complete blood count (CBC), electrolytes, and inflammatory markers will be ordered. An abdominal ultrasound or CT scan may also be performed to confirm the diagnosis. The treatment of choice is appendectomy, a surgical procedure to remove the affected appendix.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient will be closely monitored in the hospital. A follow-up appointment with the surgeon will be scheduled for postoperative care and recovery instructions. The patient's parents have been informed of the situation and are present during the evaluation.
