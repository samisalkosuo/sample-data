Chief Complaint: Acute shortness of breath and chest pain

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, an 81-year-old male, presented to the emergency department with a sudden onset of severe shortness of breath and sharp, persistent chest pain that radiated to his left arm. He reported experiencing these symptoms while climbing stairs at home earlier today. The pain worsened over the past hour, accompanied by profuse sweating and lightheadedness. He has no known allergies and denies any recent illnesses or injuries.

Physical Examination Findings: Upon examination, the patient appeared anxious and in distress. His blood pressure was 160/95 mmHg, pulse rate was 120 beats per minute, respiratory rate was 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation was 88% on room air. Auscultation of the chest revealed decreased breath sounds and a systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's age, acute symptoms, and physical examination findings, there is a high suspicion for an acute coronary syndrome, such as a myocardial infarction (heart attack).

Plan / Treatment: The patient was immediately started on oxygen therapy and administered sublingual nitroglycerin. An electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed, which showed ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads, confirming a diagnosis of an acute anterior wall myocardial infarction. The patient was transferred to the cardiac catheterization laboratory for urgent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the cardiac care unit post-procedure. A follow-up appointment with a cardiologist will be scheduled within one week to discuss further management and medications, including antiplatelet therapy and cholesterol-lowering drugs.

Rehabilitation services, such as physical therapy and cardiac rehab, will also be recommended to aid in recovery and prevent future complications. The patient should avoid strenuous activities until cleared by his healthcare provider.
