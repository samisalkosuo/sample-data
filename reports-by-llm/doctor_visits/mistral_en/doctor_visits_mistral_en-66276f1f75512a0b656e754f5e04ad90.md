Chief Complaint: Acute abdominal pain and shortness of breath

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 45-year-old female, presented to the emergency department with a sudden onset of severe abdominal pain localized primarily in the lower right quadrant, accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and shortness of breath. The symptoms began approximately 6 hours ago and have since worsened. She denies any trauma or recent surgery.

Physical Examination Findings: Vital signs revealed a heart rate of 120 bpm, blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on room air. Abdominal examination revealed localized tenderness in the lower right quadrant with guarding and rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds were hypoactive.

Assessment / Diagnosis: The patient's presentation is concerning for an acute appendicitis, a less-urgent condition (Severity 4) that requires prompt attention due to the potential for complications.

Plan / Treatment: The patient was admitted to the hospital for further evaluation and management. Initial treatment includes intravenous fluids, pain medication, and antibiotics. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen will be ordered to confirm the diagnosis and assess for any complications. Surgical consultation has been requested due to the severity of symptoms.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the hospital. Surgery may be scheduled as soon as possible, depending on the results of the CT scan. Postoperative follow-up will be arranged with the surgeon and primary care provider. The patient is advised to continue taking prescribed medications as directed and to seek immediate attention if symptoms worsen or new symptoms develop.
