The patient reported that his symptoms began gradually, with a dry, non-productive cough that worsened over time. He also noted increasing shortness of breath, particularly upon exertion. The patient denied any chest pain, fever, or hemoptysis. He has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and hypertension, for which he is currently on medication.

Auscultation of the chest revealed decreased breath sounds and prolonged expiration bilaterally, consistent with COPD exacerbation.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
Based on the patient's history and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of COPD exacerbation is suspected.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient was started on nebulized bronchodilators and systemic corticosteroids for symptomatic relief and to reduce inflammation in the airways.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient is scheduled for a follow-up appointment in one week to assess his response to treatment and adjust the medication regimen as needed. He was also advised to monitor his symptoms closely and seek immediate attention if they worsen or if he develops any new symptoms such as chest pain, fever, or hemoptysis. The patient was educated on COPD management strategies, including breathing exercises, pulmonary rehabilitation, and smoking cessation.
