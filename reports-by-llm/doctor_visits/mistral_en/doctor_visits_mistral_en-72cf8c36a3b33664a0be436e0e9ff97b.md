Clinic or Hospital Location: Nakkila Health Center

Severity Level: 4 (Less-urgent)
Patient Gender: Male
Patient Age: 23

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with a persistent, non-productive cough and intermittent chest discomfort for the past week.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient reported that the symptoms started gradually, with a dry, hacking cough that worsened over the course of a week. He also described a sensation of tightness in his chest, which was exacerbated by deep breathing or physical exertion. The patient denied any associated fever, chills, shortness of breath, or hemoptysis (coughing up blood). He has not sought medical attention previously and has not been hospitalized for this condition.

Physical Examination Findings:
Upon examination, the patient appeared comfortable, with a normal vital sign profile. His respiratory rate was slightly elevated at 20 breaths per minute, and auscultation of his chest revealed occasional coarse crackles in the left lower lung field. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a preliminary diagnosis of bronchitis is suspected. However, further diagnostic tests such as a chest X-ray or pulmonary function tests may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential causes of the patient's symptoms.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient was prescribed a course of antibiotics (amoxicillin 500mg twice daily for 7 days) to address any possible bacterial infection, as well as an expectorant (guaifenesin 600mg three times daily) to help loosen and expel mucus from the lungs. The patient was also advised to rest, stay hydrated, and avoid smoking or exposure to secondhand smoke.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient is scheduled for a follow-up appointment in one week to assess his response to treatment and determine if any additional tests are necessary. He was instructed to return immediately if his symptoms worsen or if he develops fever, shortness of breath, or hemoptysis. The patient was also provided with educational materials on managing bronchitis at home.
