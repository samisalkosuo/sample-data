Chief Complaint: Acute shortness of breath and chest pain

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 61-year-old male, presented to the emergency department with complaints of sudden onset of severe chest pain radiating to his left arm accompanied by profuse sweating and dyspnea. The symptoms started approximately 2 hours ago while he was at home. He denies any trauma or recent exertion prior to the onset of symptoms.

Physical Examination Findings: Upon examination, the patient appeared anxious and in distress. His blood pressure was 160/95 mmHg, pulse rate was 120 beats per minute, respiratory rate was 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation was 88% on room air. Auscultation of the heart revealed a regular tachycardia with an audible S4 gallop. Lung auscultation revealed bilateral crackles in the lower lung fields.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, and age, the working diagnosis is acute coronary syndrome (ACS), likely a myocardial infarction (MI). The presence of an S4 gallop and bilateral crackles in the lungs suggest congestive heart failure as a potential complication.

Plan / Treatment: The patient was immediately started on aspirin, nitroglycerin, and morphine for pain relief and to reduce myocardial oxygen demand. Oxygen therapy was initiated to improve oxygen saturation. An electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed which showed ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads, confirming the diagnosis of ST-elevation MI. The patient was subsequently transferred to the cardiac catheterization laboratory for urgent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the cardiac care unit post-procedure. A follow-up appointment with a cardiologist will be scheduled within one week for further management and optimization of medications. The patient is advised to maintain a low-sodium diet, engage in regular exercise, and avoid smoking or excessive alcohol consumption. He should also take his prescribed medications as directed by the cardiologist.

The patient was informed about the importance of follow-up appointments and the need for prompt medical attention if any symptoms recur. He was provided with a written discharge summary detailing his diagnosis, treatment plan, and follow-up instructions.
