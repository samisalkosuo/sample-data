Clinic or Hospital Location: Raisio Health Center

Severity Level: 2 (Emergent)
Patient Gender: Male
Patient Age: 12 years old

Chief Complaint:
Acute abdominal pain and vomiting

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient presented with a sudden onset of severe, localized abdominal pain that began approximately 6 hours ago. The pain is constant, sharp, and radiates to the lower back. Accompanying symptoms include repeated episodes of non-bloody vomiting and decreased appetite. The patient reports no history of trauma or injury.

Physical Examination Findings:
Upon examination, the patient appears uncomfortable but alert. Vital signs reveal a heart rate of 120 bpm, blood pressure of 110/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and temperature of 38°C (100.4°F). Abdominal examination reveals tenderness in the lower right quadrant with guarding and rebound tenderness. No signs of peritonitis were observed.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
The patient's symptoms, physical findings, and age suggest an acute appendicitis. This is a potential life-threatening condition due to the risk of appendiceal rupture and subsequent peritonitis.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient will be admitted for further evaluation and management. Initial treatment includes intravenous fluids, pain medication, and antibiotics to prevent complications. A diagnostic imaging study (ultrasound or CT scan) will be performed to confirm the diagnosis and assess for any signs of perforation. If appendicitis is confirmed, surgical removal of the appendix (appendectomy) will be necessary.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient will be closely monitored in the hospital. A follow-up appointment with the surgeon will be scheduled after discharge to discuss the surgical plan and postoperative care instructions. The patient should return for a follow-up visit within 1 week to ensure proper healing and recovery.
