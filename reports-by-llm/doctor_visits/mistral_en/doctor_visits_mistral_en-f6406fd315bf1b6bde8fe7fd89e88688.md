Chief Complaint: Acute abdominal pain and shortness of breath

History of Present Illness (HPI): A 33-year-old male presented to the emergency department with a 6-hour history of severe, constant abdominal pain localized to the lower right quadrant, accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and worsening shortness of breath. The patient reported no preceding trauma or recent changes in diet.

Physical Examination Findings: Vital signs revealed tachycardia (120 bpm) and hypotension (90/60 mmHg). Abdominal examination elicited localized tenderness, guarding, and rebound tenderness in the lower right quadrant. Auscultation of the abdomen revealed a positive Murphy's sign. Respiratory examination demonstrated bilateral basilar crackles and decreased breath sounds on the right side.

Assessment / Diagnosis: The patient's presentation is consistent with an acute appendicitis complicated by pleural effusion, likely due to a ruptured appendix. This constitutes a level 3 severity, requiring urgent attention and multiple resources.

Plan / Treatment: The patient was immediately admitted for intravenous fluid resuscitation, broad-spectrum antibiotics (e.g., piperacillin/tazobactam), and analgesia. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and chest with contrast was ordered to confirm the diagnosis and assess for any complications. Surgical consultation was requested for possible appendectomy and drainage of pleural effusion.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the intensive care unit (ICU) postoperatively. A follow-up appointment with the general surgeon will be scheduled within 1 week to assess wound healing and discuss any necessary postoperative care. The patient was advised to contact the hospital if symptoms worsen or fever develops before the scheduled follow-up appointment.
