Chief Complaint: Acute abdominal pain and vomiting

History of Present Illness (HPI): A 10-year-old female patient presented to the emergency department with a 6-hour history of severe, continuous abdominal pain localized primarily in the lower right quadrant. The pain is described as sharp and radiating to the groin area. Accompanied by repeated vomiting, the patient appears uncomfortable and pale. No preceding trauma or known allergies were reported.

Physical Examination Findings: Vital signs reveal a heart rate of 120 bpm, blood pressure of 90/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and temperature of 37.5°C (99.5°F). Abdominal examination reveals localized tenderness and guarding in the lower right quadrant with rebound tenderness on palpation. Bowel sounds are hypoactive.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, and age, a possible appendicitis is suspected. The severity level indicates an urgent situation requiring prompt medical attention due to potential life-threatening complications.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be admitted for further evaluation and management. Laboratory tests including complete blood count (CBC), electrolytes, and inflammatory markers will be ordered. An abdominal ultrasound is planned to confirm the diagnosis of appendicitis. If confirmed, the patient may require surgical intervention for appendectomy.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the hospital. A follow-up appointment with a pediatric surgeon will be scheduled upon discharge from the hospital to discuss further management and recovery plan. It is essential that the patient returns for follow-up as scheduled to ensure proper healing and prevent complications.
