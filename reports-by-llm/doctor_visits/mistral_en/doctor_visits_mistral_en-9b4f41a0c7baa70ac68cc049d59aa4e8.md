Chief Complaint: Acute asthmatic episode with severe respiratory distress

History of Present Illness (HPI): A 9-year-old female presented to the emergency department in acute distress, reporting progressive shortness of breath and wheezing over the past few hours. The symptoms were accompanied by a persistent cough, chest tightness, and intercostal retractions. She has a history of asthma, but this episode appears more severe than usual.

Physical Examination Findings: Upon examination, the patient was visibly anxious and tachypneic with an oxygen saturation level of 88%. Auscultation revealed bilateral wheezing and decreased breath sounds. Her pulse was rapid at 140 bpm, and her respiratory rate was 32 breaths per minute.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's history of asthma, the current presentation suggests an acute exacerbation with severe bronchospasm. The patient is experiencing a level 2 emergency due to potential life threat.

Plan / Treatment: Immediate administration of nebulized bronchodilators (albuterol and ipratropium) was initiated, along with high-flow oxygen therapy. The patient was also given systemic corticosteroids (prednisone) for inflammation reduction. A close monitoring of her vital signs, oxygen saturation levels, and respiratory status is essential.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be admitted to the pediatric ward for further management and observation. A follow-up appointment with her primary care provider will be scheduled within a week post-discharge to assess the response to treatment and adjust medication regimen as necessary. It is crucial that the patient's parents closely monitor her symptoms and seek immediate medical attention if any worsening occurs.
