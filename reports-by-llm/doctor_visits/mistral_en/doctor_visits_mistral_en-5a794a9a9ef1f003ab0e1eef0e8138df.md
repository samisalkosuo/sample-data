Chief Complaint: Acute abdominal pain and shortness of breath

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 39-year-old female, presented to the emergency department with complaints of severe, constant abdominal pain that started suddenly approximately 6 hours ago. The pain is localized in the lower right quadrant of her abdomen and radiates to her back. Accompanying symptoms include nausea, vomiting, and shortness of breath. She reports feeling lightheaded and experiencing a fever with chills.

Physical Examination Findings: Vital signs upon arrival revealed a temperature of 38.5°C (101.3°F), blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg, heart rate of 120 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on room air. Abdominal examination revealed localized tenderness in the lower right quadrant with guarding and rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds were hypoactive.

Assessment / Diagnosis: The patient's presentation suggests an acute abdomen, likely appendicitis given the location of pain, fever, and leukocytosis (white blood cell count of 15,000 cells/mm3). The shortness of breath may be due to a respiratory complication such as pleurisy or pneumonia.

Plan / Treatment: The patient was immediately admitted for intravenous fluid resuscitation and pain management. Laboratory tests were ordered, including complete blood count (CBC), electrolytes, liver function tests, and coagulation profile. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast was performed to further evaluate the abdominal findings. Antibiotics were initiated for possible appendicitis and respiratory support was provided as needed.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the hospital. Surgical consultation has been requested, and the decision for appendectomy will be made based on the results of the CT scan and clinical response to treatment. The patient is advised to continue taking prescribed medications as directed and to report any worsening symptoms or fever. A follow-up appointment with her primary care provider will be scheduled upon discharge from the hospital.
