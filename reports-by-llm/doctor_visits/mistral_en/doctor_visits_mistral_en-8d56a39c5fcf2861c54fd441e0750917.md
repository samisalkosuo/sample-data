Chief Complaint: Acute Respiratory Distress and Septic Shock

History of Present Illness (HPI): A 104-year-old male presented to the emergency department with a sudden onset of shortness of breath, fever, and altered mental status. The patient reported experiencing progressive dyspnea over the past 24 hours, accompanied by chills, confusion, and decreased urine output. He also mentioned having a persistent cough producing greenish sputum.

Physical Examination Findings: Upon arrival, the patient appeared lethargic and tachypneic (respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute). His blood pressure was 90/60 mmHg, pulse rate was 120 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation was 88% on room air. Auscultation revealed bilateral crackles in the lung bases, a weak and irregular heartbeat, and a rapid, thready peripheral pulse.

Assessment / Diagnosis: The patient's presentation is consistent with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to septic shock, likely due to a systemic infection.

Plan / Treatment: The patient was immediately intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. Intravenous fluids were administered for volume resuscitation, and broad-spectrum antibiotics were initiated to cover potential bacterial infections. A chest X-ray was ordered to confirm the diagnosis of ARDS and to assess the extent of lung involvement.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the intensive care unit (ICU). A multidisciplinary team, including pulmonologists, critical care specialists, and infectious disease experts, will manage his care. The family has been informed of the patient's critical condition and the need for ongoing supportive care. Further updates will be provided as the situation evolves.
