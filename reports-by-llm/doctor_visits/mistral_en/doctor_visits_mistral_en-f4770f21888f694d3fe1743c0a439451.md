Chief Complaint: Acute abdominal pain and shortness of breath

History of Present Illness (HPI): A 52-year-old female presented to the emergency department with a two-day history of progressively worsening abdominal pain localized to the lower quadrant, accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and decreased appetite. The patient also reported sudden onset of dyspnea and orthopnea over the past few hours. She denied any chest pain, fever, or chills. Her medical history is significant for hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus, both well-controlled with medications.

Physical Examination Findings: Vital signs revealed a blood pressure of 160/95 mmHg, pulse rate of 110 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on room air. The patient appeared uncomfortable and diaphoretic. Abdominal examination revealed tenderness in the lower right quadrant with guarding and rebound tenderness. Auscultation of the abdomen revealed a hypoactive bowel sound. Pulmonary examination demonstrated bilateral basilar crackles.

Assessment / Diagnosis: The patient's presentation is concerning for an acute appendicitis complicated by pleural effusion secondary to congestive heart failure exacerbation due to poor control of hypertension and diabetes mellitus.

Plan / Treatment: The patient was immediately admitted to the hospital for intravenous fluid resuscitation, pain management, and antibiotic therapy for appendicitis. She was also started on diuretics and vasodilators to manage her congestive heart failure exacerbation. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and chest was ordered to confirm the diagnosis and assess the extent of pleural effusion.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the hospital for improvement in symptoms and resolution of pleural effusion. She will have follow-up appointments with her primary care physician and cardiologist to optimize management of her hypertension and diabetes mellitus. A surgical consultation will also be arranged for possible appendectomy once her condition stabilizes.
