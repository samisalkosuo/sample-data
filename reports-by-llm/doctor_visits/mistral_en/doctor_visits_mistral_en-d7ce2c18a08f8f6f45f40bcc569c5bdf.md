Chief Complaint: Acute shortness of breath and chest pain

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, an 87-year-old female, presented to the emergency department complaining of sudden onset of severe shortness of breath and sharp, persistent chest pain that radiated to her left arm. She reported experiencing these symptoms for approximately 2 hours prior to arrival. The patient also mentioned a history of hypertension and coronary artery disease.

Physical Examination Findings: Upon examination, the patient appeared anxious and was breathing rapidly with an oxygen saturation level of 88%. Her blood pressure was 160/95 mmHg, pulse rate was 120 beats per minute, and respiratory rate was 24 breaths per minute. Auscultation revealed a systolic murmur in the left lower sternal border, and her lungs exhibited bilateral crackles.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's age, medical history, and acute symptoms, an urgent diagnosis of possible acute coronary syndrome (ACS) was considered. A 12-lead ECG was performed to assess for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).

Plan / Treatment: The patient was immediately administered aspirin and sublingual nitroglycerin for symptomatic relief. Oxygen therapy was initiated, and a 12-lead ECG showed ST-segment elevation in leads V4-V6, confirming the diagnosis of STEMI. The patient was subsequently transferred to the cardiac catheterization laboratory for urgent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored during and following the PCI procedure. She is expected to remain in the hospital for several days for observation and management of any complications. A follow-up appointment with her cardiologist will be scheduled upon discharge, along with recommendations for lifestyle modifications, medications, and rehabilitation.

It is essential that the patient adheres to all prescribed treatments and follows up as directed to minimize the risk of further cardiac events.
