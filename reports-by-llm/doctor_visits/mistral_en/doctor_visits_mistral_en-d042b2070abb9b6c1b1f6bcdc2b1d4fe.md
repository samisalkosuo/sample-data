Chief Complaint: Acute abdominal pain and vomiting

History of Present Illness (HPI): A 21-year-old female presented to the emergency department with a 6-hour history of severe, constant, and localized lower abdominal pain that radiated to her back. The pain was accompanied by repeated episodes of non-bloody vomiting. She reported no relief with over-the-counter pain medication and denied any trauma or recent surgery.

Physical Examination Findings: Vital signs revealed tachycardia (heart rate 120 bpm) and mild hypotension (blood pressure 90/60 mmHg). Abdominal examination elicited tenderness in the lower left quadrant with guarding and rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds were hypoactive, and there was no distention.

Assessment / Diagnosis: The patient's presentation suggests an acute appendicitis based on the localized abdominal pain, rebound tenderness, and guarding. The tachycardia and hypotension may indicate a more severe case due to potential perforation.

Plan / Treatment: The patient was immediately admitted for intravenous fluid resuscitation and broad-spectrum antibiotics. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis with oral and intravenous contrast was ordered to confirm the diagnosis and assess for any complications such as perforation or abscess formation.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the hospital, and a surgical consultation has been requested. The patient should expect a possible appendectomy within 24 hours of admission. She is advised to inform her healthcare team if her symptoms worsen or if she develops fever, increased abdominal pain, or new onset of vomiting.

The patient will be discharged with postoperative instructions and a follow-up appointment with her primary care provider within one week for wound check and pain management.
