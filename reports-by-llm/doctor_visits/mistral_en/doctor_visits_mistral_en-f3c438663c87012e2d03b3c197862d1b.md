Chief Complaint: Acute abdominal pain and vomiting

History of Present Illness (HPI): A 35-year-old female presented to the emergency department with a two-day history of progressive, severe abdominal pain localized primarily in the lower right quadrant. The pain is constant and associated with frequent episodes of non-bloody vomiting. She also reports a low-grade fever (38°C) and decreased appetite.

Physical Examination Findings: On examination, the patient appears uncomfortable but alert. Abdominal examination reveals localized tenderness in the lower right quadrant with guarding and rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds are hypoactive. No signs of peritonitis were observed.

Assessment / Diagnosis: The presentation suggests an acute appendicitis, a potential life threat (Severity Level 2). The patient requires prompt surgical intervention to prevent complications such as perforation and peritonitis.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be admitted for further evaluation and management. Intravenous fluids will be initiated to correct dehydration, and antibiotics will be administered to prevent infection. Surgical consultation has been requested for possible appendectomy.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the hospital. A surgical procedure is planned for tomorrow morning. Postoperative instructions will be provided upon discharge. The patient should return for a follow-up appointment within one week to assess healing and recovery progress.
