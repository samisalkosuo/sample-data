Clinic or Hospital Location: Orivesi Health Center

Severity Level: 2 (Emergent)
Patient Gender: Female
Patient Age: 78

Chief Complaint:
Acute shortness of breath and chest pain

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient, a 78-year-old female, presented to the emergency department with complaints of sudden onset of severe chest pain radiating to her left arm, accompanied by dyspnea. The symptoms began approximately 3 hours ago while she was at home and have since worsened. She denies any preceding trauma or exertional activity.

Physical Examination Findings:
Upon initial assessment, the patient appeared anxious and in distress. Her blood pressure was 160/95 mmHg, pulse rate was 120 beats per minute, respiratory rate was 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation was 88% on room air. Auscultation of the chest revealed bilateral crackles and a systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are suggestive of an acute coronary syndrome, likely a myocardial infarction (MI). Given her age and presentation, she is at high risk for complications.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient was immediately started on aspirin, nitroglycerin, and morphine for pain relief and to reduce myocardial oxygen demand. Oxygen therapy was initiated to improve her oxygen saturation levels. An electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed, which showed ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads, confirming the diagnosis of an ST-elevation MI. The patient was subsequently transferred to the cardiac catheterization laboratory for urgent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient will be closely monitored during her hospital stay and managed by the cardiology team. She is expected to undergo PCI within the next few hours. Post-procedure, she will be transferred to the cardiac care unit for further management and monitoring. The patient's family has been informed of the situation and will be kept updated on her progress. A follow-up appointment with the cardiologist will be scheduled upon discharge from the hospital.

It is crucial that the patient adheres to her medication regimen and lifestyle modifications as prescribed by her healthcare team to reduce the risk of recurrent events.
