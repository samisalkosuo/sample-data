Chief Complaint: Acute chest pain and shortness of breath

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 59-year-old male, presented to the emergency department with complaints of severe chest pain that started approximately 3 hours ago. He described the pain as a crushing sensation in the center of his chest, radiating to his left arm and jaw. Accompanying symptoms include profuse sweating, nausea, and shortness of breath. The patient reports no preceding trauma or known allergies.

Physical Examination Findings: Vital signs revealed a heart rate of 120 beats per minute, blood pressure of 160/95 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on room air. On auscultation, there was an audible S4 gallop and crackles heard in the left lower lung field. The patient appeared anxious but coherent.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's age, symptoms, and physical examination findings, a working diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) with possible ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is suspected.

Plan / Treatment: The patient was immediately transferred to the cardiac catheterization laboratory for urgent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Aspirin, clopidogrel, and morphine were administered intravenously in the emergency department to alleviate symptoms and reduce myocardial damage. Oxygen therapy was initiated to improve oxygen saturation levels.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored post-procedure in the cardiac care unit (CCU). A follow-up appointment with a cardiologist will be scheduled within one week for further evaluation and management of risk factors. The patient was advised to maintain a low-sodium, low-fat diet, engage in regular exercise, and avoid smoking. He was also provided with prescriptions for aspirin, clopidogrel, and a statin medication.

The patient was informed about the importance of follow-up care and adherence to lifestyle modifications to reduce the risk of recurrent cardiac events.
