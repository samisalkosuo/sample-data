Chief Complaint: Acute abdominal pain and shortness of breath

History of Present Illness (HPI): A 39-year-old female presented to the emergency department with a chief complaint of severe, persistent abdominal pain that began suddenly over the past 6 hours. The patient also reported experiencing dyspnea, or shortness of breath, over the same timeframe. She described the abdominal pain as sharp and localized in the lower right quadrant, accompanied by nausea and vomiting. The pain worsened with movement and deep breathing, and she reported feeling lightheaded and diaphoretic (sweaty).

Physical Examination Findings: Upon initial assessment, the patient appeared uncomfortable and distressed. Vital signs revealed a heart rate of 120 beats per minute, blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on room air. Abdominal examination revealed localized tenderness in the lower right quadrant with guarding and rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds were hypoactive.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, and severity level, a provisional diagnosis of acute appendicitis was made. The patient's shortness of breath may be related to anxiety or potential complications from the appendicitis.

Plan / Treatment: The patient was immediately admitted for further evaluation and management. Laboratory tests were ordered, including complete blood count (CBC), electrolytes, and inflammatory markers. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis was also requested to confirm the diagnosis and assess for any complications. Intravenous fluids and oxygen therapy were initiated to address the patient's symptoms.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the hospital. Surgical consultation has been arranged, and the patient should expect to undergo an appendectomy if the CT scan confirms the diagnosis of acute appendicitis. The patient will receive further instructions regarding postoperative care and follow-up appointments upon discharge from the hospital.
