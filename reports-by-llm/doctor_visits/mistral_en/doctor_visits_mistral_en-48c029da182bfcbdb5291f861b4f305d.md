Chief Complaint: Acute shortness of breath and chest pain

History of Present Illness (HPI): A 76-year-old female presented to the emergency department with a two-hour history of progressive shortness of breath and central chest pain that radiates to her left arm. The patient reports feeling lightheaded and experiencing cold sweats. She denies any recent trauma, fever, or cough but mentions a history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus type 2.

Physical Examination Findings: Vital signs reveal tachycardia (110 bpm), hypotension (90/60 mmHg), respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 88% on room air. Auscultation of the heart reveals a regular tachycardia with an audible S4 gallop. Lung examination reveals bilateral crackles in the lower lung fields.

Assessment / Diagnosis: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with acute decompensated heart failure, likely due to worsening of her underlying hypertension and diabetes mellitus.

Plan / Treatment: The patient is immediately started on intravenous furosemide for diuresis, nitroglycerin for afterload reduction, and enalapril for long-term management of heart failure. Oxygen therapy is initiated to maintain oxygen saturation above 90%. EKG and echocardiography are ordered for further evaluation.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be admitted to the cardiac care unit for close monitoring and further management. A follow-up appointment with her primary care physician will be scheduled within one week of discharge. The patient is advised to continue taking her prescribed medications as directed and to return immediately if symptoms worsen or new symptoms develop.
