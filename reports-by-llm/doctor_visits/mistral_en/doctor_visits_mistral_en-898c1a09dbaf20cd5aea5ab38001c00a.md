Chief Complaint: Acute shortness of breath and chest pain

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 72-year-old male, presented to the emergency department with complaints of sudden onset of severe chest pain radiating to his left arm accompanied by profuse sweating and dyspnea. The symptoms began approximately 3 hours ago while he was at home and have since worsened. He denies any preceding trauma or recent illnesses.

Physical Examination Findings: Upon initial assessment, the patient appeared anxious and in distress. Vital signs revealed a heart rate of 140 bpm, blood pressure of 160/95 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 88% on room air. Auscultation of the chest revealed diminished breath sounds and a systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's age, acute symptoms, and physical examination findings, the working diagnosis is suspected acute coronary syndrome (ACS), likely myocardial infarction.

Plan / Treatment: The patient was immediately transferred to the cardiac catheterization laboratory for urgent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Aspirin, clopidogrel, and heparin were administered en route. Oxygen therapy was initiated to improve oxygen saturation levels.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the cardiac care unit post-procedure. A follow-up appointment with a cardiologist will be scheduled within one week for further management and risk factor modification recommendations. The patient is advised to continue taking prescribed medications as directed and to return immediately if symptoms recur or worsen.

It is essential that the patient adheres to a heart-healthy lifestyle, including regular exercise, a balanced diet, and smoking cessation, to reduce the risk of future cardiac events.
