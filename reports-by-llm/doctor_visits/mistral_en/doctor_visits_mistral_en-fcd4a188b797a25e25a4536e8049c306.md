Chief Complaint: Dyspnea and generalized weakness

History of Present Illness (HPI): A 105-year-old female presented to the emergency department with a two-day history of progressive dyspnea, orthopnea, and non-productive cough. The patient also reported generalized weakness and fatigue. She denied any chest pain, fever, or hemoptysis. Her past medical history is significant for hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

Physical Examination Findings: Vital signs revealed a heart rate of 120 bpm, blood pressure of 160/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 88% on room air, and temperature of 37.5°C (99.5°F). The patient appeared acutely ill, with labored breathing and accessory muscle use. Auscultation of the chest revealed decreased breath sounds bilaterally, with crackles at the bases.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's age, comorbidities, and presentation, an exacerbation of COPD is suspected. The patient's hypoxemia and respiratory distress indicate a severe exacerbation requiring immediate attention.

Plan / Treatment: The patient was immediately started on high-flow oxygen therapy, nebulized bronchodilators, and intravenous corticosteroids. A chest X-ray was ordered to confirm the diagnosis and assess for complications such as pneumonia. The patient will be closely monitored in the intensive care unit (ICU) due to her severe respiratory distress.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will remain in the ICU for close monitoring and further management of her COPD exacerbation. A pulmonologist will be consulted for ongoing management, and a follow-up appointment will be scheduled upon discharge from the hospital. The patient's family has been informed of the situation and is encouraged to stay involved in the care plan.
