Chief Complaint: Acute dyspnea and orthopnea in a nonagenarian male

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, an elderly gentleman aged 96 years, presented to the emergency department with complaints of increasing shortness of breath over the past week. He reported that he was particularly troubled by his symptoms when lying flat and had noticed a dry cough and mild orthopnea. His family mentioned that he has been experiencing intermittent chest pain as well. The patient's medical history includes hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and congestive heart failure, for which he is currently on multiple medications.

Physical Examination Findings: Upon examination, the patient appeared breathless and diaphoretic. His blood pressure was 160/90 mmHg, pulse rate was 120 beats per minute, respiratory rate was 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation was 88% on room air. Auscultation of the chest revealed bilateral crackles, and a cardiac examination revealed an irregularly irregular heart rhythm.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's history, symptoms, and physical findings, it is suspected that he may be experiencing an acute exacerbation of his COPD and congestive heart failure.

Plan / Treatment: The patient was immediately started on high-flow oxygen therapy, intravenous diuretics for congestive heart failure management, and a short course of bronchodilators for COPD exacerbation. An electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed to further evaluate his irregular heart rhythm.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the hospital for at least 48 hours. A chest X-ray and echocardiography are planned for tomorrow to assess the extent of his lung and heart involvement. The patient's family has been informed about the current situation and the need for close follow-up.

It is crucial that the patient continues his regular medications post-discharge, with close coordination between primary care providers and specialists. A follow-up appointment will be scheduled within a week to assess his response to treatment and adjust medications as necessary.
