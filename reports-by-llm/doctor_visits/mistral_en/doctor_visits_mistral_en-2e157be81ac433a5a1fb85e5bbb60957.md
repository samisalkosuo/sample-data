Clinic or Hospital Location: Utaj√§rvi Health Center

Severity Level: 3 (Urgent)
Patient Gender: Male
Patient Age: 99

Chief Complaint:
Acute respiratory distress and severe fatigue

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient, a nonagenarian male, presented to the emergency department with a sudden onset of shortness of breath, coughing, and extreme fatigue over the past 24 hours. He reported feeling progressively weaker and experiencing increased difficulty breathing, particularly when lying down or exerting himself. The patient also noted a productive cough producing clear, frothy sputum. He denied any chest pain, fever, chills, or recent travel or exposure to sick individuals.

Physical Examination Findings:
Upon examination, the patient appeared acutely ill and was breathing rapidly with labored effort. His pulse was rapid and irregular, and his blood pressure was low. Auscultation of the chest revealed decreased breath sounds and crackles in the lower lung fields. The patient's oxygen saturation was 88% on room air, which improved to 94% with supplemental oxygen.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with acute congestive heart failure exacerbation or pneumonia. Given his advanced age and comorbidities, further diagnostic tests such as chest X-ray, electrocardiogram (ECG), and blood tests were ordered to confirm the diagnosis and assess the severity of the condition.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient was immediately started on oxygen therapy, intravenous diuretics for congestive heart failure management, and broad-spectrum antibiotics for possible pneumonia. Close monitoring of vital signs, electrolytes, and renal function is essential due to the patient's age and multiple comorbidities.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient will be closely monitored in the hospital for at least 48 hours. A follow-up appointment with the primary care provider will be scheduled upon discharge, along with arrangements for home healthcare services as needed. The patient should continue taking prescribed medications and report any worsening symptoms promptly.
