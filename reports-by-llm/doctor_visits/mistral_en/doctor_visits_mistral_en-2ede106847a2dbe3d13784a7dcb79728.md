Chief Complaint: Acute abdominal pain and vomiting in an 8-year-old male patient

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient presented with a 6-hour history of progressive, severe abdominal pain localized to the lower right quadrant. The pain is constant and aggravated by movement and deep breathing. Accompanying symptoms include repeated vomiting and decreased appetite. No associated fever or bowel movements were reported.

Physical Examination Findings: On examination, the patient appears uncomfortable but cooperative. Vital signs reveal a heart rate of 120 bpm, blood pressure of 90/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and temperature of 37.5°C (99.5°F). Abdominal examination reveals localized tenderness in the lower right quadrant with guarding and rebound tenderness. No distension or rigidity was noted.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's age, acute onset of symptoms, and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of appendicitis is suspected. The severity level is 4 due to the presence of abdominal pain and guarding.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be admitted for further evaluation and management. Initial treatment includes intravenous fluids, analgesia, and antibiotics. A diagnostic ultrasound or CT scan will be performed to confirm the diagnosis and assess for any complications. Surgical consultation has been requested.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the hospital. Follow-up appointments will be scheduled with the pediatric surgeon and primary care provider as appropriate. The patient's parents have been instructed to contact the hospital if the pain worsens or if there are any changes in vomiting patterns or bowel movements.
