Severity Level: 3 (Urgent)
Patient Gender: Male
Patient Age: 56

Chief Complaint:
Acute abdominal pain and shortness of breath.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient presented to the emergency department with a sudden onset of severe, constant abdominal pain localized in the lower right quadrant, accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and decreased appetite for the past 24 hours. The pain has been exacerbated by movement and deep breathing, and is associated with a low-grade fever (38°C). Additionally, the patient reported experiencing shortness of breath over the past few hours, with increased respiratory rate and effort.

Physical Examination Findings:
Upon examination, the patient appeared uncomfortable but alert. Vital signs revealed a blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg, pulse rate of 110 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and temperature of 38°C. Abdominal examination revealed localized tenderness in the lower right quadrant with guarding and rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds were hypoactive. The patient's abdomen was distended, and there was no palpable mass or hernia. Lung auscultation revealed decreased breath sounds on the right side, suggestive of possible pleural involvement.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
The presentation is concerning for an acute appendicitis with possible associated pleurisy. The patient requires urgent surgical intervention due to the severity and progression of symptoms.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient will be admitted to the hospital for further evaluation and management. Initial treatment includes intravenous fluid resuscitation, pain management, and antibiotics to prevent potential complications. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and chest will be ordered to confirm the diagnosis and assess for any other underlying conditions.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient will be seen by a general surgeon for further evaluation and possible appendectomy. The surgical team will discuss the details of the procedure, including risks and benefits, with the patient and their family. Postoperative care instructions will be provided upon discharge from the hospital. The patient is advised to return for follow-up appointments as scheduled by the surgical team.

It is essential that the patient seeks immediate medical attention if symptoms worsen or persist after discharge.
