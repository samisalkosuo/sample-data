Severity Level: 3 (Urgent)
Patient Gender: Male
Patient Age: 88

Chief Complaint:
Acute shortness of breath and chest pain

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient, an 88-year-old male, presented to the emergency department complaining of sudden onset of severe shortness of breath and sharp, persistent chest pain that radiates to his left arm. The symptoms began approximately 3 hours ago while he was at home and have since worsened. He denies any associated symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, or coughing up blood. His medical history includes hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease.

Physical Examination Findings:
Upon examination, the patient appears anxious and in distress. Vital signs reveal a heart rate of 120 bpm, blood pressure of 160/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 88% on room air, and temperature of 37.5°C (99.5°F). Lung auscultation reveals decreased breath sounds and crackles in the left lower lung field. Cardiovascular examination reveals a regular tachycardia with a systolic murmur heard best at the left upper sternal border.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
The patient's symptoms, along with his medical history and physical examination findings, suggest an acute coronary syndrome, most likely an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).

Plan / Treatment:
Upon arrival, the patient was immediately administered aspirin and nitroglycerin. He will be transferred to the cardiac catheterization laboratory for urgent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stenting. Intravenous heparin and beta-blockers will be initiated in the emergency department.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient will be closely monitored in the cardiac care unit post-procedure. A follow-up appointment with his primary care physician will be scheduled within one week for further management and optimization of his other medical conditions. The patient will also be referred to cardiac rehabilitation.
