Chief Complaint: Acute shortness of breath and chest pain

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, an 80-year-old male, presented to the emergency department with a sudden onset of severe shortness of breath and sharp, persistent chest pain that radiates to his left arm. He reports feeling lightheaded and experiencing profuse sweating. The symptoms began approximately two hours ago while he was at home. The patient has a history of hypertension and coronary artery disease, for which he is currently on medication.

Physical Examination Findings: Upon examination, the patient appears distressed with an elevated respiratory rate and heart rate. His blood pressure is 180/95 mmHg. Auscultation of the chest reveals diminished breath sounds in the left lung base, with a systolic murmur audible at the cardiac apex.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's history, acute symptoms, and physical examination findings, it is highly suspected that the patient is experiencing an acute coronary syndrome, possibly a myocardial infarction (heart attack).

Plan / Treatment: The patient was immediately transferred to the cardiac catheterization laboratory for urgent angiography. He received aspirin and nitroglycerin intravenously upon arrival to relieve symptoms and reduce myocardial damage. Oxygen therapy was initiated to support ventilation.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the cardiac care unit post-procedure. A follow-up appointment with a cardiologist will be scheduled within one week for further management and risk factor modification recommendations. The patient's family has been informed of the situation and is encouraged to remain supportive during this critical period.
