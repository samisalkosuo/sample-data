Clinic or Hospital Location: Kauhajoki Health Center

Severity Level: 4 (Less-urgent)
Patient Gender: Female
Patient Age: 88

Chief Complaint:
Dizziness and falls over the past week, with increasing frequency.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient, an 88-year-old female, has been experiencing recurrent episodes of dizziness and falls for approximately one week. The symptoms began as occasional lightheadedness but have progressively worsened, leading to multiple falls at home. She reports no associated chest pain, shortness of breath, or loss of consciousness during these events. The patient denies any headaches, visual disturbances, or hearing problems.

Physical Examination Findings:
Upon examination, the patient appeared alert and oriented but exhibited signs of mild unsteadiness upon standing and walking. Blood pressure was 140/85 mmHg, pulse rate was 92 beats per minute, respiratory rate was 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation was 97% on room air. No abnormalities were noted in the cardiovascular, pulmonary, or neurological examinations.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
The patient's symptoms are suggestive of orthostatic hypotension, possibly due to medication side effects or age-related autonomic dysfunction. Further evaluation may include a 24-hour blood pressure monitoring and review of current medications.

Plan / Treatment:
Initiate a trial of fluid and salt supplementation, as well as midodrine hydrochloride (Orthostat) to improve orthostatic symptoms. The patient will be advised to avoid rapid position changes and to rise slowly from a seated or lying position. A follow-up appointment is scheduled in one week to assess the response to treatment and adjust medications as necessary.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient should return for a follow-up visit on 19.05.2025 to discuss the effectiveness of the current treatment plan and any concerns or questions regarding her symptoms. In the meantime, she is encouraged to contact the clinic if her dizziness worsens or if she experiences additional falls. It is also recommended that she maintain a regular exercise regimen, as approved by her primary care physician, to improve overall balance and stability.
