Chief Complaint: Acute abdominal pain and shortness of breath

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 46-year-old male, presented to the emergency department with a sudden onset of severe abdominal pain localized in the lower right quadrant, accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and shortness of breath. The symptoms began approximately 8 hours ago and have since worsened. The patient reports feeling lightheaded and experiencing rapid heartbeat. He denies any history of trauma or recent travel.

Physical Examination Findings: Upon examination, the patient appears distressed with a pulse rate of 120 beats per minute, blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on room air. Abdominal examination reveals localized tenderness in the lower right quadrant with guarding and rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds are hypoactive.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, and urgent severity level, a diagnosis of acute appendicitis with possible peritonitis is suspected.

Plan / Treatment: The patient requires immediate surgical intervention for appendectomy. Intravenous fluids will be administered to correct dehydration, and antibiotics will be initiated to prevent infection spread. Oxygen therapy will also be provided to manage the shortness of breath.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be admitted to the hospital for further management and monitoring. A follow-up appointment with the general surgeon will be scheduled within 24 hours post-surgery to assess recovery progress.
