Chief Complaint: Acute abdominal pain and shortness of breath

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 44-year-old male, presented to the emergency department with complaints of severe, constant abdominal pain that started abruptly 6 hours ago. The pain is localized in the lower right quadrant and radiates to the back. Accompanying symptoms include nausea, vomiting, and shortness of breath. The patient reports feeling lightheaded and experiencing a rapid heartbeat.

Physical Examination Findings: Upon examination, the patient appears distressed with a pulse rate of 120 beats per minute, blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on room air. Abdominal examination reveals localized tenderness in the lower right quadrant with guarding and rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds are hypoactive.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of acute appendicitis with possible peritonitis is suspected. The patient's presentation falls under Severity Level 3 due to the potential for rapid deterioration if left untreated.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be admitted to the hospital for further management. Initial treatment includes intravenous fluid resuscitation, pain management, and antibiotics to prevent complications. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and ultrasound will be performed to confirm the diagnosis and assess for any complications.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the hospital. Surgical consultation has been requested, and the patient should expect an appendectomy within 24 hours if the CT scan confirms the diagnosis. The patient will receive further instructions regarding postoperative care and follow-up appointments upon discharge from the hospital.

It is essential that the patient returns for follow-up visits as scheduled to ensure proper healing and prevent any potential complications.
