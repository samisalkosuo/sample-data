Chief Complaint: Acute shortness of breath and chest pain

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 94-year-old female, presented to the emergency department with complaints of sudden onset of severe shortness of breath and sharp, persistent chest pain that radiates to her left arm. She reports experiencing these symptoms for approximately 2 hours prior to arrival. The patient also mentions feeling lightheaded and profusely sweating. She denies any recent trauma or known allergies.

Physical Examination Findings: Upon initial assessment, the patient appears distressed with a respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg, and heart rate of 130 beats per minute. Auscultation reveals decreased breath sounds on the left side, and there is tenderness upon palpation of the chest wall.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's age, acute symptoms, and physical examination findings, a working diagnosis of possible acute coronary syndrome (ACS) with potential complications such as pulmonary edema is suspected.

Plan / Treatment: The patient was immediately administered oxygen, morphine for pain management, and aspirin to reduce the risk of further thrombus formation. An electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed, which showed ST-segment elevation in several leads, confirming a diagnosis of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The patient was subsequently transferred to the cardiac catheterization laboratory for urgent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

Follow-up Instructions: Post-procedure, the patient will be closely monitored in the intensive care unit (ICU) for at least 24 hours. A follow-up appointment with a cardiologist will be scheduled within one week to assess the need for further medication and lifestyle modifications. The patient's family has been informed of the situation and is encouraged to stay involved in her care during this critical period.
