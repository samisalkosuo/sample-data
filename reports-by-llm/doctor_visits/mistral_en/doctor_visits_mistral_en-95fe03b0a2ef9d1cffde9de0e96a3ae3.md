Chief Complaint: Acute abdominal pain and shortness of breath

History of Present Illness (HPI): A 48-year-old female presented to the emergency department with a 6-hour history of severe, constant abdominal pain localized in the lower left quadrant. The pain radiates to her back and is accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and shortness of breath. She denies any trauma or recent changes in bowel habits. Her symptoms worsened over the past hour, with increased abdominal distension and rapid shallow breathing.

Physical Examination Findings: Vital signs reveal a heart rate of 120 bpm, blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, temperature of 37.8°C (100°F), and oxygen saturation of 92% on room air. Abdominal examination reveals tenderness in the left lower quadrant with guarding and rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds are hypoactive. The patient appears uncomfortable and anxious.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the acute onset, localized abdominal pain, and signs of peritoneal irritation, the patient is suspected to have an appendicitis with possible rupture. The shortness of breath may be due to diaphragm irritation or associated pleural involvement.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will receive intravenous fluids, pain medication, and antibiotics for empiric coverage of common appendicular pathogens. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast is indicated to confirm the diagnosis and assess for any complications such as perforation or free air. Surgical consultation will be sought for possible emergent appendectomy.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be admitted to the hospital for further management and monitoring. A surgical consult will be performed today, and a decision on the timing of surgery will be made based on the CT scan results and clinical status. The patient should expect frequent vital sign checks and pain assessments while in the hospital.
