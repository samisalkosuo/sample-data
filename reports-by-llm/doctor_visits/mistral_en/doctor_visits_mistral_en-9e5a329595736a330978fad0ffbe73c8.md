Chief Complaint: Acute shortness of breath and chest pain

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 68-year-old female, presented to the emergency department with complaints of sudden onset of severe shortness of breath and sharp, persistent chest pain that radiated to her left arm. She reported experiencing these symptoms while climbing stairs at home earlier today. The pain worsened over the past hour, accompanied by profuse sweating and a feeling of anxiety. She denies any history of trauma or recent infections.

Physical Examination Findings: Upon examination, the patient appeared distressed with an elevated respiratory rate (24 breaths/min) and heart rate (130 bpm). Her blood pressure was 160/95 mmHg. Auscultation of the chest revealed decreased breath sounds and a systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border. Oxygen saturation was 88% on room air, which improved to 94% with supplemental oxygen.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's acute symptoms, tachycardia, and murmur, a working diagnosis of an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is suspected. Further evaluation is needed to determine if this is a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) or unstable angina.

Plan / Treatment: The patient was immediately started on aspirin, nitroglycerin, and morphine for pain relief and to reduce oxygen demand on the heart. Electrocardiogram (ECG), cardiac enzymes, and troponin levels were ordered. A cardiology consultation was requested for further management and potential coronary angiography.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the cardiac care unit. She is advised to continue taking prescribed medications as directed by her healthcare team. A follow-up appointment with a cardiologist will be scheduled within 24 hours for further evaluation and management of her condition.
