Chief Complaint: Acute abdominal pain and vomiting

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 17-year-old male, presented to the emergency department with a 6-hour history of severe, constant abdominal pain localized primarily in the lower right quadrant. The pain is described as sharp and radiating to the groin area. Accompanying symptoms include frequent vomiting and decreased bowel movements. The patient reports no relief with over-the-counter pain medication. He denies any history of trauma, fever, or recent travel.

Physical Examination Findings: Vital signs reveal a heart rate of 110 bpm, blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. On abdominal examination, there is localized tenderness in the lower right quadrant with guarding and rebound tenderness. No distension or rigidity was noted.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's age, acute onset of symptoms, and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of appendicitis is suspected. The severity level indicates an urgent need for further evaluation and management due to potential life-threatening complications.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be admitted for further diagnostic imaging (ultrasound or CT scan) to confirm the diagnosis. If appendicitis is confirmed, surgical intervention will be required. Intravenous fluids and pain medication will be administered as needed.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be followed up by a surgeon for further management. He should expect to undergo an appendectomy within the next 24 hours. Postoperative instructions, including pain management, diet, and activity restrictions, will be provided upon discharge. A follow-up appointment with his primary care provider is recommended within one week of discharge for continued monitoring.
