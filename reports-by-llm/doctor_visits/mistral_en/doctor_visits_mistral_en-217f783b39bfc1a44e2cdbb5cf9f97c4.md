Clinic or Hospital Location: Hammarland General Hospital

Severity Level: 4 (Less-urgent)
Patient Gender: Female
Patient Age: 69

**Chief Complaint:**
The patient presented with a persistent, severe headache and dizziness over the past three days.

**History of Present Illness (HPI):**
Upon admission, the patient reported a constant, throbbing headache localized on the right side of her forehead that has been gradually worsening for the past 72 hours. Accompanying symptoms include nausea, photophobia, and occasional vomiting. The patient also mentioned feeling lightheaded and unsteady on her feet, particularly when standing or changing positions. She denies any visual disturbances, speech difficulties, or limb weakness. There is no history of trauma, fever, or recent travel.

**Physical Examination Findings:**
Vital signs: Blood pressure 150/90 mmHg, pulse rate 98 bpm, respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, temperature 37.2°C (99°F), oxygen saturation 98% on room air. General appearance shows a well-nourished elderly female in mild distress. On neurological examination, there is tenderness upon palpation of the right frontal region and positive results for Romberg's test. Fundoscopy reveals no abnormalities.

**Assessment / Diagnosis:**
The patient's symptoms and physical findings are suggestive of a possible subarachnoid hemorrhage, likely due to aneurysmal rupture. However, further diagnostic tests are necessary for confirmation.

**Plan / Treatment:**
The patient will undergo a non-contrast CT scan of the brain followed by a lumbar puncture (CSF analysis) and cerebral angiography if indicated. If an aneurysm is detected, neurosurgical consultation will be sought for potential endovascular or surgical intervention. In the meantime, the patient will receive analgesics for pain management and antiemetics to control nausea and vomiting.

**Follow-up Instructions:**
The patient should remain in the hospital for further evaluation and treatment as needed. A neurology consultation has been scheduled for tomorrow morning to discuss the diagnostic results and treatment options. The patient will be closely monitored for any changes in symptoms or vital signs.
