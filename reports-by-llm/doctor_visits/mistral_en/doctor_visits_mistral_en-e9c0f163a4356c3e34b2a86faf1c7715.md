Chief Complaint: Acute shortness of breath and chest pain

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 91-year-old female, presented to the emergency department with complaints of sudden onset of severe shortness of breath and sharp, persistent chest pain that radiated to her left arm. She reported experiencing these symptoms for approximately 2 hours prior to arrival. The patient also mentioned feeling lightheaded and profusely sweating. She has a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease.

Physical Examination Findings: Upon examination, the patient appeared anxious and in distress. Her blood pressure was 180/95 mmHg, pulse rate was 120 beats per minute, respiratory rate was 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation was 88% on room air. Auscultation of the heart revealed a regular tachycardia with an audible S4 gallop. Lung auscultation revealed decreased breath sounds and crackles in the left lower lung field.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's age, medical history, and acute symptoms, the working diagnosis is likely an acute coronary syndrome, such as a myocardial infarction or unstable angina. The presence of chest pain radiating to the left arm, shortness of breath, and tachycardia with an S4 gallop are consistent with this diagnosis.

Plan / Treatment: The patient was immediately started on oxygen therapy and given aspirin, nitroglycerin, and morphine for symptomatic relief. An electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed, which showed ST-segment elevation in the leads V1-V6, confirming a suspected acute myocardial infarction. The patient was subsequently transferred to the cardiac catheterization laboratory for urgent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the cardiac care unit following PCI. A follow-up appointment with her primary care physician and cardiologist will be scheduled within one week to discuss further management, including medications, lifestyle modifications, and rehabilitation. The patient was also advised to seek immediate medical attention if any recurrence of symptoms occurs.
