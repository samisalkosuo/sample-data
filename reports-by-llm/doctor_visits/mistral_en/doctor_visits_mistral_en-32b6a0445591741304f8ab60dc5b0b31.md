Clinic or Hospital Location: Pihtipudas Health Center

Severity Level: 2 (Emergent)
Patient Gender: Female
Patient Age: 76

Chief Complaint:
Acute shortness of breath and chest pain

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient presented to the emergency department complaining of sudden onset of severe chest pain, radiating to the left arm, accompanied by dyspnea. The symptoms began approximately 3 hours ago and have been progressively worsening. She reports feeling a tightness in her chest, associated with a pressure-like sensation, and shortness of breath that leaves her unable to complete simple tasks without exertion. She denies any preceding trauma or known allergies.

Physical Examination Findings:
Upon initial assessment, the patient appeared anxious and diaphoretic. Her blood pressure was 160/95 mmHg, pulse rate was 120 beats per minute, respiratory rate was 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation was 88% on room air. Auscultation of the heart revealed a regular tachycardia with an audible S4 gallop. Lung auscultation revealed bilateral crackles, particularly in the left lower lobe.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
The patient's presentation is concerning for acute coronary syndrome (ACS), potentially a myocardial infarction given her age and symptoms. The presence of an S4 gallop and pulmonary edema on examination further supports this diagnosis.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient was immediately started on aspirin, nitroglycerin, and morphine for pain relief and to reduce afterload. Oxygen therapy was initiated to improve oxygen saturation levels. An electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed and showed ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads, consistent with an acute myocardial infarction. The patient was subsequently transferred to the cardiac catheterization laboratory for urgent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient will be closely monitored during her stay in the cardiac care unit. A follow-up appointment with a cardiologist will be scheduled upon discharge, along with recommendations for lifestyle modifications and cardiac rehabilitation. The patient should also follow up with her primary care physician within one week for further management of any comorbidities.
