Chief Complaint: Acute abdominal pain and shortness of breath

History of Present Illness (HPI): A 59-year-old female presented to the emergency department with a chief complaint of severe, constant abdominal pain that began suddenly approximately 6 hours ago. The patient also reported experiencing dyspnea, or shortness of breath, over the past hour. She described the abdominal pain as sharp and localized in the lower right quadrant, accompanied by nausea and vomiting. The pain has been exacerbated by any movement or deep breathing.

Physical Examination Findings: Upon initial assessment, the patient appeared distressed and diaphoretic. Vital signs revealed a heart rate of 120 beats per minute, blood pressure of 90/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on room air. Abdominal examination elicited tenderness in the lower right quadrant with guarding and rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds were hypoactive.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's acute abdominal pain, localized to the right lower quadrant, associated with guarding, rebound tenderness, and hypoactive bowel sounds, a diagnosis of appendicitis is strongly suspected. The shortness of breath may be related to the patient's underlying condition or could be a complication of the appendicitis.

Plan / Treatment: The patient was immediately admitted for further evaluation and management. Intravenous fluids were initiated, and broad-spectrum antibiotics were administered to cover potential intra-abdominal infection. Pain management with opioid analgesics was provided. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis was ordered to confirm the diagnosis and assess for any complications such as perforation or abscess formation.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the hospital setting. Surgical consultation has been requested, and the decision for appendectomy will be made based on the results of the CT scan and the patient's clinical status. The patient should expect frequent assessments of vital signs, pain levels, and abdominal symptoms. A follow-up appointment with the surgeon will be scheduled postoperatively to discuss the surgical findings and recovery plan.
