Chief Complaint: Acute shortness of breath and chest pain

History of Present Illness (HPI): A 79-year-old female presented to the emergency department with a two-hour history of progressive shortness of breath and central chest pain that radiates to her left arm. The patient reports associated symptoms of lightheadedness, nausea, and cold sweats. She denies any recent trauma or exertional activity prior to symptom onset.

Physical Examination Findings: Vital signs reveal a heart rate of 120 bpm, blood pressure of 140/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on room air. Auscultation of the chest reveals bilateral crackles and a systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's age, acute symptoms, and physical examination findings, this presentation is concerning for an acute coronary syndrome (ACS), specifically a possible myocardial infarction (MI).

Plan / Treatment: The patient was immediately started on aspirin, nitroglycerin, and oxygen therapy. An electrocardiogram (ECG) was obtained, which showed ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads, confirming an ST-elevation MI (STEMI). The patient was transferred to the cardiac catheterization laboratory for urgent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored during and after the PCI procedure. She is expected to remain in the hospital for several days for further management and monitoring. A follow-up appointment with her cardiologist will be scheduled upon discharge, along with recommendations for lifestyle modifications and long-term medication therapy.
