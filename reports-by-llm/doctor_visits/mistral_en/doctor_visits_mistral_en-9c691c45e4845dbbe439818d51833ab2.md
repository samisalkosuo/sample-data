Chief Complaint: Acute abdominal pain and vomiting

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 17-year-old male, presented to the emergency department with a 6-hour history of severe, intermittent abdominal pain localized primarily in the lower right quadrant. The pain is described as sharp and constant, accompanied by frequent vomiting and mild fever (38Â°C). He reports no preceding trauma or injury, but has experienced progressive worsening of symptoms over the past few hours.

Physical Examination Findings: On initial assessment, the patient appears uncomfortable but alert. Vital signs reveal tachycardia (heart rate 120 bpm) and mild hypertension (blood pressure 145/90 mmHg). Abdominal examination reveals localized tenderness in the lower right quadrant with guarding and rebound tenderness, suggestive of possible appendicitis.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, and age, a diagnosis of acute appendicitis is strongly suspected. The severity level indicates an urgent need for further evaluation and management due to the potential life-threatening nature of this condition.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be admitted for immediate surgical consultation and possible appendectomy. Intravenous fluids, pain medication, and antibiotics will be administered to manage symptoms and prevent complications.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored postoperatively. Follow-up appointments with the surgeon and primary care provider will be scheduled as needed for wound care and recovery management. The patient should seek immediate medical attention if symptoms worsen or return.
