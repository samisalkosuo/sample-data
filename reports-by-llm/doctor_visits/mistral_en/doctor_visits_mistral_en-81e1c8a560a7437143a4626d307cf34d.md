Chief Complaint: Acute chest pain and shortness of breath

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 57-year-old male, presented to the emergency department with complaints of severe, crushing retrosternal chest pain that began approximately 2 hours ago. He described the pain as radiating to his left arm and jaw, accompanied by profuse sweating, nausea, and shortness of breath. The patient reported no preceding trauma or exertion prior to symptom onset.

Physical Examination Findings: Upon initial assessment, the patient appeared anxious and diaphoretic. Vital signs revealed a blood pressure of 160/95 mmHg, pulse rate of 120 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on room air. Cardiac examination demonstrated an irregular heart rhythm with audible S4 gallop. Lung auscultation revealed bilateral crackles.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's acute symptoms, age, and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is highly suspected, likely ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).

Plan / Treatment: The patient was immediately transferred to the cardiac catheterization laboratory for urgent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Aspirin, clopidogrel, and nitroglycerin were administered en route. Oxygen therapy and continuous electrocardiogram monitoring were initiated.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the cardiac care unit post-procedure. Follow-up appointments with the cardiologist will be scheduled for medication management, risk factor modification, and further evaluation as needed. Rehabilitation services may also be recommended.
