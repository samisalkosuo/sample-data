Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with a persistent, non-productive cough and mild shortness of breath over the past week.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient reported that her symptoms started gradually, with a dry, hacking cough that worsened throughout the day. She also mentioned experiencing occasional wheezing and mild chest discomfort. The symptoms have not responded to over-the-counter cough suppressants and expectorants. There is no associated fever, chills, or night sweats. The patient has a history of asthma but has been well-controlled with medication for the past few years.

Physical Examination Findings:
Upon examination, the patient appeared comfortable and was in no acute distress. Her vital signs were within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute. Auscultation of the chest revealed occasional wheezes on both lung fields, particularly on inspiration. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
Based on the patient's history and physical examination findings, it is suspected that she may be experiencing an exacerbation of her asthma.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient will be started on a short course of oral corticosteroids to reduce inflammation in her airways. Additionally, her current controller medication for asthma will be adjusted as needed. She has been instructed to use her rescue inhaler as prescribed and to monitor her peak flow readings daily.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient is scheduled to return for a follow-up appointment in one week to assess her response to treatment and adjust medications as necessary. She has been advised to seek immediate medical attention if her symptoms worsen or if she experiences any difficulty breathing. The patient was also provided with educational materials on asthma management and triggers to avoid.

It is important for the patient to continue taking her medication as prescribed, maintain a regular exercise routine, and avoid exposure to allergens and irritants. She should also schedule annual check-ups with her primary care provider to monitor her asthma control and adjust treatment plans as needed.
