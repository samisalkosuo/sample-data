Chief Complaint: Acute abdominal pain and vomiting

History of Present Illness (HPI): A 17-year-old female presented to the emergency department with a 6-hour history of severe, constant, and localized lower abdominal pain that radiated to her back. The pain was accompanied by repeated episodes of non-bloody vomiting. She also reported feeling lightheaded and experiencing chills. The patient denied any trauma or recent surgery.

Physical Examination Findings: Vital signs revealed a heart rate of 120 bpm, blood pressure of 90/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and temperature of 37.5°C (99.5°F). On abdominal examination, there was tenderness in the lower left quadrant with guarding and rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds were hypoactive.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's symptoms, physical findings, and age, an acute appendicitis is suspected. The urgent nature of the presentation warrants further investigation to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential causes of abdominal pain.

Plan / Treatment: The patient was immediately admitted for intravenous fluid resuscitation and pain management. Laboratory tests were ordered, including complete blood count (CBC), electrolytes, and C-reactive protein (CRP). An abdominal ultrasound will be performed to confirm the diagnosis of appendicitis. If confirmed, surgical intervention will be necessary.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the hospital for any signs of sepsis or complications. A follow-up appointment with a general surgeon will be scheduled after discharge to discuss further management and recovery plan. The patient is advised to seek immediate medical attention if symptoms worsen or new symptoms develop.
