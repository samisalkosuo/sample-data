Chief Complaint: Acute abdominal pain and shortness of breath

History of Present Illness (HPI): A 23-year-old male presented to the emergency department with a two-hour history of severe, constant, and localized abdominal pain in the lower right quadrant. The pain radiates to the periumbilical region and is accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and shortness of breath. The patient reports feeling lightheaded and experiencing chills. He denies any trauma or recent travel but admits to a history of intermittent fever and diarrhea over the past week.

Physical Examination Findings: Vital signs reveal tachycardia (heart rate 120 bpm), hypotension (blood pressure 90/60 mmHg), and respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute. Abdominal examination reveals localized tenderness in the lower right quadrant with guarding and rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds are hypoactive, and there is no distension or rigidity. The patient appears pale and diaphoretic.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, and history of fever and diarrhea, a diagnosis of acute appendicitis with possible peritonitis is suspected. The severity level is 3 due to the presence of abdominal tenderness, tachycardia, hypotension, and shortness of breath.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be admitted for intravenous fluid resuscitation, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and pain management. An urgent ultrasound will be performed to confirm the diagnosis, followed by an appendectomy if appropriate.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the hospital's intensive care unit. A follow-up appointment with a general surgeon will be scheduled for postoperative care and recovery instructions. The patient is advised to inform his primary care provider of this hospitalization upon discharge.
