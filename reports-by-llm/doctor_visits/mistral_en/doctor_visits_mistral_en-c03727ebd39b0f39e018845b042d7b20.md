 Visit Date: July 21, 2024
Clinic or Hospital Location: Lumparland General Hospital

Severity Level: 2 (Emergent)
Patient Gender: Male
Patient Age: 30

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with acute abdominal pain and shortness of breath.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient reported sudden onset of severe, constant abdominal pain localized to the lower right quadrant that began approximately 6 hours ago. The pain is accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and a feeling of lightheadedness. Additionally, he has been experiencing shortness of breath for the past hour. He denies any trauma or recent changes in diet or medication.

Physical Examination Findings:
Upon examination, the patient appears anxious but coherent. Vital signs reveal tachycardia (heart rate 120 bpm) and hypotension (blood pressure 90/60 mmHg). Abdominal examination reveals localized tenderness in the right lower quadrant with guarding and rebound tenderness, suggestive of possible appendicitis. Respiratory examination reveals decreased breath sounds on the right side, consistent with a possible pleural effusion.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is acute appendicitis with potential complications such as perforation and pleural effusion due to diaphragmatic irritation.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient requires immediate surgical intervention for suspected appendicitis. Intravenous fluids will be administered to correct hypotension, and oxygen therapy will be initiated for shortness of breath. Pain management will also be provided.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient will be admitted to the hospital for further evaluation and management by the surgical team. A follow-up appointment will be scheduled post-operatively to discuss recovery and any necessary post-operative care.
