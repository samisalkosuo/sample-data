Chief Complaint: Acute shortness of breath and chest pain

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 61-year-old female, presented to the emergency department with complaints of sudden onset of severe chest pain radiating to her left arm, accompanied by dyspnea. She reported that the symptoms began approximately 2 hours ago and have been progressively worsening since then. The patient also mentioned experiencing cold sweats and a feeling of anxiety.

Physical Examination Findings: Upon initial assessment, the patient appeared distressed with a respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, blood pressure of 160/95 mmHg, and heart rate of 130 beats per minute. Auscultation revealed diminished breath sounds on the left side, and there was no audible S1 or S2 heart sounds, suggesting possible cardiac tamponade.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's acute symptoms, tachycardia, hypotension, and physical examination findings, a provisional diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) with possible complications such as pericardial tamponade is suspected.

Plan / Treatment: The patient was immediately transferred to the cardiac catheterization laboratory for urgent coronary angiography. Intravenous aspirin, clopidogrel, and nitroglycerin were administered en route to manage symptoms and prevent further complications. Oxygen therapy was initiated to support ventilation.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the cardiac care unit post-procedure. A follow-up appointment with a cardiologist will be scheduled within 1 week for further management and evaluation of treatment options, including potential coronary intervention or medication therapy. The patient was advised to maintain a low-sodium diet, engage in regular exercise, and avoid smoking.

It is essential that the patient returns for follow-up appointments as scheduled to ensure proper management of her condition and prevent future complications.
