Chief Complaint: Acute shortness of breath and chest pain

History of Present Illness (HPI): A 93-year-old male presented to the emergency department complaining of sudden onset of severe shortness of breath, accompanied by sharp chest pain that radiates to his left arm. The symptoms began approximately two hours ago and have worsened since then. He reports feeling lightheaded and experiencing profuse sweating. The patient has a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease.

Physical Examination Findings: Upon examination, the patient appears anxious and in distress. His blood pressure is 180/95 mmHg, pulse rate is 120 beats per minute, respiratory rate is 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 88% on room air. Auscultation of the heart reveals a regular tachycardia with an audible S4 gallop. Lung auscultation reveals decreased breath sounds bilaterally, with crackles present in the lower lung fields.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's age, medical history, and acute symptoms, a suspected acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is highly likely. The possibility of congestive heart failure (CHF) due to decompensation cannot be ruled out.

Plan / Treatment: The patient was immediately started on oxygen therapy at 6 L/min via nasal cannula. A 12-lead ECG was performed, revealing ST-segment elevations in the anterior leads, consistent with an acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The patient was administered aspirin and a loading dose of clopidogrel. Intravenous heparin was initiated for anticoagulation. Nitroglycerin was given to relieve chest pain and reduce preload.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be transferred to the cardiac catheterization laboratory for urgent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Post-procedure, he will be admitted to the coronary care unit (CCU) for close monitoring. A follow-up appointment with his primary care physician will be scheduled upon discharge from the hospital. The patient's family has been informed of the situation and is encouraged to remain supportive during this critical time.
