Chief Complaint: Acute abdominal pain and vomiting

History of Present Illness (HPI): A 13-year-old female presented to the emergency department with a 6-hour history of progressively worsening, localized lower abdominal pain accompanied by repeated episodes of non-bloody vomiting. The patient also reported feeling lightheaded and experiencing chills. She denied any trauma or recent surgery.

Physical Examination Findings: Vital signs revealed a heart rate of 120 bpm, blood pressure of 90/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and temperature of 37.5°C (99.5°F). On abdominal examination, there was tenderness in the lower left quadrant with guarding and rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds were hypoactive.

Assessment / Diagnosis: The patient's presentation suggests an acute appendicitis based on the localized abdominal pain, vomiting, and physical examination findings.

Plan / Treatment: The patient was immediately admitted for intravenous fluid resuscitation and antibiotic therapy. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis was ordered to confirm the diagnosis. Surgical consultation was requested for possible appendectomy.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the hospital. A follow-up appointment with the surgeon will be scheduled after the procedure, if necessary. The patient should contact her primary care provider for any post-discharge concerns or questions.
