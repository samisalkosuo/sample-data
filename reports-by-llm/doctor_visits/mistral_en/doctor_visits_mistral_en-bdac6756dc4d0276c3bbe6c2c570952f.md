Chief Complaint: Acute abdominal pain and shortness of breath

History of Present Illness (HPI): A 20-year-old male presented to the emergency department with a 6-hour history of severe, constant abdominal pain localized primarily in the lower right quadrant. The pain radiates to the back and is associated with nausea, vomiting, and decreased bowel movements. Additionally, he reports sudden onset of shortness of breath, chest tightness, and palpitations over the past hour. He denies any trauma or recent surgery.

Physical Examination Findings: Vital signs reveal a heart rate of 120 bpm, blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on room air. On abdominal examination, there is localized tenderness in the lower right quadrant with guarding and rebound tenderness. The patient appears anxious and diaphoretic.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the acute onset, severe abdominal pain, and associated symptoms, this presentation is concerning for an appendicitis. The shortness of breath, chest tightness, and palpitations may be related to anxiety or potential complications from the appendicitis.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be admitted to the hospital for further evaluation and management. Initial treatment includes intravenous fluids, pain medication, and antibiotics. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis will be performed to confirm the diagnosis and assess for any complications. If appendicitis is confirmed, surgical removal (appendectomy) will be necessary.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the hospital. A surgical consultation has been arranged for further management. The patient should expect to stay in the hospital for several days post-surgery. Follow-up appointments with the surgeon and primary care provider will be scheduled as needed.
