Chief Complaint: Acute abdominal pain and vomiting

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 16-year-old male, presented to the emergency department with a sudden onset of severe, localized abdominal pain that began approximately 4 hours ago. The pain is constant, sharp, and radiates to the lower back. Accompanying symptoms include repeated vomiting and decreased appetite. The patient reports no history of trauma or recent changes in diet.

Physical Examination Findings: Vital signs reveal a heart rate of 120 bpm, blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and temperature of 38.5°C (101.3°F). On abdominal examination, there is tenderness in the lower right quadrant with guarding and rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds are hypoactive.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of appendicitis is suspected. The severity level indicates an urgent need for medical attention due to the potential life threat posed by this condition.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be admitted for further evaluation and management. Initial treatment includes intravenous fluids, pain medication, and antibiotics to prevent complications. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and ultrasound will be performed to confirm the diagnosis and assess the appendix's status.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the hospital for any signs of worsening symptoms or complications. Surgical consultation has been arranged, and the patient should expect an appendectomy within 24 hours if the diagnosis is confirmed. The patient will receive discharge instructions upon recovery, including follow-up appointments with a general surgeon to ensure proper healing and monitor for any postoperative complications.

It is essential that the patient follows all prescribed medications and instructions carefully to ensure a successful outcome. If symptoms worsen or if there are concerns before the scheduled follow-up appointment, the patient should seek immediate medical attention.
