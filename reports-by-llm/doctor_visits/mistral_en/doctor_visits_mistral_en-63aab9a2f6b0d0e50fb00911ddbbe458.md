Chief Complaint: Acute abdominal pain and vomiting in a 7-year-old female patient

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient presented with a 6-hour history of intermittent, severe abdominal pain localized primarily to the lower right quadrant. The pain is described as crampy and constant, accompanied by multiple episodes of non-bloody vomiting. The onset was sudden, and there have been no associated fever or changes in bowel movements. The patient's appetite has decreased, and she appears uncomfortable but alert.

Physical Examination Findings: Vital signs reveal a heart rate of 120 bpm, blood pressure of 95/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and temperature of 37.2째C (98.96째F). On abdominal examination, there is localized tenderness in the lower right quadrant with guarding and rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds are hypoactive. No signs of peritonitis were observed.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the acute onset, localized abdominal pain, and physical examination findings, the patient is suspected to have appendicitis, a surgical emergency requiring prompt intervention.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be admitted for further evaluation and management. Initial laboratory tests including complete blood count (CBC), electrolytes, and inflammatory markers will be ordered. Intravenous fluids will be initiated to address dehydration. Pain management with appropriate analgesics will also be provided.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will undergo an abdominal ultrasound or computed tomography (CT) scan for definitive diagnosis and surgical consultation. If appendicitis is confirmed, the plan is for prompt surgical intervention. The patient's parents will be kept informed of her progress and any necessary follow-up arrangements will be discussed upon discharge.
