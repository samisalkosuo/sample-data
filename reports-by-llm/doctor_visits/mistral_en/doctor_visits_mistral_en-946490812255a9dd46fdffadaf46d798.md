Chief Complaint: Acute shortness of breath and chest pain

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 71-year-old female, presented to the emergency department with complaints of sudden onset of severe shortness of breath and sharp, persistent chest pain that radiates to her left arm. She reports experiencing these symptoms for approximately 2 hours prior to arrival. The patient also mentions feeling lightheaded and profuse sweating. She denies any history of trauma or recent travel.

Physical Examination Findings: Vital signs upon arrival reveal a heart rate of 130 bpm, blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on room air. Auscultation of the chest reveals decreased breath sounds and a systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border. The patient appears anxious and in distress.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's age, acute symptoms, and physical examination findings, an urgent evaluation for possible acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is warranted. EKG and cardiac enzymes will be ordered to further assess for myocardial infarction.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will receive oxygen supplementation via nasal cannula and will be started on a beta-blocker and nitrate for symptomatic relief and potential stabilization of the coronary arteries. A cardiology consultation has been requested, and the patient may require further interventions such as angiography or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the hospital for any changes in symptoms or vital signs. She will undergo additional testing as needed and will likely be admitted to the cardiac care unit for further management. A follow-up appointment with her primary care provider will be scheduled upon discharge from the hospital.
