History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient reported that his symptoms started gradually, with increasing difficulty in breathing during exertion and at rest.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
The patient's symptoms and physical findings suggest a possible exacerbation of COPD or congestive heart failure. Further investigations, such as chest X-ray, electrocardiogram (ECG), and laboratory tests, are recommended to confirm the diagnosis and assess the severity of the condition.

The patient will be started on a short course of oral corticosteroids and bronchodilators for potential COPD exacerbation. Diuretics may also be initiated if signs of congestive heart failure are confirmed. The patient should be closely monitored for any changes in symptoms or vital signs.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient is advised to return for a follow-up appointment within one week to assess the response to treatment and adjust medications as necessary.
