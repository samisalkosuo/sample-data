Chief Complaint: Acute shortness of breath and chest pain

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 48-year-old male, presented to the emergency department with complaints of sudden onset of severe shortness of breath and sharp, persistent chest pain that radiated to his left arm. He reported experiencing these symptoms while climbing stairs at home earlier today. The pain worsened over the past hour, accompanied by profuse sweating and lightheadedness. He denies any history of trauma or recent infections.

Physical Examination Findings: Vital signs revealed a heart rate of 120 bpm, blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on room air. Auscultation of the chest revealed diminished breath sounds and a systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border. The patient appeared anxious and diaphoretic.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the acute onset, severe symptoms, and physical examination findings, the patient is suspected to be experiencing an acute coronary syndrome (ACS), likely a myocardial infarction (MI).

Plan / Treatment: The patient was immediately started on aspirin, nitroglycerin, and oxygen therapy. An electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed, which showed ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads, confirming the diagnosis of an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The patient was transferred to the cardiac catheterization laboratory for urgent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the cardiac care unit post-procedure. A follow-up appointment with a cardiologist will be scheduled within one week for further management and risk factor modification recommendations. The patient was advised to avoid strenuous activities and to take prescribed medications as directed. He was also instructed to return immediately if symptoms worsen or new symptoms develop.
