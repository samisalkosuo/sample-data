Chief Complaint: Acute shortness of breath and chest pain

History of Present Illness (HPI): A 68-year-old female presented to the emergency department complaining of sudden onset of severe shortness of breath, accompanied by sharp, crushing chest pain that radiated to her left arm. The symptoms began approximately 2 hours ago while she was at home and have since worsened. She reports no associated symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, or diaphoresis. Her past medical history is significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and a remote history of myocardial infarction 10 years ago.

Physical Examination Findings: Vital signs revealed tachycardia (heart rate 120 bpm), tachypnea (respiratory rate 24 breaths/min), blood pressure 160/95 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 88% on room air. Pulmonary examination demonstrated bilateral crackles in the lower lung fields. Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular tachycardia with no murmurs or gallops.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's history, acute symptoms, and physical examination findings, this presentation is highly suggestive of an acute coronary syndrome, likely a non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).

Plan / Treatment: The patient was immediately started on aspirin, nitroglycerin, and morphine for pain relief. Oxygen therapy was initiated to improve oxygen saturation. An electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed, which showed ST-segment depression in the anterior leads, further supporting the diagnosis of NSTEMI. The patient was transferred urgently to the cardiac catheterization laboratory for potential percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the cardiac care unit post-procedure. A follow-up appointment with her primary care physician and cardiologist will be scheduled within one week to discuss further management, including medications, lifestyle modifications, and potential cardiac rehabilitation.
