Chief Complaint: Acute abdominal pain and vomiting

History of Present Illness (HPI): A 54-year-old female presented to the emergency department with a two-day history of progressively worsening, severe abdominal pain localized primarily in the lower right quadrant. The pain is constant, sharp, and associated with nausea and vomiting. She denies any history of trauma or recent surgery. Her symptoms are not relieved by antacids or rest.

Physical Examination Findings: Vital signs reveal a heart rate of 110 bpm, blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and temperature of 37.5°C (99.5°F). On abdominal examination, there is localized tenderness in the lower right quadrant with guarding and rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds are hypoactive.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of acute appendicitis is suspected. This condition requires urgent attention due to its potential for rapid progression and complications.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be admitted for further evaluation and management. Initial treatment includes intravenous fluids, pain medication, and antibiotics. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis will be ordered to confirm the diagnosis and assess for any complications. Surgical consultation has been requested due to the severity of symptoms.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the hospital. A surgical procedure, likely an appendectomy, may be performed if the CT scan confirms the diagnosis of acute appendicitis. Postoperative care and follow-up instructions will be provided upon discharge from the hospital.
