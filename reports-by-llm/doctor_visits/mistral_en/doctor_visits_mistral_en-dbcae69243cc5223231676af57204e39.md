Chief Complaint: Acute abdominal pain and vomiting

History of Present Illness (HPI): A 12-year-old male presented to the emergency department with a 6-hour history of progressively worsening, localized lower abdominal pain accompanied by repeated episodes of non-bloody vomiting. The patient also reported feeling lethargic and experiencing decreased appetite. No significant trauma or recent illnesses were reported prior to this episode.

Physical Examination Findings: Vital signs revealed a heart rate of 120 bpm, blood pressure of 90/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and temperature of 37.5°C (99.5°F). Abdominal examination showed localized tenderness in the lower left quadrant with guarding and rebound tenderness. No signs of peritonitis were observed.

Assessment / Diagnosis: The patient's symptoms, physical findings, and vital sign abnormalities suggest an acute appendicitis. This is a surgical emergency requiring prompt intervention due to the potential for rupture and subsequent peritonitis.

Plan / Treatment: The patient was immediately admitted for intravenous fluid resuscitation and pain management with morphine. Antibiotics were initiated to prevent possible infection. Surgical consultation was requested for an appendectomy.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the hospital's pediatric ward. A surgical procedure is planned within the next 24 hours, and postoperative care instructions will be provided upon discharge. Follow-up appointments with the general practitioner will be scheduled for wound check and recovery management.
