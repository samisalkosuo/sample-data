Chief Complaint: Acute respiratory distress and decreased level of consciousness

History of Present Illness (HPI): A 96-year-old male presented to the emergency department with a sudden onset of shortness of breath, cough, and confusion over the past 24 hours. The patient reported feeling increasingly weak and experiencing chest discomfort. He has a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

Physical Examination Findings: Upon arrival, the patient was visibly agitated and had a respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute with labored breathing. Oxygen saturation was 88% on room air. The patient's blood pressure was 160/90 mmHg, pulse rate was 120 beats per minute, and temperature was 37.5°C (99.5°F). Lung auscultation revealed decreased breath sounds bilaterally with crackles in the lower lung fields.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's age, comorbidities, and acute respiratory symptoms, a diagnosis of COPD exacerbation with possible pneumonia was considered. The patient's decreased level of consciousness may be due to hypoxemia or other underlying causes.

Plan / Treatment: The patient was immediately placed on high-flow oxygen therapy and started on intravenous antibiotics for suspected pneumonia. A chest X-ray was ordered to confirm the diagnosis and guide further management. The patient's blood glucose levels were closely monitored due to his history of diabetes mellitus.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the intensive care unit (ICU) for at least 48 hours. A follow-up appointment with the pulmonologist and internist will be scheduled upon discharge from the ICU to adjust medications, evaluate treatment response, and discuss long-term management strategies. The patient's family was educated on signs of respiratory distress and the importance of adhering to medication regimens.
