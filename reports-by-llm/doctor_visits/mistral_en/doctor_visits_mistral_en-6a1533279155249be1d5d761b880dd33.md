Severity Level: 4 (Less-urgent)
Patient Gender: Female
Patient Age: 58

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with a persistent cough and shortness of breath over the past week.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient reported that her symptoms began as a mild, non-productive cough which gradually worsened, accompanied by increasing shortness of breath, particularly upon exertion. She denied any chest pain, fever, or hemoptysis. The symptoms have not responded to over-the-counter cough suppressants and expectorants.

Physical Examination Findings:
Upon examination, the patient appeared comfortable but slightly tachypneic (respiratory rate 24 breaths/minute). Auscultation of the lungs revealed bibasilar crackles. The cardiovascular examination was unremarkable with a regular rhythm and normal blood pressure.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
The patient's symptoms are suggestive of an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

Plan / Treatment:
The patient will be started on a short course of oral corticosteroids and a bronchodilator inhaler. Antibiotics will not be initiated at this time, as the symptoms do not suggest a bacterial infection. The patient should return for a follow-up appointment in one week to assess response to treatment and adjust medications as necessary.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient is advised to continue using her inhalers as prescribed and to contact the clinic if her symptoms worsen or if she develops fever, chest pain, or hemoptysis. She should also schedule a follow-up appointment within one week for reevaluation. The patient was educated on the importance of smoking cessation and pulmonary rehabilitation in managing COPD.
