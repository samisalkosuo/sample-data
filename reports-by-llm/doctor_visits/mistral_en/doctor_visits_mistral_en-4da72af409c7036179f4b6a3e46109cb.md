Chief Complaint: Acute shortness of breath and chest pain

History of Present Illness (HPI): A 79-year-old female presented to the emergency department with a two-hour history of progressive shortness of breath, accompanied by severe chest pain radiating to her left arm. The patient reported feeling lightheaded and experiencing cold sweats. She has a background history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease.

Physical Examination Findings: Upon examination, the patient appeared distressed with a respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, blood pressure of 160/95 mmHg, and an oxygen saturation level of 88% on room air. Auscultation revealed bilateral crackles in the lung bases, and there was tenderness upon palpation of the left precordium.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's history, symptoms, and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of acute decompensated heart failure with possible acute coronary syndrome is suspected.

Plan / Treatment: The patient was immediately started on oxygen therapy, intravenous diuretics for fluid overload, and sublingual nitroglycerin for chest pain relief. An electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed, and the patient was prepared for urgent coronary angiography to evaluate for possible percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the intensive care unit (ICU) following the coronary angiography procedure. A follow-up appointment with her cardiologist will be scheduled within one week to discuss further management and optimize medications for her underlying conditions.
