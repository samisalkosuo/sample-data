Severity Level: 2 (Emergent)
Patient Gender: Male
Patient Age: 35

Chief Complaint:
Acute abdominal pain and vomiting

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient presented to the emergency department with a sudden onset of severe, constant abdominal pain localized primarily in the lower right quadrant. The pain began approximately 6 hours ago and has been accompanied by repeated episodes of non-bloody vomiting. The patient reports a fever of 38.5째C (101.3째F) and a general feeling of malaise. There is no history of trauma or recent travel, and the patient denies any changes in bowel habits or urinary symptoms.

Physical Examination Findings:
Vital signs: BP 140/90 mmHg, Pulse 105 bpm, Respirations 20 breaths per minute, Temperature 38.5째C (101.3째F). On abdominal examination, there is localized tenderness and guarding in the lower right quadrant with rebound tenderness. Rebound tenderness suggests possible peritonitis, which could indicate appendicitis or other intra-abdominal inflammatory processes.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
The patient's presentation is consistent with acute abdomen, specifically suspected appendicitis due to the location of pain, rebound tenderness, and fever. However, further diagnostic tests are necessary to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential causes of acute abdominal pain.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient will undergo an immediate ultrasound examination to evaluate for appendicitis. If the ultrasound is inconclusive or if there is a high suspicion of appendicitis, the patient may require a computed tomography (CT) scan with contrast. Intravenous fluids and pain management will be initiated as needed. Surgical consultation will be sought for possible appendectomy.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient will remain in the hospital for observation and further diagnostic tests. The surgical team will discuss the need for surgery and provide a detailed postoperative care plan. The patient should follow up with his primary care provider within one week following discharge from the hospital to discuss any ongoing symptoms or concerns.
