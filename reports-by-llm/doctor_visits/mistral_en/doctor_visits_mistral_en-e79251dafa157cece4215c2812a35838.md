 Visit Date: November 20, 2023
Clinic or Hospital Location: Kempele Health Center

Severity Level: 4 (Less-urgent)
Patient Gender: Male
Patient Age: 5 years old

Chief Complaint:
Recurrent cough and fever for the past three days.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient, a 5-year-old male, has been experiencing a persistent cough accompanied by low-grade fever for the past three days. The cough is non-productive and worsens at night. He also complains of mild fatigue and occasional headaches. There are no associated symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest pain, or vomiting.

Physical Examination Findings:
Upon examination, the patient appears slightly uncomfortable but cooperative. His temperature is 38.2°C (100.8°F), pulse rate is 105 beats per minute, respiratory rate is 24 breaths per minute, and blood pressure is within normal limits for his age. Lungs show occasional wheezing on auscultation, and the chest appears clear otherwise. The rest of the physical examination is unremarkable.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
The symptoms suggest a possible viral upper respiratory tract infection. However, given the persistent cough and occasional wheezing, a diagnosis of bronchitis cannot be entirely ruled out at this stage.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient will be prescribed an antitussive medication to alleviate his cough and a course of antibiotics to address any potential bacterial infection. Over-the-counter fever reducers may also be recommended for symptomatic relief. It is important to monitor the patient's symptoms and seek follow-up if they worsen or persist beyond the expected recovery period.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient should return for a follow-up visit in 5 days if symptoms improve, or sooner if they worsen. Parents are advised to ensure the patient rests adequately and maintains adequate fluid intake during recovery. If the fever persists or worsens, or if the patient develops shortness of breath or chest pain, immediate medical attention should be sought.
