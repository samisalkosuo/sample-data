Chief Complaint: Acute shortness of breath and chest pain

History of Present Illness (HPI): A 79-year-old female presented to the emergency department with a two-hour history of progressive shortness of breath, accompanied by sharp, retrosternal chest pain that radiates to her left arm. The patient reports feeling lightheaded and experiencing profuse sweating. She denies any recent trauma or exertional activity prior to symptom onset.

Physical Examination Findings: Vital signs reveal a heart rate of 130 bpm, blood pressure of 140/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on room air. Auscultation of the chest reveals diminished breath sounds and a systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border. The patient appears anxious and diaphoretic.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's age, acute symptoms, and physical examination findings, this presentation is highly suggestive of an acute coronary syndrome (ACS), most likely a myocardial infarction (MI).

Plan / Treatment: The patient was immediately started on aspirin, nitroglycerin, and oxygen therapy. An electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed, which showed ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads, confirming the diagnosis of an ST-elevation MI. The patient was transferred to the cardiac catheterization laboratory for urgent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the cardiac care unit post-procedure. A follow-up appointment with a cardiologist will be scheduled within one week for further management and risk factor modification. The patient was advised to maintain a low-sodium, heart-healthy diet, engage in regular exercise, and quit smoking if applicable. She was also prescribed aspirin, clopidogrel, atorvastatin, and metoprolol.

The patient was informed about the importance of follow-up appointments and adherence to medication regimen for optimal outcomes. She was advised to seek immediate medical attention if symptoms worsen or recur.
