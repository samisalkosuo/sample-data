Chief Complaint: Acute abdominal pain and shortness of breath

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 44-year-old female, presented to the emergency department with complaints of severe, constant abdominal pain that began approximately 6 hours ago. The pain is localized in the lower right quadrant and radiates to the back. Accompanying symptoms include nausea, vomiting, and shortness of breath. The patient reports feeling generally weak and has been unable to maintain oral intake for several hours.

Physical Examination Findings: Vital signs reveal a heart rate of 120 bpm, blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on room air. Abdominal examination reveals tenderness in the lower right quadrant with guarding and rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds are hypoactive. The patient appears pale and diaphoretic.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, and severity level 4 presentation, a diagnosis of acute appendicitis is suspected. The shortness of breath may be related to the patient's pain or could indicate a concurrent pulmonary issue.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be admitted for further evaluation and management. Initial treatment includes intravenous fluids, analgesia, and antibiotics. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis will be ordered to confirm the diagnosis and assess for any complications. If appendicitis is confirmed, surgical intervention will be necessary.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the hospital. A surgeon will discuss the planned procedure with the patient and provide further details regarding postoperative care. The patient should expect to remain in the hospital for several days following surgery. Follow-up appointments with the surgeon and primary care provider will be scheduled as needed.

It is essential that the patient informs her healthcare team of any changes in symptoms or concerns during her hospital stay.
