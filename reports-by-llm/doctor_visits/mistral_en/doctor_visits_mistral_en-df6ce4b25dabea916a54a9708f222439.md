Chief Complaint: Acute abdominal pain and vomiting

History of Present Illness (HPI): A 16-year-old female presented to the emergency department with a 6-hour history of severe, constant, and localized lower abdominal pain that radiated to her back. The pain was accompanied by repeated episodes of non-bloody vomiting. She also reported feeling feverish and experiencing chills. The patient denied any trauma or recent surgery.

Physical Examination Findings: Vital signs revealed a temperature of 38.5°C, pulse rate of 120 beats per minute, blood pressure of 90/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. Abdominal examination revealed tenderness in the lower left quadrant with guarding and rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds were hypoactive.

Assessment / Diagnosis: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest an acute appendicitis, a surgical emergency requiring urgent intervention due to the potential for rupture and peritonitis.

Plan / Treatment: The patient was immediately admitted for intravenous fluid resuscitation and broad-spectrum antibiotics. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis was ordered to confirm the diagnosis and assess for any complications. Surgical consultation was requested for possible appendectomy.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the hospital. Postoperative follow-up will be scheduled with the surgeon and primary care provider as appropriate. The patient should report any worsening of symptoms or fever to the healthcare team immediately.
