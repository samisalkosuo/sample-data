Chief Complaint: Acute abdominal pain and vomiting

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 30-year-old female, presented to the emergency department with a 6-hour history of severe, constant, and localized lower abdominal pain that radiated to her back. She also reported repeated episodes of non-bloody vomiting over the past 4 hours. The pain worsened with movement and was accompanied by fever (38.5°C) and leukocytosis (12,000 cells/mm³).

Physical Examination Findings: On examination, the patient appeared distressed but coherent. Abdominal examination revealed tenderness in the lower left quadrant with guarding and rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds were hypoactive. No signs of peritonitis were observed.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the acute onset, localized abdominal pain, fever, leukocytosis, and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of appendicitis is suspected. The severity level indicates an emergent situation due to the potential life threat.

Plan / Treatment: The patient was immediately admitted for intravenous fluid resuscitation, analgesia, and antibiotics. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis is planned to confirm the diagnosis and rule out any complications. Surgical consultation has been requested due to the severity of symptoms.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the hospital. Postoperative follow-up will be scheduled with the general surgeon, and a follow-up appointment with her primary care provider will be arranged within one week for continued management of her symptoms.
