Chief Complaint: Acute abdominal pain and shortness of breath

History of Present Illness (HPI): A 50-year-old male presented to the emergency department with a three-day history of progressively worsening epigastric abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. The patient also reported experiencing shortness of breath and chest tightness over the past day. He denies any trauma or recent changes in diet or medication regimen.

Physical Examination Findings: Vital signs revealed tachycardia (120 bpm) and hypertension (180/100 mmHg). On abdominal examination, the patient exhibited tenderness in the epigastric region with guarding and rebound tenderness. Auscultation of the abdomen revealed a positive Murphy's sign. Pulmonary examination revealed bilateral basilar crackles.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, and elevated white blood cell count (15,000 cells/mm3), the working diagnosis is acute appendicitis with possible peritonitis and concurrent pulmonary edema due to hypertension.

Plan / Treatment: The patient was immediately admitted for intravenous fluid resuscitation, broad-spectrum antibiotics (ceftriaxone and metronidazole), and analgesia (morphine). An urgent abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan was ordered to confirm the diagnosis and assess for any complications. The patient was also started on a diuretic regimen for pulmonary edema management.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the hospital's intensive care unit. A follow-up CT scan will be performed within 24 hours to assess the response to treatment and determine the need for surgical intervention. The patient will also undergo regular cardiac monitoring due to his hypertension. The patient's family is encouraged to ask questions and seek clarification regarding the treatment plan and prognosis.
