Chief Complaint: Acute abdominal pain and shortness of breath

History of Present Illness (HPI): A 37-year-old male presented to the emergency department with a two-day history of progressively worsening epigastric abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. The patient also reported experiencing dyspnea over the past few hours. He denied any chest pain, fever, or changes in bowel habits. The pain is sharp, constant, and radiates to his back. He appears anxious and is complaining of difficulty breathing.

Physical Examination Findings: Vital signs reveal a heart rate of 120 bpm, blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 93% on room air, and temperature of 37.5°C (99.5°F). On abdominal examination, there is tenderness in the epigastric region with guarding and rebound tenderness. Auscultation reveals decreased bowel sounds. The patient's respiratory exam shows increased respiratory effort, use of accessory muscles, and bilateral basilar crackles.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, and severity level, an acute abdomen with possible peritonitis secondary to a potential ruptured appendix or other intra-abdominal pathology is suspected. The shortness of breath may be due to diaphragm irritation from the abdominal process or a concurrent pulmonary etiology such as pleurisy or pneumonia.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be immediately admitted for further evaluation and management. Initial steps include intravenous fluid resuscitation, pain control, and oxygen supplementation. Laboratory tests including complete blood count (CBC), electrolytes, liver function tests (LFTs), coagulation profile, and lactic acid level will be ordered. An urgent abdominal CT scan with contrast is indicated to evaluate for possible appendicitis or other intra-abdominal pathology. If appendicitis is confirmed, the patient will require surgical intervention.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the hospital setting. A surgical consultation has been requested, and a surgeon will discuss further management options with the patient and family. The patient should expect frequent assessments of vital signs, pain levels, and abdominal symptoms. Follow-up appointments will be scheduled as needed based on the patient's progress and discharge plan.
