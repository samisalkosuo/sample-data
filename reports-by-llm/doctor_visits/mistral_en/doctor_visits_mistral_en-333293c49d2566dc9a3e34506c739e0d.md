Severity Level: 4 (Less-urgent)
Patient Gender: Female
Patient Age: 17

Chief Complaint:
Recurrent abdominal pain and nausea over the past week.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient, a 17-year-old female, presents with a one-week history of intermittent, localized abdominal pain, primarily in the lower right quadrant, accompanied by nausea and occasional vomiting. The symptoms have been worsening over the past few days, with increased frequency and intensity. She denies any associated fever, chills, or changes in bowel habits. There is no history of trauma, recent travel, or exposure to infectious diseases.

Physical Examination Findings:
Vital signs are within normal limits: Blood pressure 100/60 mmHg, pulse 85 bpm, respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, temperature 37째C (98.6째F). Abdominal examination reveals mild tenderness in the lower right quadrant with guarding but no rebound tenderness or rigidity. Bowel sounds are present and active.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
The patient's symptoms suggest possible appendicitis, although further investigation is needed to confirm the diagnosis.

Plan / Treatment:
Laboratory tests including complete blood count (CBC), electrolytes, and C-reactive protein (CRP) will be ordered. An abdominal ultrasound may also be performed to visualize the appendix. If appendicitis is confirmed, surgical consultation will be sought for possible appendectomy. In the meantime, the patient will be prescribed analgesics for pain management and antiemetics for nausea relief.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient should return to the clinic for lab results and ultrasound results within 24 hours. If symptoms worsen or if she develops a fever, she is advised to seek immediate medical attention. She will also be scheduled for a follow-up appointment with the surgeon if appendicitis is confirmed.
