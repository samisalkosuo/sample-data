Chief Complaint: Acute shortness of breath and chest pain

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 64-year-old female, presented to the emergency department with complaints of sudden onset of severe shortness of breath and sharp, persistent chest pain that radiated to her left arm. She reported experiencing these symptoms while climbing stairs at home earlier today. The pain worsened over the past hour, accompanied by profuse sweating and a feeling of anxiety. She has no known allergies or significant past medical history.

Physical Examination Findings: Upon arrival, the patient appeared anxious and was breathing rapidly with an oxygen saturation level of 88%. Her blood pressure was 160/95 mmHg, pulse rate was 120 beats per minute, and respiratory rate was 24 breaths per minute. Auscultation revealed a systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border, and her lungs exhibited bilateral crackles.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's acute symptoms, rapid onset, and physical examination findings, an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is suspected, most likely a myocardial infarction (MI).

Plan / Treatment: The patient was immediately started on aspirin, nitroglycerin, and morphine for pain relief. Oxygen therapy was initiated to improve her oxygen saturation levels. An electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed, which showed ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads, confirming the diagnosis of an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The patient was promptly transferred to the cardiac catheterization laboratory for urgent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

Follow-up Instructions: Post-procedure, the patient will be admitted to the coronary care unit (CCU) for close monitoring. A follow-up appointment with a cardiologist will be scheduled within one week to discuss further management and medication adjustments. The patient is advised to maintain a heart-healthy diet, engage in regular exercise, and avoid smoking. She should also take her prescribed medications as directed.

It is crucial that the patient returns for follow-up appointments and adheres to the recommended lifestyle changes to minimize the risk of recurrent cardiac events.
