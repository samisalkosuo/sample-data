Chief Complaint: Acute shortness of breath and chest pain

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 77-year-old female, presented to the emergency department with complaints of sudden onset of severe shortness of breath and sharp, persistent chest pain that radiates to her left arm. She reports experiencing these symptoms for approximately 2 hours prior to arrival. The patient also mentions feeling lightheaded and profusely sweating. She denies any history of trauma or recent travel.

Physical Examination Findings: Upon examination, the patient appears distressed with a respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg, pulse rate of 110 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation of 88% on room air. Auscultation reveals bilateral crackles in the lung bases, and there is tenderness upon palpation of the left chest wall.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's acute symptoms, tachypnea, tachycardia, and physical examination findings, a provisional diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) with possible myocardial infarction is suspected.

Plan / Treatment: The patient was immediately started on oxygen therapy at 6 L/min via nasal cannula. A 12-lead ECG was performed, which showed ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads, confirming the diagnosis of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The patient was promptly transferred to the cardiac catheterization laboratory for primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

Follow-up Instructions: Post-procedure, the patient will be admitted to the coronary care unit (CCU) for close monitoring. She will receive dual antiplatelet therapy and a statin for secondary prevention of cardiovascular events. A follow-up appointment with her cardiologist will be scheduled within one week for further management and risk factor modification. The patient is advised to maintain a heart-healthy diet, engage in regular exercise, and avoid smoking. She should also take her medications as prescribed and return for routine checkups as directed by her healthcare team.
