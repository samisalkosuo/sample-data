Chief Complaint: Acute shortness of breath and chest pain

History of Present Illness (HPI): A 62-year-old female presented to the emergency department complaining of sudden onset of severe shortness of breath and sharp, crushing chest pain that radiated to her left arm. The symptoms began approximately 3 hours prior to arrival and have worsened since then. She reports feeling lightheaded and experiencing cold sweats. The patient has no known allergies and denies any recent travel or exposure to sick contacts.

Physical Examination Findings: Vital signs upon arrival revealed a heart rate of 120 bpm, blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on room air. On auscultation, there was a systolic murmur heard loudest at the left lower sternal border. The patient appeared anxious and in distress.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, and age, an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is suspected. Further diagnostic tests are warranted to confirm the diagnosis and determine the extent of myocardial involvement.

Plan / Treatment: The patient was immediately started on aspirin, nitroglycerin, and a beta-blocker for symptomatic relief and to reduce myocardial oxygen demand. An electrocardiogram (ECG) and cardiac enzymes were ordered to aid in the diagnosis. In light of the severity of her symptoms, the patient was also given a loading dose of clopidogrel and will be transferred to the cardiac catheterization laboratory for urgent coronary angiography.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the cardiac care unit post-procedure. A follow-up appointment with her primary care physician will be scheduled within one week to discuss further management and medication adjustments as needed. The patient is advised to continue taking her prescribed medications as directed and to return immediately if symptoms worsen or new symptoms develop.
