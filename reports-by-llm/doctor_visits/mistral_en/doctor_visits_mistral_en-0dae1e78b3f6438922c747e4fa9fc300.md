Chief Complaint: Acute abdominal pain and shortness of breath

History of Present Illness (HPI): A 32-year-old female presented to the emergency department with a chief complaint of severe, constant abdominal pain that started abruptly 6 hours ago. The patient also reported difficulty breathing, with shortness of breath occurring over the past hour. She described the pain as sharp and localized in the lower right quadrant of her abdomen, accompanied by nausea and vomiting. The patient's vital signs upon arrival were: blood pressure 140/90 mmHg, pulse rate 120 beats per minute, respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute, temperature 38.5°C (101.3°F), and oxygen saturation 92% on room air.

Physical Examination Findings: On physical examination, the patient appeared distressed and in significant discomfort. Abdominal examination revealed localized tenderness and guarding in the lower right quadrant, with rebound tenderness present. Auscultation of the abdomen revealed hypoactive bowel sounds. The patient's lungs were clear to auscultation, but she was breathing rapidly and shallowly.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's acute onset of severe abdominal pain, localized tenderness, rebound tenderness, and hypoactive bowel sounds, a diagnosis of appendicitis is strongly suspected. The shortness of breath may be related to the patient's anxiety or could potentially indicate a complication such as peritonitis.

Plan / Treatment: The patient was immediately admitted to the hospital for further evaluation and management. Intravenous fluids were initiated, and broad-spectrum antibiotics were administered empirically to cover common appendicular pathogens. Pain management with intravenous opioids was also provided. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis was ordered to confirm the diagnosis and assess for any complications.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the hospital, and a surgical consultation has been requested for possible appendectomy. The patient should expect frequent vital sign checks, pain assessments, and potential further imaging studies. Follow-up appointments with the surgeon and primary care provider will be scheduled as appropriate.
