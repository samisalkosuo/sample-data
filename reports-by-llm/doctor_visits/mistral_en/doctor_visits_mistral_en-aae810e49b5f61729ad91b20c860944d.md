Chief Complaint: Acute shortness of breath and chest pain

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, an 84-year-old female, presented to the emergency department with a sudden onset of severe shortness of breath and sharp, persistent chest pain that radiated to her left arm. She reported experiencing these symptoms for approximately 2 hours prior to arrival. The patient also complained of lightheadedness, profuse sweating, and a feeling of anxiety. She has a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and coronary artery disease.

Physical Examination Findings: Upon examination, the patient appeared distressed with a respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, blood pressure of 160/95 mmHg, pulse rate of 110 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation of 88% on room air. Her heart rhythm was irregular, and there were crackles heard in the left lower lung field. The patient's EKG showed ST-segment elevation in leads V2-V4, suggestive of an acute myocardial infarction (MI).

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, and EKG results, a diagnosis of an acute anterior wall MI was made. The patient's condition is considered urgent due to the potential for life-threatening complications.

Plan / Treatment: The patient was immediately started on aspirin, clopidogrel, heparin, and nitroglycerin for pain relief and to reduce the risk of further cardiac events. Oxygen therapy was initiated to improve oxygen saturation levels. An urgent coronary angiography was ordered to assess the extent of the MI and determine appropriate intervention (e.g., percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass grafting).

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the cardiac care unit for any signs of hemodynamic instability, arrhythmias, or worsening chest pain. A follow-up appointment with her primary care physician and cardiologist will be scheduled within one week to discuss further management and long-term treatment options. The patient was advised to maintain a heart-healthy diet, engage in regular exercise, and adhere to her prescribed medications. She was also encouraged to attend cardiac rehabilitation as part of her recovery plan.
