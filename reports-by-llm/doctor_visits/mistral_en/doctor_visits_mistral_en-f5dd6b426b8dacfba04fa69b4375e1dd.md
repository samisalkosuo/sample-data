Clinic or Hospital Location: Kinnula Health Center

Severity Level: 3 (Urgent)
Patient Gender: Male
Patient Age: 78

Chief Complaint:
Acute shortness of breath and chest pain

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient presented to the emergency department complaining of sudden onset of severe chest pain, radiating to the left arm, accompanied by dyspnea. The symptoms began approximately 3 hours ago while the patient was at home. He reports no associated symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, or diaphoresis. The patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, for which he is currently on medication.

Physical Examination Findings:
Upon examination, the patient appeared anxious but cooperative. His blood pressure was 180/95 mmHg, pulse rate was 120 beats per minute, respiratory rate was 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation was 93% on room air. Auscultation of the heart revealed a regular tachycardia with a systolic murmur heard best at the left lower sternal border. Lung examination revealed bilateral basilar crackles.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
The patient's symptoms and physical findings are suggestive of an acute coronary syndrome, likely a non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).

Plan / Treatment:
The patient was immediately started on aspirin, nitroglycerin, and morphine for pain relief. Oxygen therapy was initiated to improve oxygen saturation. Electrocardiogram (ECG) and cardiac enzymes were ordered. The patient will be considered for urgent coronary angiography and potential percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient will be closely monitored in the coronary care unit. A follow-up ECG and cardiac enzyme levels will be repeated in 6 hours. The patient will be discussed with the cardiology team for further management and potential PCI. The patient's family has been informed of the situation and will remain involved in his care. The patient is advised to continue all medications as prescribed, especially his antihypertensive and lipid-lowering drugs. A follow-up appointment with the cardiologist will be scheduled upon discharge from the hospital.
