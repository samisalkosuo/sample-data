Chief Complaint: Acute abdominal pain and shortness of breath

History of Present Illness (HPI): A 55-year-old male presented to the emergency department with a three-hour history of severe, constant abdominal pain localized in the lower right quadrant. The patient also reported dyspnea, nausea, and vomiting. He denied any trauma or recent surgery but mentioned a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Physical Examination Findings: Vital signs revealed tachycardia (110 bpm) and mild hypotension (130/80 mmHg). Abdominal examination showed localized tenderness in the right lower quadrant with guarding and rebound tenderness. Auscultation of the abdomen revealed a positive McBurney's sign. The patient appeared anxious, and respiratory rate was elevated (24 breaths/min).

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the acute onset of lower right quadrant abdominal pain, tachycardia, hypotension, and positive physical examination findings, the patient is suspected to have an appendicitis. The shortness of breath may be related to the patient's underlying hypertension or could be a complication of the appendicitis.

Plan / Treatment: The patient was immediately admitted for intravenous fluid resuscitation and broad-spectrum antibiotics. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis was ordered to confirm the diagnosis and assess for any complications. Surgical consultation was requested for possible appendectomy.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the hospital. Postoperative follow-up will be scheduled with a general surgeon, as well as primary care physician for management of hypertension and diabetes mellitus. The patient should inform the healthcare team if symptoms worsen or persist after discharge.
