Severity Level: 5 (Non-urgent)
Patient Gender: Male
Patient Age: 95

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with a complaint of recurrent falls and dizziness over the past month.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient, an elderly gentleman, reported experiencing multiple episodes of sudden dizziness and loss of balance leading to falls in his home environment. He denied any head trauma or loss of consciousness during these incidents. The symptoms have been gradually worsening over the past month, with each episode becoming more frequent. He also mentioned a general weakness and difficulty walking for extended periods.

Physical Examination Findings:
Upon examination, the patient appeared frail but cooperative. His vital signs were stable, with a blood pressure of 140/80 mmHg, pulse rate of 95 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on room air. Neurological examination revealed no focal deficits, but the patient exhibited a mild ataxia and decreased balance.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
The patient's symptoms are suggestive of age-related vestibular dysfunction or orthostatic hypotension. However, further investigations are required to confirm the diagnosis and rule out any underlying causes such as medication side effects or cardiovascular conditions.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient will be referred for a comprehensive audiological and vestibular evaluation, including electronystagmography (ENG) and posturography. If orthostatic hypotension is suspected, a 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) will be ordered. The patient was advised to avoid rapid position changes and to rise slowly from seated or lying positions.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient should return for follow-up in two weeks after the results of the diagnostic tests are available. If symptoms worsen or if the patient experiences additional falls, he is instructed to seek immediate medical attention. The patient was also advised to maintain a healthy lifestyle, including regular exercise, a balanced diet, and adequate hydration.
