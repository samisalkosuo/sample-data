Chief Complaint: Acute abdominal pain and shortness of breath

History of Present Illness (HPI): A 31-year-old female presented to the emergency department with a chief complaint of severe, constant abdominal pain that began suddenly approximately 6 hours ago. The patient also reported experiencing shortness of breath, nausea, and vomiting. She denied any trauma or recent surgery but mentioned a history of irregular menstrual cycles.

Physical Examination Findings: Upon initial assessment, the patient appeared distressed with a heart rate of 120 beats per minute, blood pressure of 90/60 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute. Abdominal examination revealed tenderness in the lower right quadrant, guarding, and rebound tenderness. Auscultation of the abdomen revealed bowel sounds that were hypoactive. The patient's oxygen saturation was 93% on room air, and there were no signs of jaundice or edema.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the acute onset of severe abdominal pain, rebound tenderness, and guarding, a diagnosis of appendicitis is suspected. The shortness of breath, tachycardia, and hypotension may indicate peritonitis due to ruptured appendix.

Plan / Treatment: The patient was immediately admitted for intravenous fluid resuscitation, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and pain management. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis was ordered to confirm the diagnosis and assess for any complications such as perforation or abscess formation. Surgical consultation was requested for possible appendectomy.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the hospital's intensive care unit. A follow-up appointment with the general surgeon will be scheduled after discharge to discuss the surgical findings and postoperative care instructions. The patient is advised to return to the emergency department if symptoms worsen or if she experiences fever, increased abdominal pain, or persistent nausea and vomiting.
