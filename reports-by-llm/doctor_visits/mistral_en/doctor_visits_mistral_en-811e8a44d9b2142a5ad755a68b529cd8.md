Chief Complaint: Acute shortness of breath and chest pain

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 76-year-old male, presented to the emergency department with complaints of sudden onset of severe shortness of breath and sharp, persistent chest pain that radiates to his left arm. He reports experiencing these symptoms for approximately 2 hours prior to arrival. The patient also mentions feeling lightheaded and profuse sweating. He denies any recent trauma or exertional activity.

Physical Examination Findings: Upon initial assessment, the patient appears anxious and in distress. Vital signs reveal a heart rate of 130 bpm, blood pressure of 140/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 92% on room air, and temperature of 37.5°C (99.5°F). Pulmonary examination reveals bilateral crackles in the lower lung fields. Cardiovascular examination reveals a regular tachycardia with no murmurs or gallops.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's age, acute onset of symptoms, and physical findings, the working diagnosis is suspected to be an acute coronary syndrome (ACS), likely a myocardial infarction (MI).

Plan / Treatment: The patient was immediately started on oxygen therapy at 4 L/min via nasal cannula. A 12-lead ECG was obtained, which showed ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads, confirming the diagnosis of an ST-elevation MI (STEMI). The patient was promptly transferred to the cardiac catheterization laboratory for primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored during and following the PCI procedure. He is expected to remain in the hospital for several days for further management and monitoring. A follow-up appointment with his cardiologist will be scheduled upon discharge from the hospital. It is essential that he adheres to any prescribed medications, lifestyle modifications, and rehabilitation recommendations to reduce the risk of future cardiac events.
