History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 41-year-old female, presented to the emergency department with a 6-hour history of severe, constant abdominal pain localized primarily in the lower right quadrant. The pain radiates to the back and is accompanied by frequent vomiting. She reports no relief with over-the-counter pain medication. The patient denies any trauma or recent changes in her diet.

Physical Examination Findings: Vital signs show a heart rate of 110 bpm, blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and temperature of 37.8°C (99.94°F). On abdominal examination, there is localized tenderness in the lower right quadrant with guarding and rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds are hypoactive.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of acute appendicitis is suspected. The severity level is 2 (Emergent) due to the potential life threat posed by this condition.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be admitted for further evaluation and management. Immediate imaging with ultrasound or CT scan will be performed to confirm the diagnosis. If appendicitis is confirmed, surgical intervention will be necessary. Intravenous fluids and pain medication will be administered as needed.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be followed up by the surgical team post-operatively. A follow-up appointment with her primary care provider will be scheduled within 1 week for continued management of any post-surgical complications.
