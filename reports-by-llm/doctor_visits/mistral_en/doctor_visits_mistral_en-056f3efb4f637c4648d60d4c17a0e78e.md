Chief Complaint: Acute abdominal pain and vomiting

History of Present Illness (HPI): A 14-year-old male presented to the emergency department with a two-day history of progressively worsening abdominal pain, localized primarily in the lower right quadrant. The pain is constant, sharp, and associated with nausea and vomiting. He also reports fever, chills, and decreased appetite.

Physical Examination Findings: Vital signs revealed a temperature of 38.5°C (101.3°F), heart rate of 120 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and blood pressure of 110/70 mmHg. Abdominal examination demonstrated localized tenderness in the lower right quadrant with guarding and rebound tenderness. No signs of peritonitis were observed.

Assessment / Diagnosis: The patient's presentation suggests an acute appendicitis, a potential life threat (Severity 2). Further diagnostic imaging, such as ultrasound or CT scan, will be required to confirm the diagnosis and assess for any complications.

Plan / Treatment: Intravenous fluids will be initiated to address dehydration due to vomiting. Pain management with analgesics will also be provided. If the diagnosis of appendicitis is confirmed, surgical intervention will likely be necessary.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be admitted for further evaluation and management. A surgical consultation has been requested. The patient should remain NPO (nothing by mouth) until further instructions are given. Follow-up will be arranged with the surgical team and primary care provider as appropriate.
