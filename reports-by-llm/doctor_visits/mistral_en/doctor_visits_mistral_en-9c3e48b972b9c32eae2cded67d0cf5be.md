Severity Level: 2 (Emergent)
Patient Gender: Male
Patient Age: 64

Chief Complaint:
Acute shortness of breath and chest pain

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient presented to the emergency department with a sudden onset of severe chest pain, radiating to the left arm, accompanied by profuse sweating and dyspnea. The symptoms began approximately 3 hours prior to arrival and have since worsened. The patient reports a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, but denies any recent changes in medication or lifestyle.

Physical Examination Findings:
Upon examination, the patient appeared anxious and diaphoretic. Blood pressure was 180/100 mmHg, pulse rate was 120 beats per minute, respiratory rate was 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation was 92% on room air. Cardiac examination revealed an irregular heart rhythm with a systolic murmur heard best at the left lower sternal border. Lung auscultation revealed decreased breath sounds and crackles in the left lower lung field.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
The patient's symptoms, physical findings, and medical history are suggestive of an acute coronary syndrome, likely a myocardial infarction.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient was immediately started on aspirin, nitroglycerin, and morphine for pain relief and to reduce afterload. Oxygen therapy was initiated to improve oxygenation. Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads, confirming the diagnosis of a STEMI (ST-elevation myocardial infarction). The patient was transferred emergently to the cardiac catheterization laboratory for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient will be closely monitored in the cardiac care unit post-procedure. A follow-up appointment with a cardiologist will be scheduled within one week for further management and risk factor modification. The patient was advised to continue all prescribed medications as directed, maintain a heart-healthy diet, and engage in regular exercise. Lifestyle modifications such as smoking cessation and stress management were also emphasized.
