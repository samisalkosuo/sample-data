Chief Complaint: Acute Respiratory Distress and Septic Shock

History of Present Illness (HPI): A 103-year-old female presented to the emergency department with a sudden onset of shortness of breath, fever, and generalized weakness over the past 24 hours. The patient reported experiencing progressive dyspnea at rest, coughing up pinkish sputum, and feeling cold and clammy. She also mentioned having a history of chronic heart failure and diabetes mellitus.

Physical Examination Findings: Upon arrival, the patient appeared lethargic and tachypneic with a respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute. Her blood pressure was 85/60 mmHg, pulse rate was 120 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation was 88% on room air. Auscultation revealed bilateral crackles in the lung bases, a regular tachycardia, and a soft systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border. Her abdomen was distended with diffuse tenderness, and she had cool extremities.

Assessment / Diagnosis: The patient's presentation is consistent with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to septic shock due to a suspected pneumonia or sepsis. Given her advanced age, chronic heart failure, and diabetes mellitus, the patient's immune system may be compromised, making her more susceptible to infections.

Plan / Treatment: The patient was immediately started on broad-spectrum antibiotics, intravenous fluids for volume resuscitation, and supplemental oxygen via non-rebreather mask. A central venous catheter was inserted for continuous monitoring of central venous pressure and to administer vasopressors if needed. An electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed due to the presence of a murmur, and echocardiography was ordered to assess left ventricular function. Chest X-ray and blood cultures were also obtained to identify the causative organism.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the intensive care unit (ICU) for respiratory and hemodynamic stability. A multidisciplinary team, including pulmonologists, cardiologists, and infectious disease specialists, will collaborate on her management. The patient's family has been informed of the critical nature of her condition and the need for ongoing supportive care. Further updates will be provided as the situation evolves.
