Chief Complaint: Acute shortness of breath and chest pain

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, an 81-year-old male, presented to the emergency department with a sudden onset of severe shortness of breath and sharp, persistent chest pain that radiated to his left arm. He reported experiencing these symptoms for approximately 2 hours prior to arrival. The patient also complained of lightheadedness, profuse sweating, and a feeling of anxiety. He has a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease.

Physical Examination Findings: Upon examination, the patient appeared visibly distressed with a respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, blood pressure of 160/95 mmHg, pulse rate of 110 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation of 88% on room air. Auscultation revealed bilateral crackles in the lower lung fields, a systolic murmur at the left sternal border, and an irregular heart rhythm.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's symptoms, medical history, and physical examination findings, it is highly suspected that the patient is experiencing an acute coronary syndrome, most likely a myocardial infarction (heart attack). The patient's presentation falls under Severity Level 3 due to the need for multiple resources and the potential life-threatening nature of his symptoms.

Plan / Treatment: The patient was immediately started on oxygen therapy, aspirin, nitroglycerin, and morphine for pain relief. An electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed, which showed ST-segment elevation in the leads corresponding to the patient's symptoms. The patient was subsequently transferred to the cardiac catheterization laboratory for urgent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the cardiac care unit following the PCI procedure. He is expected to have a follow-up appointment with his cardiologist within one week to discuss further management and medication adjustments. The patient was also advised to attend cardiac rehabilitation as part of his long-term recovery plan.

It is essential that the patient's family or caregivers are aware of the serious nature of this event and the importance of adhering to the prescribed treatment regimen and follow-up appointments.
