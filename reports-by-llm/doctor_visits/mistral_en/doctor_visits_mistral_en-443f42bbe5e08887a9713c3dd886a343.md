Chief Complaint: Acute abdominal pain and vomiting

History of Present Illness (HPI): A 21-year-old female presented to the emergency department with a 6-hour history of severe, constant, and localized lower abdominal pain that radiates to her back. The pain is accompanied by repeated episodes of non-bloody vomiting. She reports no relief with over-the-counter pain medication and has not passed flatus or stool since the onset of symptoms. She denies fever, chills, or urinary symptoms.

Physical Examination Findings: Vital signs reveal tachycardia (heart rate 120 bpm) and mild hypotension (blood pressure 90/60 mmHg). Abdominal examination reveals tenderness in the lower quadrant, with rebound tenderness and guarding. Bowel sounds are hypoactive.

Assessment / Diagnosis: The patient's presentation suggests an acute appendicitis, a surgical emergency requiring prompt intervention due to the potential for perforation and subsequent peritonitis.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be admitted for intravenous fluid resuscitation and broad-spectrum antibiotics. Surgical consultation has been requested for possible appendectomy. Pain management will be provided as needed.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the hospital. A surgical consult will determine the timing of the procedure. Postoperative follow-up will be scheduled with the general surgeon and primary care provider.
