Chief Complaint: Acute abdominal pain and shortness of breath

History of Present Illness (HPI): A 46-year-old male presented to the emergency department with a 6-hour history of severe, constant abdominal pain localized to the lower right quadrant. The pain radiates to the back and is associated with nausea, vomiting, and decreased bowel movements. Additionally, he reports dyspnea on exertion for the past 2 days, which has worsened today. He denies any trauma or recent travel.

Physical Examination Findings: Vital signs reveal a heart rate of 110 bpm, blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on room air. On abdominal examination, there is localized tenderness in the right lower quadrant with guarding and rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds are hypoactive. The chest examination reveals bilateral basilar crackles.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of acute appendicitis with possible concurrent pleural effusion is suspected.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be admitted for further evaluation and management. Initial treatment includes intravenous fluids, analgesia, and antibiotics. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and chest will be ordered to confirm the diagnosis and assess for any complications. If appendicitis is confirmed, surgical intervention will be necessary.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be followed up by the surgical team tomorrow morning for further management decisions. He should continue taking prescribed medications as directed and inform the healthcare team of any changes in symptoms.
