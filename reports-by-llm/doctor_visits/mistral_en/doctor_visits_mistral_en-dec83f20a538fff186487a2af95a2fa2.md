Chief Complaint: Acute abdominal pain and shortness of breath

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 41-year-old female, presented to the emergency department with complaints of severe, constant abdominal pain that began suddenly over the past 6 hours. The pain is localized primarily in the lower right quadrant and radiates to the back. Accompanying symptoms include nausea, vomiting, and shortness of breath. The patient reports feeling lightheaded and experiencing a rapid heartbeat. She denies any history of trauma or recent travel.

Physical Examination Findings: Vital signs reveal a blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg, pulse rate of 120 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on room air. On abdominal examination, there is localized tenderness in the lower right quadrant with guarding and rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds are hypoactive. The patient appears distressed and diaphoretic.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the acute onset of severe abdominal pain, localized tenderness, and associated symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, shortness of breath, and tachycardia, the patient is suspected to have an appendicitis with possible peritonitis.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be admitted for immediate surgical consultation and potential appendectomy. Intravenous fluids will be initiated to address dehydration, and broad-spectrum antibiotics will be administered to prevent complications from possible peritonitis. Oxygen therapy will also be provided to manage shortness of breath.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the hospital for signs of improvement or deterioration. A follow-up appointment with the surgeon will be scheduled post-operatively to discuss recovery and any necessary post-surgical care. The patient is advised to contact the clinic if symptoms worsen or if she experiences fever, increased abdominal pain, or persistent nausea and vomiting prior to her follow-up appointment.
