Chief Complaint: Acute shortness of breath and chest pain

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, an 84-year-old male, presented to the emergency department with a sudden onset of severe shortness of breath and sharp, persistent chest pain that radiated to his left arm. He reported experiencing these symptoms while climbing stairs at home earlier today. The pain worsened over the past hour, accompanied by profuse sweating and lightheadedness. He denies any recent trauma or exertional activities prior to symptom onset.

Physical Examination Findings: Vital signs revealed a heart rate of 120 bpm, blood pressure of 140/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on room air. Auscultation of the chest revealed decreased breath sounds and a systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border. The patient appeared anxious and diaphoretic.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's age, acute symptoms, and physical examination findings, there is a high suspicion for an acute coronary syndrome (ACS), likely a myocardial infarction (MI).

Plan / Treatment: The patient was immediately started on aspirin, nitroglycerin, and oxygen therapy. An electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed, which showed ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads, confirming an ST-elevation MI (STEMI). The patient was transferred to the cardiac catheterization laboratory for urgent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored during and after the PCI procedure. He is expected to remain in the hospital for several days for further management and monitoring. A follow-up appointment with his cardiologist will be scheduled upon discharge, along with recommendations for lifestyle modifications and medications to reduce the risk of recurrent events.

It is crucial that the patient's family or caregivers are aware of the serious nature of this event and the importance of adhering to the recommended treatment plan and follow-up appointments.
