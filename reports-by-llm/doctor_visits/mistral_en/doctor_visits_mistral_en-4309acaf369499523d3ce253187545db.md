Chief Complaint: Acute abdominal pain and vomiting

History of Present Illness (HPI): A 34-year-old female presented to the emergency department with a two-day history of progressive, severe abdominal pain localized primarily in the lower right quadrant. The pain is constant, sharp, and associated with nausea and vomiting. She reports no relief with over-the-counter pain medication. There have been no bowel movements or urination for the past 12 hours. She denies fever, chills, or blood in her stool or vomit.

Physical Examination Findings: Vital signs reveal a heart rate of 110 bpm, blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and temperature of 37.5°C (99.5°F). Abdominal examination reveals tenderness in the lower right quadrant with guarding and rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds are hypoactive.

Assessment / Diagnosis: The patient's presentation suggests an acute appendicitis, a potential life threat (Severity 2) requiring prompt surgical intervention.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be admitted for further evaluation and management. Intravenous fluids will be initiated to correct dehydration. Pain management with intravenous opioids will also be provided. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis will be ordered to confirm the diagnosis.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be seen by a general surgeon for possible appendectomy. Postoperative care instructions will be provided upon discharge. The patient is advised to return if symptoms worsen or persist after discharge.
