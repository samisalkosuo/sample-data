Chief Complaint: Acute abdominal pain and vomiting

History of Present Illness (HPI): A 27-year-old female presented to the emergency department with a 6-hour history of severe, constant, localized lower abdominal pain that radiated to her back. The pain was accompanied by repeated episodes of non-bloody vomiting. She reported no relief with over-the-counter pain medication and denied any trauma or recent surgery.

Physical Examination Findings: Vital signs revealed a heart rate of 110 bpm, blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and temperature of 37.5°C (99.5°F). On abdominal examination, there was localized tenderness in the lower left quadrant with guarding and rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds were hypoactive.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a provisional diagnosis of acute appendicitis is suspected. The severity level is 2 (Emergent) due to the potential life threat posed by this condition.

Plan / Treatment: The patient was immediately admitted for further evaluation and management. Laboratory tests were ordered, including complete blood count, electrolytes, and inflammatory markers. An abdominal ultrasound is planned to confirm the diagnosis. If confirmed, the patient will undergo appendectomy.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the hospital. Postoperative follow-up will be scheduled with the general surgeon within 1 week after surgery. The patient should contact the clinic if symptoms worsen or persist before the scheduled follow-up appointment.
