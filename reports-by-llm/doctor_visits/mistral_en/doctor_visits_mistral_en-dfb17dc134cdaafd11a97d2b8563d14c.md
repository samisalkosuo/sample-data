Severity Level: 3 (Urgent)
Patient Gender: Male
Patient Age: 13

Chief Complaint:
Acute abdominal pain and vomiting

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient, a 13-year-old male, presented to the emergency department with complaints of severe, intermittent abdominal pain that began approximately 6 hours ago. The pain is localized primarily in the lower right quadrant and is accompanied by frequent vomiting. The patient reports no history of trauma or injury but mentions a mild fever (38.5°C) and decreased appetite over the past day.

Physical Examination Findings:
Upon examination, the patient appears uncomfortable but alert. Abdominal palpation elicits tenderness in the lower right quadrant with guarding present. Rebound tenderness is noted, and bowel sounds are hypoactive. No signs of peritonitis were observed. The rest of the physical exam was unremarkable.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
The patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest an acute appendicitis. This condition requires urgent surgical intervention to prevent potential rupture and complications.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient will be admitted for further evaluation, including laboratory tests (complete blood count, C-reactive protein, and urinalysis) and imaging studies (ultrasound or CT scan). Antiemetics will be administered to manage vomiting, and intravenous fluids will be initiated to maintain hydration.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient will be seen by a surgeon for potential appendectomy. The surgical team will discuss the procedure details with the patient and family. Postoperative care instructions will be provided upon discharge. Follow-up appointments will be scheduled as needed to monitor recovery progress.
