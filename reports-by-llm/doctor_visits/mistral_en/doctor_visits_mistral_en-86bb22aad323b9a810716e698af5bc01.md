Clinic or Hospital Location: Kruunupyy Health Center

Severity Level: 1 (Resuscitation â€“ immediate life threat)
Patient Gender: Male
Patient Age: 50

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with acute chest pain and shortness of breath, reporting symptoms as severe and persistent.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
Upon arrival, the patient reported experiencing sharp, crushing chest pain that radiated to his left arm for approximately 30 minutes prior to seeking medical attention. He also complained of profuse sweating, nausea, and shortness of breath. The symptoms began suddenly without any preceding events or known triggers.

Physical Examination Findings:
Upon initial assessment, the patient appeared anxious and in distress. Vital signs revealed tachycardia (heart rate 140 bpm), hypertension (blood pressure 200/120 mmHg), and respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute. The patient's oxygen saturation was 92% on room air, which prompted immediate supplemental oxygen administration. A cardiac examination revealed a regular tachycardia with a palpable precordial thrill. Lung auscultation revealed decreased breath sounds and crackles in the left lower lung field.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
The patient's presentation is highly suggestive of an acute coronary syndrome, most likely a myocardial infarction (MI). The rapid onset of severe chest pain, radiating to the left arm, accompanied by shortness of breath, nausea, and diaphoresis, along with abnormal vital signs and physical examination findings, support this diagnosis.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient was immediately transferred to the cardiac catheterization laboratory for urgent coronary angiography and potential percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Aspirin, clopidogrel, morphine, nitroglycerin, and oxygen were administered en route. Upon arrival at the cath lab, he was given a loading dose of a beta-blocker and anticoagulant.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient will be closely monitored in the cardiac care unit post-procedure. A follow-up appointment with a cardiologist will be scheduled within one week to discuss further management, including medications, lifestyle modifications, and potential rehabilitation. The patient is advised to avoid strenuous activities and maintain a heart-healthy diet during recovery.
