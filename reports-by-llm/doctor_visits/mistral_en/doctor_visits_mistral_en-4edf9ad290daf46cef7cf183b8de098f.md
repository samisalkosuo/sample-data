Clinic or Hospital Location: Lapua Health Center

Severity Level: 2 (Emergent)
Patient Gender: Female
Patient Age: 61

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with acute shortness of breath and chest pain.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient reported experiencing sharp, persistent chest pain for approximately 2 hours prior to arrival, accompanied by dyspnea and a feeling of pressure in the chest. The symptoms worsened with exertion and were associated with nausea and cold sweats. No known precipitating events or trauma were reported.

Physical Examination Findings:
Upon examination, the patient appeared anxious and was breathing rapidly. Her pulse was 120 beats per minute, blood pressure was 160/90 mmHg, respiratory rate was 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation was 93% on room air. Auscultation of the chest revealed a systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are suggestive of an acute coronary syndrome, likely a non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).

Plan / Treatment:
The patient was immediately started on aspirin, nitroglycerin, and morphine for pain relief. Oxygen therapy was initiated to improve oxygen saturation levels. An electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed, which showed ST-segment depression in the anterior leads, further supporting the diagnosis of NSTEMI. The patient was transferred to the cardiac catheterization laboratory for urgent coronary angiography and potential percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient will be closely monitored in the cardiac care unit post-procedure. A follow-up appointment with a cardiologist will be scheduled within one week to discuss further management, including medications, lifestyle modifications, and potential rehabilitation. The patient is advised to avoid strenuous activities and to seek immediate medical attention if symptoms worsen or recur.
