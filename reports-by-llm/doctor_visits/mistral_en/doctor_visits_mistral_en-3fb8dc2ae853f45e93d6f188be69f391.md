Chief Complaint: Acute abdominal pain and shortness of breath

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 49-year-old female, presented to the emergency department with complaints of severe, constant abdominal pain that began suddenly approximately 6 hours ago. The pain is localized primarily in the lower right quadrant and radiates to the back. Accompanying symptoms include nausea, vomiting, and shortness of breath. The patient reports feeling lightheaded and experiencing a rapid heartbeat.

Physical Examination Findings: Vital signs upon arrival revealed a blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg, pulse rate of 120 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, temperature of 37.5°C (99.5°F), and oxygen saturation of 92% on room air. Abdominal examination revealed localized tenderness in the lower right quadrant with guarding and rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds were hypoactive. The patient appeared anxious and diaphoretic.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the acute onset of severe abdominal pain, localized to the right lower quadrant, accompanied by nausea, vomiting, shortness of breath, tachycardia, and hypoactive bowel sounds, the patient is suspected to have an appendicitis. The shortness of breath may be due to a concurrent pulmonary embolism, which requires further investigation.

Plan / Treatment: The patient was immediately admitted for intravenous fluid resuscitation, pain management, and antibiotic therapy. A computed tomography (CT) scan with contrast was ordered to confirm the diagnosis of appendicitis and evaluate for any coexisting conditions such as a pulmonary embolism. If confirmed, surgical intervention will be necessary.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the hospital for any signs of worsening symptoms or complications. A follow-up appointment with the general surgeon will be scheduled to discuss further management options once the CT scan results are available. The patient is advised to continue taking prescribed medications as directed and to seek immediate medical attention if symptoms worsen or new symptoms develop.
