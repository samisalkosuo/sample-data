Chief Complaint: Acute shortness of breath and chest pain

History of Present Illness (HPI): A 90-year-old female presented to the emergency department with a sudden onset of severe shortness of breath, accompanied by sharp chest pain that radiated to her left arm. The symptoms began approximately three hours prior to arrival and have worsened since then. She reports feeling lightheaded and experiencing profuse sweating. The patient has a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease.

Physical Examination Findings: Upon examination, the patient appeared distressed with a respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, blood pressure of 160/95 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 88% on room air. Auscultation revealed bilateral crackles in the lung bases, an irregular heart rhythm, and a weak, rapid pulse.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's history, acute symptoms, and physical examination findings, it is suspected that she may be experiencing an acute coronary syndrome, possibly a myocardial infarction (MI).

Plan / Treatment: The patient was immediately started on oxygen therapy, aspirin, and nitroglycerin for potential MI. ECG and cardiac enzymes were ordered to confirm the diagnosis. Due to her critical condition, she was transferred to the cardiac catheterization laboratory for possible percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the cardiac care unit post-procedure. A follow-up appointment with her primary care physician and cardiologist is scheduled within one week to assess her progress, adjust medications, and discuss long-term management strategies for her underlying conditions.
