Chief Complaint: Acute abdominal pain and shortness of breath

History of Present Illness (HPI): A 37-year-old male presented to the emergency department with a 6-hour history of severe, constant abdominal pain localized in the lower right quadrant, accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and worsening shortness of breath. The patient reported no preceding trauma or recent changes in diet or medication regimen.

Physical Examination Findings: Vital signs revealed tachycardia (120 bpm) and hypotension (90/60 mmHg). Abdominal examination elicited localized tenderness, guarding, and rebound tenderness in the lower right quadrant. Respiratory examination showed decreased breath sounds on the right side with occasional wheezes.

Assessment / Diagnosis: The patient's presentation is consistent with an acute appendicitis complicated by a possible right lower lobe pneumonia, given the severity of symptoms and physical findings.

Plan / Treatment: The patient was immediately admitted to the hospital for intravenous fluid resuscitation, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and pain management. An urgent abdominal ultrasound is planned to confirm the diagnosis and guide further management.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the hospital's intensive care unit. A surgical consultation has been requested for possible appendectomy. The patient should expect frequent assessments of vital signs, pain levels, and abdominal symptoms. Follow-up appointments with the surgeon and primary care provider will be scheduled upon discharge from the hospital.
