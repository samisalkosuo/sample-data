Chief Complaint: Acute abdominal pain and shortness of breath

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 45-year-old female, presented to the emergency department with a sudden onset of severe abdominal pain localized in the lower right quadrant, accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and shortness of breath. The symptoms began approximately 6 hours ago and have since worsened. She reports feeling lightheaded and experiencing rapid heartbeat.

Physical Examination Findings: Vital signs revealed a blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg, pulse rate of 120 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on room air. Abdominal examination showed localized tenderness in the lower right quadrant with guarding and rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds were hypoactive.

Assessment / Diagnosis: The patient's presentation is consistent with an acute appendicitis, a surgical emergency. The shortness of breath may be due to the associated peritoneal irritation or possible concurrent pulmonary embolism, which requires further investigation.

Plan / Treatment: The patient was immediately admitted for intravenous fluid resuscitation and pain management. Laboratory tests were ordered, including complete blood count, electrolytes, liver function tests, and coagulation profile. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast was performed to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential causes for her symptoms.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the hospital for any signs of hemodynamic instability or worsening respiratory status. Surgical consultation has been requested, and the patient is expected to undergo an appendectomy within the next 24 hours. She should continue taking prescribed medications as directed and report any changes in symptoms to her healthcare team. A follow-up appointment will be scheduled upon discharge for wound care instructions and postoperative management.
