Chief Complaint: Acute asthmatic episode

History of Present Illness (HPI): An 8-year-old female patient presented to the emergency department with a sudden onset of shortness of breath, wheezing, and chest tightness. The symptoms began approximately three hours ago during physical activity at school. The patient reports increased respiratory rate, difficulty speaking in full sentences due to dyspnea, and intercostal retractions. She has a history of asthma, which is currently managed with inhaled corticosteroids and rescue bronchodilators.

Physical Examination Findings: Upon examination, the patient's vital signs were as follows: temperature 36.8°C (98.24°F), pulse rate 130 beats per minute, blood pressure 100/60 mmHg, respiratory rate 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 88% on room air. Auscultation of the chest revealed bilateral wheezing, particularly in the lower lung fields.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's history of asthma, acute exacerbation is suspected based on the sudden onset of symptoms and physical examination findings. The patient's oxygen saturation is below the normal range, indicating possible hypoxemia.

Plan / Treatment: The patient was immediately administered nebulized albuterol and ipratropium bromide for bronchodilation. Oxygen therapy was initiated to maintain oxygen saturation above 90%. A corticosteroid (e.g., prednisone) was prescribed for anti-inflammatory effects. The patient will be monitored closely in the emergency department until symptoms improve and oxygen saturation stabilizes.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient should follow up with her primary care provider within 24 hours for further management and adjustment of medications as needed. She is advised to use her rescue inhaler as prescribed and avoid triggers such as cold air, smoke, and allergens. A written asthma action plan will be provided to the patient and her parents. The patient should return to the emergency department if symptoms worsen or if she experiences any difficulty breathing.
