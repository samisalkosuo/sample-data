Chief Complaint: Acute shortness of breath and chest pain

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 70-year-old male, presented to the emergency department with complaints of sudden onset of severe shortness of breath and sharp, persistent chest pain that radiated to his left arm. He reported experiencing these symptoms while climbing stairs at home earlier today. The pain has since worsened, and he now describes it as a crushing sensation. Associated symptoms include profuse sweating, lightheadedness, and a feeling of anxiety.

Physical Examination Findings: Upon initial assessment, the patient appeared distressed with an elevated respiratory rate (24 breaths/min) and heart rate (130 beats/min). His blood pressure was 160/95 mmHg. Auscultation of the chest revealed diminished breath sounds on the left side, with a prominent pulmonary rate. There were no signs of peripheral edema or jugular venous distension.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's age, acute onset of symptoms, and physical examination findings, there is a high suspicion for an acute coronary syndrome, specifically a possible myocardial infarction (MI).

Plan / Treatment: The patient was immediately started on oxygen therapy and aspirin. A 12-lead ECG was performed, which showed ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads, confirming the diagnosis of an ST-elevation MI. The patient was promptly transferred to the cardiac catheterization laboratory for urgent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored during and after the PCI procedure. He is expected to remain in the hospital for several days for further management and monitoring. A follow-up appointment with his cardiologist will be scheduled upon discharge from the hospital.

It is essential that the patient adheres to all medication regimens, lifestyle modifications, and rehabilitation recommendations provided by his healthcare team to minimize the risk of future cardiac events.
