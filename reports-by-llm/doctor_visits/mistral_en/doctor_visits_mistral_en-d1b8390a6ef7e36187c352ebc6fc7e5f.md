History of Present Illness (HPI): A 59-year-old female presented to the emergency department with a two-day history of progressively worsening, severe abdominal pain localized in the lower right quadrant. The pain is constant, sharp, and radiates to the back. Accompanying symptoms include nausea, vomiting, and decreased appetite. Over the past 12 hours, she has also developed shortness of breath and a fever up to 38.5°C (101.3°F).

Physical Examination Findings: Vital signs revealed tachycardia (heart rate 110 bpm) and mild hypertension (blood pressure 160/95 mmHg). Abdominal examination showed localized tenderness, guarding, and rebound tenderness in the lower right quadrant. Bowel sounds were hypoactive. Respiratory examination revealed bilateral basilar crackles.

Assessment / Diagnosis: The patient's presentation is consistent with an acute appendicitis complicated by pleural effusion due to parapneumonic process.

Plan / Treatment: Intravenous antibiotics were initiated for the suspected appendicitis and possible concurrent pneumonia. Pain management with opioids was also provided. The patient was prepared for an urgent appendectomy, followed by chest imaging and potential thoracentesis if necessary.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be admitted to the hospital for close monitoring and surgical intervention. A follow-up appointment with the general surgeon will be scheduled post-operatively to discuss recovery plans.
