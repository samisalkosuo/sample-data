Chief Complaint: Dyspnea and generalized weakness in a nonagenarian female patient

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 101-year-old woman, presented to the emergency department with complaints of progressive dyspnea over the past week, accompanied by increasing generalized weakness. She reported experiencing orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, exacerbated by minimal physical activity. The patient also mentioned a persistent nonproductive cough and mild chest discomfort.

Physical Examination Findings: Upon examination, the patient appeared cachectic with a respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 88% on room air, and a blood pressure of 130/70 mmHg. Auscultation revealed bilateral crackles in the lower lung fields, and cardiac examination revealed a regular tachycardia with a rate of 120 beats per minute.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's age, symptoms, and physical findings, the most likely diagnosis is congestive heart failure exacerbation. The patient's advanced age and multiple comorbidities contribute to her current condition.

Plan / Treatment: The patient was immediately started on intravenous furosemide for diuresis, oxygen therapy to maintain saturation above 90%, and morphine sulfate for symptomatic relief of dyspnea. A chest X-ray and echocardiogram were ordered to further evaluate the heart function and pulmonary status.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be admitted to the hospital for close monitoring, optimization of medications, and management of symptoms. A follow-up appointment with the cardiologist will be scheduled within 24 hours of admission for further evaluation and adjustment of treatment plan as needed. The patient's family has been informed about the current situation and the expected course of action.

It is crucial to emphasize the importance of adhering to the prescribed medications, maintaining a low-sodium diet, and monitoring weight daily for fluid management. Regular follow-ups with the primary care physician are recommended to manage comorbidities and prevent future exacerbations.
