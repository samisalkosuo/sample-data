Chief Complaint: Acute shortness of breath and chest pain

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 60-year-old female, presented to the emergency department with complaints of sudden onset of severe chest pain radiating to her left arm, accompanied by dyspnea. She reported that the symptoms began approximately two hours ago while she was at home and worsened over time. The patient has no known allergies and denies any recent illnesses or injuries.

Physical Examination Findings: Upon arrival, the patient appeared anxious and in distress. Vital signs revealed a heart rate of 130 bpm, blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 92% on room air, and temperature of 37.5Â°C. Auscultation of the chest revealed decreased breath sounds and a systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's acute symptoms, elevated vital signs, and physical examination findings, an emergent diagnosis of possible acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is suspected.

Plan / Treatment: The patient was immediately started on aspirin, nitroglycerin, and morphine for pain relief and to reduce myocardial oxygen demand. Electrocardiogram (ECG) and cardiac enzymes were ordered to further evaluate the possibility of ACS. The patient was also given supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be transferred to the cardiac catheterization laboratory for urgent coronary angiography to confirm the diagnosis and determine appropriate treatment options. The patient's family has been informed of the situation, and they are encouraged to remain supportive during this critical time. Further updates will be provided as more information becomes available.

The patient will require close monitoring in the intensive care unit (ICU) post-procedure, and a follow-up appointment with her cardiologist will be scheduled upon discharge from the hospital.
