Clinic or Hospital Location: Humppila Health Center

Severity Level: 2 (Emergent)
Patient Gender: Male
Patient Age: 72

Chief Complaint:
Acute shortness of breath and chest pain

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient presented to the emergency department with a sudden onset of severe chest pain, radiating to the left arm, accompanied by profuse sweating and dyspnea. The symptoms began approximately 3 hours prior to arrival and have worsened since then. The patient denies any trauma or recent exertion. He has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, for which he is currently on medication.

Physical Examination Findings:
Upon examination, the patient appeared anxious and in distress. His blood pressure was 180/95 mmHg, pulse rate was 120 beats per minute, respiratory rate was 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation was 92% on room air. Auscultation of the heart revealed a regular tachycardia with an audible S4 gallop. Lung auscultation revealed bilateral crackles, suggestive of pulmonary edema.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with an acute coronary syndrome, likely a myocardial infarction. The presence of pulmonary edema suggests congestive heart failure as a complication.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient was immediately started on oxygen therapy and intravenous morphine for pain relief. A 12-lead ECG was performed, which showed ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads, confirming the diagnosis of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The patient was urgently transferred to the cardiac catheterization laboratory for primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). He will also receive aspirin, clopidogrel, and a beta-blocker for management of his acute coronary syndrome and heart failure.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient will be closely monitored in the cardiac care unit post-procedure. A follow-up appointment with the cardiologist will be scheduled within 1 week to discuss further management, including medications, lifestyle modifications, and potential coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) if indicated. The patient should also follow up with his primary care physician for ongoing management of his hypertension and hyperlipidemia.
