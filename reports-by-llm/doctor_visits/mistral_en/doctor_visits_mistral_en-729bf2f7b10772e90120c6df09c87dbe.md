Chief Complaint: Acute shortness of breath and chest pain

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 95-year-old male, presented to the emergency department with complaints of sudden onset of severe shortness of breath and sharp, persistent chest pain that radiated to his left arm. He reported experiencing these symptoms for approximately 2 hours prior to arrival. The patient also mentioned feeling lightheaded and profusely sweating. He has a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease.

Physical Examination Findings: Upon examination, the patient appeared anxious and in distress. His blood pressure was 180/95 mmHg, pulse rate was 120 beats per minute, respiratory rate was 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation was 88% on room air. Auscultation of the heart revealed a regular tachycardia with a systolic murmur heard best at the left lower sternal border. Lung auscultation demonstrated bilateral crackles.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's age, medical history, and acute symptoms, there is a high suspicion for an acute coronary syndrome, most likely a myocardial infarction (MI). The presence of chest pain radiating to the left arm, shortness of breath, tachycardia, systolic murmur, and bilateral crackles on lung auscultation support this diagnosis.

Plan / Treatment: The patient was immediately started on aspirin, nitroglycerin, and morphine for pain relief and to reduce afterload. Oxygen therapy was initiated to improve oxygen saturation. An electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed, which showed ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads, confirming the diagnosis of an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The patient was promptly transferred to the cardiac catheterization laboratory for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the cardiac care unit following PCI. He is expected to have a prolonged hospital stay for further management and monitoring of his cardiac status. A follow-up appointment with his primary care physician will be scheduled upon discharge from the hospital, along with recommendations for cardiac rehabilitation and lifestyle modifications.

It is crucial that the patient's family members are informed about the patient's condition, treatment plan, and recovery process. They should also be prepared to assist with any necessary follow-up care and support during the patient's recovery.
