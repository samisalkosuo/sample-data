Chief Complaint: Acute abdominal pain and shortness of breath

History of Present Illness (HPI): A 43-year-old female presented to the emergency department with a 6-hour history of severe, constant abdominal pain localized to the lower right quadrant. The pain radiates to the back and is accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and shortness of breath. She reports feeling lightheaded and experiencing chills. The patient denies any trauma or recent travel but admits to a history of irregular menstrual cycles and occasional mild abdominal discomfort.

Physical Examination Findings: Vital signs reveal tachycardia (120 bpm) and hypotension (90/60 mmHg). Abdominal examination reveals localized tenderness in the lower right quadrant with guarding and rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds are diminished, and there is no palpable mass. Respiratory examination shows bilateral basilar crackles.

Assessment / Diagnosis: The patient's presentation suggests an acute appendicitis complicated by pleural effusion due to the associated shortness of breath and respiratory findings.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be admitted for intravenous fluid resuscitation, pain management, and antibiotic therapy. A computed tomography (CT) scan with contrast will be ordered to confirm the diagnosis and evaluate for any complications. If the diagnosis is confirmed, an appendectomy will be performed.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be followed up by the surgical team daily during hospitalization. Postoperative follow-up will be scheduled as needed. The patient should seek immediate attention if symptoms worsen or if fever develops.
