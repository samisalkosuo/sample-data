Chief Complaint: Acute shortness of breath and chest pain

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 83-year-old female, presented to the emergency department with complaints of sudden onset of severe shortness of breath and sharp, persistent chest pain that radiates to her left arm. She reports experiencing these symptoms for approximately 2 hours prior to arrival. The patient also mentions feeling lightheaded and profusely sweating. She has a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, and coronary artery disease.

Physical Examination Findings: Upon examination, the patient appears anxious and in distress. Her blood pressure is 180/95 mmHg, pulse rate is 120 beats per minute, respiratory rate is 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 93% on room air. Auscultation of the heart reveals a regular tachycardia with an audible S4 gallop. Lungs are bilaterally dull to percussion and have decreased breath sounds, particularly in the left base.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's history, acute symptoms, and physical examination findings, it is suspected that she may be experiencing an acute coronary syndrome (ACS), possibly a myocardial infarction (MI).

Plan / Treatment: The patient was immediately started on oxygen therapy at 4 L/min via nasal cannula. A 12-lead ECG was obtained, which showed ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads, confirming the diagnosis of an ST-elevation MI (STEMI). The patient was promptly transferred to the cardiac catheterization laboratory for urgent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent placement. She will also receive aspirin, clopidogrel, heparin, and a beta-blocker for management of her acute symptoms and ongoing ischemia.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the cardiac care unit post-procedure. A follow-up appointment with her primary care physician will be scheduled within one week to discuss further management, including medications, lifestyle modifications, and rehabilitation recommendations. She is advised to return immediately if symptoms worsen or recur.
