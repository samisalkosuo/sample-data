Assessment / Diagnosis:
The patient's presentation suggests an acute appendicitis, a potentially life-threatening condition requiring prompt medical attention.

Plan / Treatment:

An abdominal ultrasound or CT scan may also be performed to confirm the diagnosis. The patient is to receive intravenous fluids and pain medication as needed.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient will be closely monitored in the hospital for signs of complications such as perforation or sepsis. Surgical consultation will be sought, and an appendectomy may be performed if the diagnosis is confirmed. The patient should follow up with his primary care physician within one week following discharge to discuss post-operative care and recovery plans.
