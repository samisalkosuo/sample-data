Chief Complaint: Acute shortness of breath and chest pain

History of Present Illness (HPI): A 71-year-old female presented to the emergency department with a two-hour history of progressive shortness of breath, accompanied by sharp, retrosternal chest pain that radiates to her left arm. The patient reports feeling lightheaded and experiencing profuse sweating. She denies any recent trauma or exertion prior to symptom onset. Her past medical history is significant for hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and a previous myocardial infarction five years ago.

Physical Examination Findings: Vital signs reveal a blood pressure of 160/95 mmHg, pulse rate of 120 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 88% on room air. The patient appears anxious and in distress. On cardiovascular examination, there is a regular tachycardia with a palpable apical impulse. Auscultation reveals an S4 gallop and crackles at the base of both lungs.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's history, symptoms, and physical examination findings, the working diagnosis is acute decompensated heart failure with possible concomitant myocardial ischemia.

Plan / Treatment: The patient was immediately started on oxygen therapy at 4 L/min via nasal cannula. Intravenous furosemide and nitroglycerin were administered for acute heart failure management, and aspirin was given to reduce the risk of further ischemic events. Electrocardiogram (ECG) and chest X-ray were ordered for further evaluation.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be admitted to the cardiac care unit for close monitoring and further management. A follow-up ECHO will be scheduled within 24 hours, and a cardiology consultation will be arranged. The patient is advised to continue taking her prescribed medications as directed by her primary care physician.
