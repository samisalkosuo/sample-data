Chief Complaint: Acute shortness of breath and chest pain

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 58-year-old male, presented to the emergency department with complaints of sudden onset of severe chest pain radiating to his left arm accompanied by profuse sweating and dyspnea. The symptoms began approximately 2 hours ago while he was at home. He denies any preceding trauma or recent illnesses.

Physical Examination Findings: Upon arrival, the patient appeared anxious and in distress. His blood pressure was 160/95 mmHg, pulse rate was 130 beats per minute, respiratory rate was 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation was 88% on room air. Auscultation of the chest revealed decreased breath sounds and a systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, and age, an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is highly suspected. The patient's presentation falls under Severity Level 3 due to the presence of stable but significant hemodynamic instability.

Plan / Treatment: The patient was immediately started on oxygen therapy at 6 L/min via nasal cannula, and intravenous access was established for fluid resuscitation and administration of medications. A 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed, which showed ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads, confirming a diagnosis of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The patient was transferred urgently to the cardiac catheterization laboratory for primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the cardiac care unit post-procedure. A follow-up appointment with a cardiologist will be scheduled within one week for further management and risk factor modification. The patient was advised to continue taking prescribed medications as directed, maintain a heart-healthy diet, and engage in regular exercise. He was also instructed to return immediately if any recurrence of chest pain or worsening shortness of breath occurs.
