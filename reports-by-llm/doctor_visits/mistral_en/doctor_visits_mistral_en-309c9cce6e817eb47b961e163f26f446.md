Clinic or Hospital Location: Inkoo Health Center

Severity Level: 2 (Emergent)
Patient Gender: Male
Patient Age: 60

Chief Complaint:
Acute shortness of breath and chest pain

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient presented to the emergency department with a sudden onset of severe chest pain, radiating to the left arm, accompanied by profuse sweating and dyspnea. The symptoms began approximately 3 hours prior to arrival and have since worsened. The patient denies any preceding trauma or recent exertion.

Physical Examination Findings:
Upon initial assessment, the patient appeared anxious and in distress. Vital signs revealed a heart rate of 120 bpm, blood pressure of 160/95 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 88% on room air. Auscultation of the chest revealed diminished breath sounds in the left lung base with a systolic murmur heard at the apex.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are suggestive of an acute coronary syndrome, most likely a myocardial infarction (MI). The elevated troponin levels confirmed the diagnosis.

Plan / Treatment:
Upon arrival, the patient was administered aspirin, nitroglycerin, and morphine for pain relief. Oxygen therapy was initiated to improve oxygen saturation. An electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed ST-segment elevation in the leads V1-V6, consistent with an anterior MI. The patient was subsequently transferred to the cardiac catheterization laboratory for urgent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient will be closely monitored in the cardiac care unit post-procedure. A follow-up appointment with a cardiologist will be scheduled within one week for further management and risk factor modification. The patient is advised to maintain a low-sodium, low-fat diet, engage in regular exercise, and avoid smoking. He should also take prescribed medications as directed.

It is crucial that the patient returns for follow-up appointments and adheres to the recommended lifestyle changes to minimize the risk of recurrent events.
