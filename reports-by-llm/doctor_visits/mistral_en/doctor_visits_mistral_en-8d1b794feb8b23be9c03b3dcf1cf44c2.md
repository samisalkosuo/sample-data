Chief Complaint: Acute abdominal pain and vomiting in a 9-year-old female patient

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient presented with a 6-hour history of severe, intermittent abdominal pain localized to the lower right quadrant. The pain is sharp in nature and associated with frequent vomiting, nausea, and decreased appetite. No history of trauma or injury was reported. The symptoms started suddenly without any preceding illness or known triggers.

Physical Examination Findings: Vital signs revealed a heart rate of 120 beats per minute, blood pressure of 90/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and temperature of 37.5°C (99.5°F). On abdominal examination, there was localized tenderness and guarding in the lower right quadrant with rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds were hypoactive. No signs of distension or hepatosplenomegaly were observed.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the acute onset, localized abdominal pain, and associated symptoms, a diagnosis of appendicitis is suspected. The patient's vital signs indicate mild hypotension, which may be due to dehydration from vomiting.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be admitted for further evaluation and management. Initial treatment includes intravenous fluid resuscitation, analgesia, and antibiotics. An ultrasound examination of the abdomen will be performed to confirm the diagnosis and determine the appendix's size and position. If the diagnosis is confirmed, an appendectomy will be considered.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the hospital for any signs of complications. A follow-up appointment will be scheduled with the pediatric surgeon to discuss further management plans after the initial evaluation and treatment. The patient's parents are advised to seek immediate medical attention if the symptoms worsen or new symptoms develop.
