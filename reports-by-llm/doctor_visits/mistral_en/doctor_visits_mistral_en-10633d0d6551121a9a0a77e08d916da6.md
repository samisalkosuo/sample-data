Chief Complaint: Acute abdominal pain and shortness of breath

History of Present Illness (HPI): A 54-year-old female presented to the emergency department with a chief complaint of severe, persistent abdominal pain that began suddenly over the past 6 hours. The patient also reported experiencing dyspnea, or shortness of breath, over the same timeframe. She described the abdominal pain as sharp and localized in the lower left quadrant, accompanied by nausea and vomiting. The pain has been exacerbated by movement and deep breathing.

Physical Examination Findings: Upon initial assessment, the patient appeared distressed with a heart rate of 120 beats per minute and a blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg. Abdominal examination revealed localized tenderness in the lower left quadrant, with guarding and rebound tenderness. Auscultation of the abdomen revealed hypoactive bowel sounds. The patient's respiratory rate was 22 breaths per minute, and auscultation of the lungs revealed bilateral basilar crackles, suggesting possible pleural effusion.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, and the severity level, an urgent diagnosis of potential appendicitis with possible associated pleural effusion is suspected.

Plan / Treatment: The patient was immediately admitted to the hospital for further evaluation and management. Initial treatment includes intravenous fluid resuscitation, pain management, and antibiotics to cover common appendicular pathogens. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast will be performed to confirm the diagnosis and assess for any complications such as perforation or abscess formation. If the CT confirms appendicitis, surgical intervention will be necessary.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the hospital. A surgical consultation has been requested, and the patient will undergo a CT scan within the next 2 hours. The patient's condition will be reassessed after the CT scan results are available, and further management decisions will be made at that time. The patient should inform her primary care provider of this admission upon discharge.
