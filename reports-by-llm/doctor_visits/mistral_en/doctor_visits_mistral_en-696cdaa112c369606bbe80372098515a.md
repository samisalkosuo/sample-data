Chief Complaint: Acute abdominal pain and vomiting

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 13-year-old male, presented to the emergency department with a 6-hour history of progressively worsening abdominal pain localized primarily in the lower right quadrant. The pain is described as sharp and constant, accompanied by multiple episodes of non-bloody vomiting. He also reports fever (39Â°C) and decreased appetite over the past day.

Physical Examination Findings: On examination, the patient appears uncomfortable but alert. Abdominal exam reveals localized tenderness and guarding in the lower right quadrant with rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds are hypoactive. No signs of peritonitis were observed.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the acute onset, localized abdominal pain, fever, and rebound tenderness, the patient is suspected to have appendicitis, a surgical emergency requiring prompt intervention due to its potential for rupture and subsequent peritonitis.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be admitted for further evaluation and management. Initial treatment includes intravenous fluids, pain medication, and antibiotics to prevent possible infection spread. An urgent ultrasound or CT scan will be performed to confirm the diagnosis and assess the appendix's status. Surgical consultation has been requested for potential appendectomy.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the hospital. A surgical team will discuss the operative plan with the family, and a follow-up appointment will be scheduled post-surgery to assess recovery progress.
