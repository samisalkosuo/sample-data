Clinic or Hospital Location: Kivijärvi Health Center

Severity Level: 1 (Resuscitation – immediate life threat)
Patient Gender: Male
Patient Age: 40

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with complaints of sudden onset chest pain, shortness of breath, and profuse sweating.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
Upon arrival, the patient reported experiencing severe chest pain that radiated to his left arm for approximately 30 minutes prior to seeking medical attention. He also described feeling a tightness in his chest accompanied by shortness of breath and profuse sweating. The symptoms began abruptly without any preceding events or known triggers.

Physical Examination Findings:
Upon initial assessment, the patient appeared anxious and distressed. His blood pressure was 180/120 mmHg, pulse rate was 140 beats per minute, and respiratory rate was 26 breaths per minute. Auscultation of the heart revealed an irregular rhythm with a systolic murmur heard best at the left lower sternal border. The patient's oxygen saturation was 93% on room air.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
Given the acute onset, severe symptoms, and physical examination findings, the patient is suspected to be experiencing an acute coronary syndrome, most likely a myocardial infarction (heart attack).

Plan / Treatment:
The patient was immediately transferred to the emergency department for further evaluation and management. Upon arrival, he received aspirin, nitroglycerin, and morphine for pain relief. An electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed, which showed ST-segment elevation in multiple leads, confirming the diagnosis of a STEMI (ST-elevation myocardial infarction). The patient was subsequently taken for urgent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to reopen the blocked coronary artery.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient will be closely monitored in the intensive care unit following the PCI procedure. He is expected to remain hospitalized for several days for further management and recovery. The patient's cardiologist will discuss discharge plans, including medications, lifestyle modifications, and follow-up appointments with a cardiac rehabilitation specialist.
