Chief Complaint: Acute shortness of breath and chest pain

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 42-year-old male, presented to the emergency department with complaints of sudden onset of severe chest pain radiating to his left arm accompanied by profuse sweating and dyspnea. He reported experiencing these symptoms while climbing stairs at home approximately two hours ago. The pain is described as a crushing sensation that worsens with deep breaths.

Physical Examination Findings: Upon initial assessment, the patient appeared anxious and diaphoretic. Vital signs revealed tachycardia (140 bpm) and hypotension (90/60 mmHg). Respiratory rate was 28 breaths per minute with an oxygen saturation of 92% on room air. Auscultation of the heart revealed a regular rhythm, but with a prominent S4 gallop. Lung auscultation revealed bilateral crackles.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is suspected, likely a myocardial infarction due to the presence of chest pain, shortness of breath, and EKG changes.

Plan / Treatment: The patient was immediately started on aspirin, nitroglycerin, and morphine for pain relief. Oxygen therapy was initiated to improve oxygen saturation levels. An electrocardiogram (EKG) was performed, which showed ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads, confirming the diagnosis of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The patient was transferred emergently to the cardiac catheterization laboratory for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the cardiac care unit post-procedure. A follow-up appointment with a cardiologist will be scheduled within one week for further management and risk factor modification. The patient was advised to maintain a low-sodium, low-fat diet, engage in regular exercise, and avoid smoking. He was also prescribed aspirin, clopidogrel, atorvastatin, and beta-blockers for long-term management of his condition.

The patient was informed about the importance of seeking immediate medical attention if symptoms recur or worsen. He was also provided with educational materials on heart disease prevention and lifestyle modifications.
