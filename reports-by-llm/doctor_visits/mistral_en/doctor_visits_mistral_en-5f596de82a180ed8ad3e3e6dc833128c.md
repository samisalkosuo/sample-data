Severity Level: 3 (Urgent)
Patient Gender: Male
Patient Age: 13

Chief Complaint:
Acute abdominal pain and vomiting

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient, a 13-year-old male, presented to the emergency department with complaints of severe, intermittent abdominal pain that began approximately 6 hours ago. The pain is localized primarily in the lower right quadrant and is accompanied by frequent vomiting. The patient reports no history of trauma or injury but mentions a recent increase in consumption of spicy foods. He denies any fever, chills, or changes in bowel movements.

Physical Examination Findings:
Upon examination, the patient appears uncomfortable but alert. Abdominal examination reveals localized tenderness and guarding in the lower right quadrant, with rebound tenderness noted on deep palpation. Bowel sounds are present but decreased. No signs of peritonitis were observed.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
The patient's symptoms and physical findings suggest an acute appendicitis. This is a surgical emergency requiring prompt intervention to prevent complications such as rupture or perforation.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient will be admitted for further evaluation, including laboratory tests (complete blood count, electrolytes, and inflammatory markers) and imaging studies (ultrasound or CT scan). If the diagnosis is confirmed, the patient will undergo an appendectomy. Pain management and intravenous fluids will be initiated in the emergency department.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient will be closely monitored postoperatively. A follow-up appointment with the surgeon will be scheduled for wound check and pain management adjustments. The patient should avoid strenuous activities until fully recovered, which may take several weeks. A prescription for pain medication and antibiotics will be provided. If symptoms worsen or return before the follow-up appointment, the patient is advised to seek immediate medical attention.
