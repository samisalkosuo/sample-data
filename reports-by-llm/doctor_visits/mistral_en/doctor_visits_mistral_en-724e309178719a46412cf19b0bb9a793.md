Severity Level: 3 (Urgent)
Patient Gender: Male
Patient Age: 7 years old

Chief Complaint:
Acute abdominal pain and vomiting

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient, a 7-year-old male, presented to the emergency department with complaints of severe abdominal pain that began approximately 6 hours ago. The pain is localized primarily in the lower right quadrant of the abdomen and is accompanied by frequent vomiting. The patient also reports feeling lethargic and experiencing feverish sensations.

Physical Examination Findings:
Upon examination, the patient appears uncomfortable but cooperative. Abdominal palpation elicits tenderness in the lower right quadrant, with guarding and rebound tenderness noted. Bowel sounds are hypoactive, and there is no signs of distension. The patient's temperature is 38.5°C (101.3°F), pulse rate is 120 beats per minute, respiratory rate is 24 breaths per minute, and blood pressure is 90/60 mmHg.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest an acute appendicitis. This is a surgical emergency due to the risk of appendiceal rupture and potential peritonitis.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient will be admitted for further evaluation, including laboratory tests (complete blood count, electrolytes, and inflammatory markers) and imaging studies (ultrasound or CT scan). Antiemetics will be administered to manage vomiting, and intravenous fluids will be initiated to maintain hydration. Pain management will also be provided as needed.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient will be closely monitored in the hospital for signs of appendiceal rupture or complications. A surgical consultation has been requested, and the patient is expected to undergo an appendectomy within 24 hours of admission. The patient's parents have been informed of the situation and will be kept updated on the progress. Follow-up appointments will be scheduled post-surgery for wound care and recovery management.
