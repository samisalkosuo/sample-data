Chief Complaint: Acute abdominal pain and vomiting

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 46-year-old female, presented to the emergency department with a two-day history of progressive, severe abdominal pain localized primarily in the lower right quadrant. The pain is constant, sharp, and associated with nausea and vomiting. She reports no relief with over-the-counter pain medication. She denies fever, chills, or changes in bowel habits but has noticed a decrease in appetite.

Physical Examination Findings: Vital signs reveal a heart rate of 110 bpm, blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and temperature of 37.5°C (99.5°F). Abdominal examination reveals localized tenderness in the lower right quadrant with guarding and rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds are hypoactive.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, and severity level 2 presentation, a diagnosis of acute appendicitis is suspected.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be admitted for further evaluation and management. Initial treatment includes intravenous fluids, pain medication, and antibiotics to cover common bacterial pathogens. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis will be ordered to confirm the diagnosis and assess for complications such as perforation or abscess formation. Surgical consultation has been requested due to the severity of symptoms.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the hospital. A surgical intervention may be necessary if the CT scan confirms appendicitis and rules out complications. The patient should expect a follow-up appointment with her primary care provider within one week after discharge to discuss postoperative care and recovery plans.
