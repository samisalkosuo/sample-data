Chief Complaint: Acute shortness of breath and chest pain

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, an 80-year-old male, presented to the emergency department with a sudden onset of severe shortness of breath and sharp, persistent chest pain that radiates to his left arm. He reports experiencing these symptoms for approximately 2 hours prior to arrival. The patient also mentions feeling lightheaded and profusely sweating. He denies any history of trauma or recent travel.

Physical Examination Findings: Upon examination, the patient appears anxious and in distress. His blood pressure is 160/95 mmHg, pulse rate is 120 beats per minute, respiratory rate is 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 88% on room air. Auscultation of the chest reveals decreased breath sounds and a systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's age, acute symptoms, and physical examination findings, an emergent diagnosis of possible acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is suspected. Further evaluation with electrocardiogram (ECG), cardiac enzymes, and chest X-ray is warranted to confirm the diagnosis and determine the extent of myocardial involvement.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be immediately started on aspirin, nitroglycerin, and oxygen therapy. A 12-lead ECG will be performed, followed by cardiac enzyme tests and a chest X-ray. If the diagnosis of ACS is confirmed, further management options such as percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) may be considered based on the extent of myocardial damage and patient's overall condition.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the intensive care unit (ICU). A cardiology consultation has been requested for further management decisions. The patient should expect frequent assessments of his vital signs, ECG monitoring, and potential interventions as needed. A follow-up appointment with the cardiologist will be scheduled upon discharge from the hospital to discuss long-term treatment plans and lifestyle modifications.
