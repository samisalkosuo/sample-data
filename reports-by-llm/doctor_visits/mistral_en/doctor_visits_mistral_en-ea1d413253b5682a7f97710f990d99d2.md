Chief Complaint: Acute abdominal pain and shortness of breath

History of Present Illness (HPI): A 38-year-old female presented to the emergency department with a chief complaint of severe, constant abdominal pain that began abruptly 6 hours ago. The patient also reported dyspnea, with an increasing shortness of breath over the past hour. She described the pain as sharp and localized in the lower right quadrant of her abdomen, accompanied by nausea and vomiting. The patient's vital signs upon arrival were: blood pressure 140/90 mmHg, pulse rate 120 beats per minute, respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute, temperature 38.5°C (101.3°F), and oxygen saturation 92% on room air.

Physical Examination Findings: On physical examination, the patient appeared distressed and in significant discomfort. Abdominal examination revealed localized tenderness and guarding in the lower right quadrant, with rebound tenderness and a positive Rovsing's sign. Auscultation of the abdomen revealed hypoactive bowel sounds. The patient's lungs were clear to auscultation, but she was tachypneic and had decreased oxygen saturation.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, and vital sign abnormalities, an urgent diagnosis of appendicitis with possible peritonitis is suspected. The patient's tachycardia, tachypnea, and decreased oxygen saturation suggest a systemic inflammatory response.

Plan / Treatment: The patient was immediately started on intravenous fluids and broad-spectrum antibiotics to address the potential for peritonitis. Pain management with opioid analgesics was initiated. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis was ordered to confirm the diagnosis and assess for any complications such as rupture or abscess formation.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the hospital's intensive care unit. Surgical consultation has been requested, and the patient is expected to undergo an appendectomy within the next 24 hours. The patient should remain NPO (nothing by mouth) until surgery. Postoperative follow-up will be arranged with the surgical team.
