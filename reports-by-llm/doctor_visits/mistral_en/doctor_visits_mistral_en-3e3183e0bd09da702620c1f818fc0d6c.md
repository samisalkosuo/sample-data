Chief Complaint: Acute abdominal pain and shortness of breath

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 43-year-old female, presented to the emergency department with complaints of severe, constant abdominal pain that began approximately 6 hours ago. The pain is localized in the lower right quadrant and radiates to the back. Accompanying symptoms include nausea, vomiting, and shortness of breath. The patient reports feeling generally weak and has been unable to maintain oral intake for the past few hours.

Physical Examination Findings: Vital signs reveal a heart rate of 120 bpm, blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on room air. Abdominal examination reveals tenderness in the lower right quadrant with guarding and rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds are hypoactive. The patient appears pale and diaphoretic.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, and severity level, a diagnosis of acute appendicitis is suspected. The presence of shortness of breath may indicate concurrent respiratory compromise due to possible peritoneal irritation or associated pleural involvement.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be admitted for further evaluation and management. Initial treatment includes intravenous fluids, pain management, and antibiotics. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis will be ordered to confirm the diagnosis and assess for any complications such as perforation or abscess formation. If the CT confirms appendicitis, surgical intervention will be necessary.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the hospital. A surgical consultation has been arranged, and a surgeon will discuss the specifics of the planned procedure with the patient. Postoperative care instructions will be provided upon discharge from the hospital. The patient is advised to follow up with her primary care provider for any post-discharge concerns or questions.
