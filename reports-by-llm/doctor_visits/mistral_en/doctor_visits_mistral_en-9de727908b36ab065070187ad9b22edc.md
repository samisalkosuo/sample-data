Severity Level: 2 (Emergent)
Patient Gender: Male
Patient Age: 77

Chief Complaint:
Acute shortness of breath and chest pain

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient presented to the emergency department with a sudden onset of severe chest pain, radiating to the left arm, accompanied by dyspnea. The symptoms began approximately 3 hours ago while the patient was at home. He reports no preceding trauma or known allergies. The patient's medical history includes hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, and a previous myocardial infarction 5 years ago.

Physical Examination Findings:
Upon initial assessment, the patient appeared anxious and in distress. Vital signs revealed a heart rate of 120 bpm, blood pressure of 160/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 88% on room air. Auscultation of the chest revealed diminished breath sounds in the left lung base with a systolic murmur heard at the apex.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are suggestive of an acute coronary syndrome, likely a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient's history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and previous myocardial infarction increases the likelihood of this diagnosis.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient was immediately started on aspirin, nitroglycerin, and morphine for pain relief and to reduce afterload. Oxygen therapy was initiated to improve oxygen saturation. Electrocardiogram (ECG) and cardiac enzymes were ordered to confirm the diagnosis and assess the extent of myocardial damage. The patient will be considered for urgent coronary angiography and potential percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient will be closely monitored in the cardiac care unit. A follow-up ECG, cardiac enzymes, and echocardiogram will be performed tomorrow to assess the response to treatment and evaluate left ventricular function. The patient will also be referred for cardiology consultation regarding further management and potential coronary revascularization. The patient's primary care physician will be notified of the hospital admission.
