Chief Complaint: Acute Respiratory Distress and Septic Shock

History of Present Illness (HPI): A 91-year-old male presented to the emergency department today, reporting severe shortness of breath, fever, chills, and generalized weakness for the past 48 hours. He also reported a history of confusion and decreased urine output over the same period. The patient has a background of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

Physical Examination Findings: Upon arrival, the patient appeared agitated and tachypneic with a respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute. His blood pressure was 90/60 mmHg, pulse 120 beats per minute, temperature 38.5°C (101.3°F), oxygen saturation 88% on room air, and respiratory rate 30 breaths per minute. Lung auscultation revealed bilateral crackles, and abdominal examination revealed diffuse tenderness without rebound or guarding.

Assessment / Diagnosis: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to sepsis, likely due to a lower respiratory tract infection. The septic shock is evidenced by the hypotension, tachycardia, and altered mental status.

Plan / Treatment: The patient was immediately intubated and mechanically ventilated. Intravenous antibiotics were initiated for suspected pneumonia, along with fluid resuscitation to address the septic shock. A chest X-ray was ordered to further evaluate the lung involvement. The patient will be closely monitored in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU).

Follow-up Instructions: The patient's family has been informed of his critical condition and the need for ongoing ICU care. Regular updates on the patient's progress will be provided to the family. A follow-up appointment with the primary care physician will be scheduled upon discharge from the hospital.
