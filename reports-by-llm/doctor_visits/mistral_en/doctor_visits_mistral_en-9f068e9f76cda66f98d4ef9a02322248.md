Chief Complaint: Acute abdominal pain and shortness of breath

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 47-year-old male, presented to the emergency department with complaints of severe, constant abdominal pain that began suddenly approximately 6 hours ago. He also reported experiencing shortness of breath and chest tightness over the past hour. The pain is localized primarily in the lower right quadrant of his abdomen and is accompanied by nausea and vomiting. The patient denies any history of trauma or recent changes in diet.

Physical Examination Findings: Upon initial assessment, the patient appeared uncomfortable and diaphoretic. Vital signs revealed a heart rate of 120 bpm, blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on room air. Abdominal examination revealed localized tenderness in the lower right quadrant with guarding and rebound tenderness. Auscultation of the abdomen revealed a possible bowel sound. The chest examination was significant for bilateral basilar crackles.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, and severity level 4 presentation, a provisional diagnosis of acute appendicitis with possible concurrent pulmonary edema is suspected.

Plan / Treatment: The patient was immediately admitted to the hospital for further evaluation and management. Initial treatment includes intravenous fluids, pain medication, and antibiotics. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and chest will be ordered to confirm the diagnosis and assess for any complications.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the hospital. Surgical consultation will be sought if the CT scan confirms appendicitis. The patient should expect a follow-up appointment with his primary care provider within one week post-discharge to discuss any ongoing symptoms and long-term management plan.

It is essential that the patient returns for follow-up appointments as scheduled, and he should contact the clinic immediately if symptoms worsen or persist.
