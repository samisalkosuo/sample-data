Chief Complaint: Acute Respiratory Distress and Septic Shock

History of Present Illness (HPI): A 100-year-old male presented to the emergency department today, reporting severe shortness of breath, fever, chills, and generalized weakness for the past 48 hours. The patient also reported a history of confusion and altered mental status. He has a background of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

Physical Examination Findings: Upon arrival, the patient was visibly agitated, tachypneic, and hypotensive. His respiratory rate was 30 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation was 88% on room air, blood pressure was 90/60 mmHg, pulse rate was 120 beats per minute, and temperature was 39°C (102.2°F). Auscultation of the chest revealed bilateral crackles and decreased breath sounds. Abdominal examination revealed diffuse tenderness and guarding.

Assessment / Diagnosis: The patient is currently experiencing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to sepsis, likely due to a lower respiratory tract infection. The septic shock is complicated by the patient's underlying conditions of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and COPD.

Plan / Treatment: The patient was immediately started on broad-spectrum antibiotics, intravenous fluids for hypotension, and mechanical ventilation to support respiratory function. A chest X-ray and blood cultures were ordered to identify the causative organism.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the intensive care unit (ICU). Consultations have been requested from pulmonology, infectious disease, and nephrology teams. Family members have been informed of the patient's critical condition and are encouraged to visit during designated visiting hours.

The patient's condition will be reassessed daily, and adjustments to treatment plans will be made as necessary based on lab results and clinical response. A follow-up appointment with the primary care provider will be scheduled upon discharge from the hospital.
