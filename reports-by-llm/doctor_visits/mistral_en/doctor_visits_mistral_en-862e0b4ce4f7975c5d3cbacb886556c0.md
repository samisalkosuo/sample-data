Chief Complaint: Acute shortness of breath and chest pain

History of Present Illness (HPI): A 70-year-old female presented to the emergency department with a two-hour history of progressive shortness of breath, accompanied by sharp, central chest pain that radiates to her left arm. The patient reports feeling lightheaded and experiencing profuse sweating. She has no known allergies and denies any recent travel or exposure to sick contacts.

Physical Examination Findings: Vital signs reveal a heart rate of 120 bpm, blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 93% on room air, and temperature of 37.5Â°C. On auscultation, there is a systolic murmur heard best at the left lower sternal border, with crackles present in the bases of both lungs.

Assessment / Diagnosis: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with an acute coronary syndrome (ACS), likely a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be admitted to the cardiac care unit for further evaluation, including electrocardiogram (ECG), troponin levels, and echocardiography. She will receive aspirin, heparin, and nitroglycerin for pain relief and to reduce myocardial ischemia.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the hospital for at least 24 hours. A cardiologist will discuss further management options, including potential percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or medications for secondary prevention of cardiovascular events. The patient should follow up with her primary care physician within one week for a comprehensive evaluation and medication management plan.

It is essential that the patient adheres to her prescribed treatment regimen, maintains a heart-healthy diet, and engages in regular exercise as recommended by her healthcare team. She should also avoid smoking and excessive alcohol consumption.
