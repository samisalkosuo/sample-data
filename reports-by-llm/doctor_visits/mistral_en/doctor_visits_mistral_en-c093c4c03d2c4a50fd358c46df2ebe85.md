Chief Complaint: Acute shortness of breath and chest pain

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 83-year-old male, presented to the emergency department with complaints of sudden onset of severe shortness of breath and sharp, persistent chest pain that radiated to his left arm. He reported experiencing these symptoms for approximately 2 hours prior to arrival. The patient also mentioned feeling lightheaded and profuse sweating. He has a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease.

Physical Examination Findings: Upon examination, the patient appeared anxious and in distress. His blood pressure was 180/95 mmHg, pulse rate was 120 beats per minute, respiratory rate was 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation was 92% on room air. Auscultation of the heart revealed a regular tachycardia with an audible S4 gallop. Lung auscultation demonstrated bilateral crackles in the lower lung fields.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's history, acute symptoms, and physical examination findings, it is suspected that the patient may be experiencing an acute decompensated heart failure or possibly a myocardial infarction.

Plan / Treatment: The patient was immediately started on oxygen therapy and intravenous morphine for pain management. A 12-lead ECG was performed, and laboratory tests were ordered, including troponin levels, complete blood count, and comprehensive metabolic panel. The patient was also given a loading dose of a diuretic to help manage fluid overload.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the cardiac care unit. A cardiologist will be consulted for further management, including potential coronary angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention if indicated. The patient's family has been informed of the situation and will be kept updated on his progress.

It is essential that the patient continues to receive optimal medical care and close follow-up to manage his underlying conditions and prevent further complications.
