Chief Complaint: Acute shortness of breath and chest pain

History of Present Illness (HPI): A 79-year-old female presented to the emergency department today with a sudden onset of severe shortness of breath and sharp, persistent chest pain that radiates to her left arm. The symptoms began approximately two hours ago while she was at home. She reports no associated cough, fever, or recent trauma. Her past medical history is significant for hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and a previous myocardial infarction three years ago.

Physical Examination Findings: Vital signs reveal tachycardia (120 bpm), tachypnea (24 breaths/min), blood pressure 160/95 mmHg, oxygen saturation 88% on room air, and a respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute. On auscultation, there is an audible S3 gallop, crackles in the left lower lung field, and diminished heart sounds.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's history of cardiac disease, acute symptoms, and physical examination findings, a suspected acute coronary syndrome (ACS) with possible pulmonary edema is highly likely.

Plan / Treatment: The patient was immediately started on oxygen therapy at 4 L/min via nasal cannula. A 12-lead ECG was obtained and showed ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads, confirming an acute myocardial infarction. She was promptly administered aspirin (325 mg), clopidogrel (600 mg), and a loading dose of heparin. A cardiology consult was requested for possible percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The patient will also receive intravenous morphine for pain management and nitroglycerin to reduce afterload and preload.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the intensive care unit (ICU) for further management and stabilization. A follow-up cardiology appointment will be scheduled within 24 hours of PCI, if performed, or as needed for ongoing management of her heart condition.
