Chief Complaint: Acute abdominal pain and shortness of breath

History of Present Illness (HPI): A 59-year-old female presented to the emergency department with a chief complaint of severe, constant abdominal pain that began abruptly 6 hours ago. The patient also reported experiencing dyspnea, with an increased respiratory rate and difficulty breathing. She described the pain as sharp and localized in the lower right quadrant of her abdomen, accompanied by nausea and vomiting. The patient's vital signs upon arrival were: blood pressure 140/90 mmHg, pulse 120 beats per minute, respiratory rate 28 breaths per minute, temperature 37.5°C (99.5°F), and oxygen saturation 92% on room air.

Physical Examination Findings: On physical examination, the patient appeared distressed and in significant discomfort. Abdominal examination revealed localized tenderness and guarding in the lower right quadrant, with rebound tenderness present. Bowel sounds were hypoactive. The patient's abdomen was mildly distended, and there was no palpable mass. Pulmonary examination revealed bilateral basilar crackles.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, and vital sign abnormalities, a provisional diagnosis of acute appendicitis with possible concurrent pulmonary edema was made.

Plan / Treatment: The patient was immediately admitted to the hospital for further management. Intravenous fluids were initiated, and oxygen therapy was started to address the respiratory symptoms. Laboratory tests, including complete blood count (CBC), electrolytes, liver function tests (LFTs), and coagulation profile, were ordered. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis was performed to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential causes of the patient's symptoms.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the hospital for any signs of worsening condition or complications. Surgical consultation has been requested, and the patient will likely undergo an appendectomy within the next 24 hours. The patient should continue to receive pain management as needed. A follow-up appointment with her primary care provider will be scheduled upon discharge from the hospital.

It is essential that the patient returns for a postoperative evaluation and any necessary follow-up care to ensure proper healing and recovery.
