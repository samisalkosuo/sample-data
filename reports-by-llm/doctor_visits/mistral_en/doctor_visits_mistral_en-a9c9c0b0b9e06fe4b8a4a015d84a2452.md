Chief Complaint: Acute Respiratory Distress in a 5-year-old male

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient presented with sudden onset of rapid, shallow breathing and increased work of breathing. He has been experiencing coughing fits with clear, mucoid expectorations for the past two days. The symptoms worsened overnight, leading to the current presentation. There is no reported fever, chest pain, or vomiting. The child has a history of asthma, but has not had any recent exacerbations.

Physical Examination Findings: On examination, the patient appears distressed with an respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute and an oxygen saturation of 88% on room air. Auscultation reveals bilateral wheezing and decreased breath sounds. The heart rate is 140 beats per minute, blood pressure is within normal limits, and the patient appears well-nourished with no signs of dehydration.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the acute onset of respiratory distress, increased work of breathing, and wheezing, this presentation is consistent with an asthma exacerbation. The patient's history of asthma and current symptoms support this diagnosis.

Plan / Treatment: The patient was immediately started on high-flow oxygen via nasal cannula to improve oxygen saturation. A nebulized bronchodilator and corticosteroid were administered to relieve bronchospasm and reduce inflammation, respectively. An intravenous line was established for fluid resuscitation and potential medication administration. The patient will be closely monitored for response to treatment and any complications.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be admitted to the pediatric ward for further management and close observation. A follow-up appointment with the pediatric pulmonologist will be scheduled within 24 hours of discharge to adjust medication regimen and provide education on asthma management. Parents are advised to return immediately if symptoms worsen or new symptoms develop.
