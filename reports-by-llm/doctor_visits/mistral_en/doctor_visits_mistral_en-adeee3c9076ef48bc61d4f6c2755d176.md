Clinic or Hospital Location: Pori Health Center

Severity Level: 4 (Less-urgent)
Patient Gender: Female
Patient Age: 66

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with a persistent, severe headache and dizziness over the past three days.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
Upon initial assessment, the patient reported that her symptoms began as a mild headache two days ago, which has since worsened and is now accompanied by dizziness and nausea. She denies any visual changes, speech difficulties, or loss of consciousness. The patient's symptoms are not related to physical exertion, environmental factors, or medication use.

Physical Examination Findings:
Vital signs revealed a blood pressure of 160/95 mmHg, pulse rate of 98 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and temperature of 37.2°C (99°F). On neurological examination, the patient demonstrated normal cranial nerve function, intact motor strength, and no signs of meningeal irritation.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
The patient's symptoms are suggestive of a possible migraine with increasing severity over time. However, given the patient's age and the persistent nature of her headache, further investigation is warranted to rule out other potential causes such as subarachnoid hemorrhage or brain tumor.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient will be admitted for observation, blood tests, and a non-contrast CT scan of the brain. If no abnormalities are found, she will be treated with migraine medication and discharged with follow-up instructions.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient is advised to return for a follow-up appointment in one week to discuss treatment progress and adjust medications as necessary. She should also maintain a headache diary to aid in the management of her symptoms. If her symptoms worsen or if she experiences any new symptoms such as loss of consciousness, visual changes, or speech difficulties, she is instructed to seek immediate medical attention.
