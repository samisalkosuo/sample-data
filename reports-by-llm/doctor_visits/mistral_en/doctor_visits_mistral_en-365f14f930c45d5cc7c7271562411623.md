Chief Complaint: Acute abdominal pain and shortness of breath

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 49-year-old female, presented to the emergency department with a sudden onset of severe abdominal pain localized in the lower right quadrant, accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and shortness of breath. The symptoms began approximately 6 hours ago and have since worsened. She reports feeling lightheaded and experiencing rapid heartbeat.

Physical Examination Findings: Vital signs revealed a blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg, pulse rate of 120 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on room air. Abdominal examination showed localized tenderness in the lower right quadrant with guarding and rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds were hypoactive.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of acute appendicitis with possible peritonitis is suspected. The severity level indicates an emergent situation due to potential life threat.

Plan / Treatment: The patient was immediately admitted for intravenous fluid resuscitation, pain management, and antibiotic therapy. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis will be ordered to confirm the diagnosis and assess for any complications. Surgical consultation has been requested due to the severity of symptoms.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the hospital's intensive care unit (ICU). A surgical intervention is anticipated within the next 24 hours, followed by a postoperative recovery period. The patient will receive further instructions from her surgeon and attending physician regarding discharge arrangements and follow-up appointments.

It is essential that the patient's family or caregivers remain available for updates and support during this critical time.
