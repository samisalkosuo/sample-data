Chief Complaint: Acute abdominal pain and vomiting

History of Present Illness (HPI): A 20-year-old male presented to the emergency department with a 6-hour history of severe, constant, localized lower abdominal pain that radiates to the back. The pain is associated with repeated episodes of non-bloody vomiting and decreased appetite. The patient also reports feeling nauseous and experiencing fever (38.5Â°C) and chills.

Physical Examination Findings: On examination, the patient appears uncomfortable but alert. Abdominal examination reveals tenderness in the lower left quadrant with guarding and rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds are hypoactive. No signs of peritonitis were observed.

Assessment / Diagnosis: The presentation suggests an acute appendicitis, a surgical emergency requiring prompt intervention due to its potential for rupture and subsequent peritonitis.

Plan / Treatment: The patient was immediately admitted for intravenous fluid resuscitation and antibiotic therapy. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis is planned to confirm the diagnosis and assess for any complications. Surgical consultation has been requested for possible appendectomy.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the hospital. Postoperative follow-up will be scheduled with the general surgeon as needed. The patient is advised to continue antibiotics as prescribed and to report any worsening of symptoms or fever.
