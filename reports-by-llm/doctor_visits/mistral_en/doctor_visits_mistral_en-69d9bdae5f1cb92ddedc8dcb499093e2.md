 Visit Date: June 25, 2024
Clinic or Hospital Location: Loimaa Health Center

Severity Level: 3 (Urgent)
Patient Gender: Male
Patient Age: 6 years old

Chief Complaint:
Acute abdominal pain and vomiting

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient, a 6-year-old male, presented to the clinic today with complaints of severe abdominal pain that started approximately 12 hours ago. The pain is localized in the lower right quadrant of his abdomen and is accompanied by frequent vomiting. He also reports feeling lethargic and having a low-grade fever (38Â°C). The patient has not passed stools or urine for the past 6 hours, which has further alarmed his parents.

Physical Examination Findings:
Upon examination, the patient appears uncomfortable but cooperative. His abdomen is tender to palpation in the lower right quadrant, with guarding and rebound tenderness noted. Bowel sounds are hypoactive, and there is no distension observed. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
The patient's symptoms and physical findings suggest an acute appendicitis. This condition requires urgent attention due to the potential for appendiceal rupture, which could lead to peritonitis.

Plan / Treatment:
Given the severity of the patient's symptoms, he will be admitted to the hospital for further evaluation and management. Initial treatment includes intravenous fluids, pain medication, and antibiotics to prevent complications. A diagnostic ultrasound or CT scan will be performed to confirm the diagnosis and assess the appendix's status.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient will be closely monitored in the hospital. The surgical team will discuss the possibility of an appendectomy, which may be necessary if the appendix is found to be inflamed or ruptured. The parents should expect updates on the patient's condition from the attending physician. They are advised to remain at the hospital until further notice.

The patient will follow up with his primary care provider for post-operative care once discharged from the hospital.
