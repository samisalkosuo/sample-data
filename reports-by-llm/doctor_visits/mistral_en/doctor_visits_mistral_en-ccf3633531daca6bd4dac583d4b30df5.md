 Visit Date: 09.07.2024
Clinic or Hospital Location: Orimattila Health Center

Severity Level: 3 (Urgent)
Patient Gender: Female
Patient Age: 6 years old

Chief Complaint:
Recurrent abdominal pain and vomiting over the past 2 days.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient, a 6-year-old female, presented to the clinic today with complaints of persistent abdominal pain and recurrent vomiting that started 48 hours ago. The pain is localized in the upper right quadrant of her abdomen and is accompanied by nausea and loss of appetite. She has not experienced fever or diarrhea, but her symptoms have worsened over the past day.

Physical Examination Findings:
Upon examination, the patient appeared uncomfortable but alert. Abdominal palpation elicited tenderness in the upper right quadrant with guarding and rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds were hypoactive, and no masses or distension were noted. The rest of the physical exam was unremarkable.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest an acute appendicitis. This is a surgical emergency that requires prompt attention due to the risk of appendiceal rupture, which can lead to peritonitis.

Plan / Treatment:
Given the severity of the patient's condition, she will be admitted for further evaluation and management. Blood tests, urine analysis, and imaging studies (ultrasound or CT scan) will be ordered to confirm the diagnosis and assess for complications. If appendicitis is confirmed, surgical removal of the appendix (appendectomy) will be performed.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient will be closely monitored in the hospital setting. Postoperative care instructions will be provided upon discharge, which may include pain management, antibiotics, and dietary recommendations. A follow-up appointment with the pediatric surgeon will be scheduled to assess healing progress and discuss any necessary postoperative care.

It is essential that the patient's parents or guardians contact the clinic if there are any changes in her symptoms or concerns about her recovery.
