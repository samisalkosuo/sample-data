Chief Complaint: Acute Respiratory Distress and Septic Shock

History of Present Illness (HPI): A 103-year-old male presented to the emergency department today, reporting severe shortness of breath, fever, chills, and generalized weakness for the past three days. The patient also reported a history of persistent cough with purulent sputum production and progressive worsening of symptoms over the past week. He has a background of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and congestive heart failure, for which he is currently on multiple medications.

Physical Examination Findings: Upon examination, the patient appeared acutely ill, with a respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 88% on room air, blood pressure of 90/60 mmHg, and a heart rate of 125 beats per minute. Auscultation revealed bilateral crackles and decreased breath sounds, with signs of peripheral edema. The patient's temperature was 39°C (102.2°F).

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's age, comorbidities, and acute presentation, a diagnosis of sepsis secondary to pneumonia is suspected. The patient's respiratory distress and hypotension are indicative of septic shock.

Plan / Treatment: The patient was immediately started on broad-spectrum antibiotics, intravenous fluids for volume resuscitation, and oxygen therapy via non-rebreather mask. A chest X-ray was ordered to confirm the diagnosis of pneumonia. Given the patient's advanced age and multiple comorbidities, a consultation with the intensive care unit (ICU) team was requested for further management and close monitoring.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the ICU. A follow-up appointment will be scheduled with the primary care provider upon discharge from the hospital to reassess the patient's condition, adjust medications, and provide ongoing management for COPD and congestive heart failure.
