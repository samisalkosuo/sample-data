Chief Complaint: Acute abdominal pain and shortness of breath

History of Present Illness (HPI): A 27-year-old female presented to the emergency department with a two-day history of progressively worsening, severe abdominal pain localized in the lower right quadrant. The pain is constant, sharp, and radiates to the back. Accompanying symptoms include nausea, vomiting, and decreased appetite. Over the past 12 hours, she has also developed shortness of breath, with an increased respiratory rate and dyspnea on exertion.

Physical Examination Findings: Vital signs reveal a heart rate of 110 bpm, blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, temperature of 37.8°C (100°F), and oxygen saturation of 92% on room air. Abdominal examination reveals localized tenderness in the right lower quadrant with guarding and rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds are hypoactive. The patient appears distressed, with a pale complexion and diaphoresis.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's presentation, symptoms, and physical examination findings, the working diagnosis is acute appendicitis complicated by possible peritonitis due to delayed presentation. The shortness of breath may be secondary to hypovolemia or respiratory compensation for metabolic acidosis.

Plan / Treatment: The patient requires immediate surgical intervention for suspected appendicitis and potential peritonitis. Intravenous fluids, pain management, and oxygen supplementation will be initiated prior to surgery. Laboratory tests, including complete blood count (CBC), electrolytes, liver function tests (LFTs), and coagulation profile, will be ordered.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be admitted to the surgical ward for further management and monitoring post-operatively. A follow-up appointment with the general surgeon will be scheduled within 24 hours of surgery to discuss the operative findings and post-operative care instructions.
