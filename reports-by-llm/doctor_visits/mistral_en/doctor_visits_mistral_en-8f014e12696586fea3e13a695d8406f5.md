Chief Complaint: Acute shortness of breath and chest pain

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 57-year-old male, presented to the emergency department with complaints of sudden onset of severe chest pain radiating to his left arm accompanied by profuse sweating and dyspnea. The symptoms began approximately 2 hours ago while he was at home and worsened over time. He denies any trauma or recent exertion prior to symptom onset.

Physical Examination Findings: Upon arrival, the patient appeared anxious and in distress. Vital signs revealed a heart rate of 130 bpm, blood pressure of 160/95 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 88% on room air. Auscultation of the chest revealed diminished breath sounds in the left lung base with a systolic murmur heard at the apex.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, and age, an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is suspected, most likely a myocardial infarction (MI).

Plan / Treatment: The patient was immediately started on aspirin, nitroglycerin, and morphine for pain relief. Oxygen therapy was initiated to improve oxygen saturation levels. An electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed, which showed ST-segment elevation in the leads V1-V6, confirming the diagnosis of an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The patient was subsequently transferred to the cardiac catheterization laboratory for urgent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent placement.

Follow-up Instructions: Post-procedure, the patient will be admitted to the coronary care unit (CCU) for close monitoring and management of complications. A follow-up appointment with a cardiologist will be scheduled within one week for further evaluation and medication adjustments. The patient was advised to maintain a heart-healthy lifestyle, including regular exercise, a balanced diet, and smoking cessation. He was also instructed to take prescribed medications as directed and to return immediately if any symptoms recur or worsen.
