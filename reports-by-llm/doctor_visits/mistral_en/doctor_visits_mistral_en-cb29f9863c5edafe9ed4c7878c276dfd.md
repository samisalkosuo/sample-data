History of Present Illness (HPI): A 20-year-old female presented to the emergency department with a 6-hour history of severe, constant, and localized lower abdominal pain that radiates to her back. The pain is accompanied by repeated episodes of non-bloody vomiting. She reports feeling nauseous and experiencing fever (38.5°C) and chills. She denies any trauma or recent surgery.

Physical Examination Findings: Vital signs show tachycardia (heart rate 120 bpm), normal blood pressure, and a temperature of 38.5°C. Abdominal examination reveals tenderness in the lower left quadrant with guarding and rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds are hypoactive.

Assessment / Diagnosis: The patient's presentation is concerning for an acute appendicitis, given the location of abdominal pain, rebound tenderness, and fever.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be admitted to the hospital for further evaluation and management. Initial treatment includes intravenous fluids, analgesics, and antibiotics. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and ultrasound will be performed to confirm the diagnosis. Surgical consultation has been requested due to the severity of symptoms.

She should remain in the hospital until discharge instructions are provided. If symptoms worsen or persist after discharge, she is advised to seek immediate medical attention.
