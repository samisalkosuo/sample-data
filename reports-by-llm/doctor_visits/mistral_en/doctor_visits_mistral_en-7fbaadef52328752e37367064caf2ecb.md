Chief Complaint: Acute shortness of breath and chest pain

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 66-year-old male, presented to the emergency department with complaints of sudden onset of severe chest pain radiating to his left arm accompanied by profuse sweating and dyspnea. The symptoms began approximately 2 hours ago while he was at home. He denies any preceding trauma or recent illnesses.

Physical Examination Findings: Upon arrival, the patient appeared anxious and in distress. Vital signs revealed a heart rate of 130 bpm, blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 92% on room air, and temperature of 37.5°C (99.5°F). Auscultation of the chest revealed diminished breath sounds bilaterally with a prominent S4 gallop.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's age, symptoms, and physical examination findings, an acute coronary syndrome is highly suspected. The patient's EKG showed ST-segment elevation in leads V1-V3, consistent with an anterior wall myocardial infarction.

Plan / Treatment: The patient was immediately transferred to the cardiac catheterization laboratory for urgent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Aspirin, clopidogrel, heparin, and nitroglycerin were administered intravenously en route to the cath lab. Oxygen therapy was initiated to maintain oxygen saturation above 94%.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the cardiac care unit post-procedure. A follow-up appointment with a cardiologist will be scheduled within one week for further management and risk factor modification recommendations. The patient is advised to continue taking prescribed medications as directed and to return immediately if any chest pain or shortness of breath recurs.
