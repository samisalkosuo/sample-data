Chief Complaint: Acute abdominal pain and vomiting

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 31-year-old female, presented to the emergency department with a 6-hour history of severe, constant, and localized lower abdominal pain that radiates to her back. She also reported recurrent episodes of non-bloody vomiting over the past 4 hours. The pain is associated with fever (38.5°C), nausea, and decreased appetite. There are no significant changes in bowel or bladder habits. The patient denies any history of trauma or recent travel.

Physical Examination Findings: On initial assessment, the patient appears uncomfortable but alert. Vital signs reveal tachycardia (120 bpm) and a fever (38.5°C). Abdominal examination reveals tenderness in the lower left quadrant with guarding and rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds are hypoactive. No abnormalities were found on cardiovascular, respiratory, or neurological examinations.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, and the severity level, a diagnosis of acute appendicitis is suspected.

Plan / Treatment: The patient was admitted to the hospital for further evaluation and management. Initial treatment includes intravenous fluids, analgesics, and antibiotics. A computed tomography (CT) scan will be ordered to confirm the diagnosis and assess for any complications. Surgical consultation has been requested due to the severity of symptoms.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the hospital. Follow-up appointments with the surgeon and primary care provider will be scheduled post-discharge to discuss further management and recovery plans. The patient is advised to seek immediate attention if symptoms worsen or new symptoms develop.
