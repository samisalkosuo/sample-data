Chief Complaint: Acute shortness of breath and chest pain

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 47-year-old male, presented to the emergency department with complaints of sudden onset of severe chest pain radiating to his left arm, accompanied by profuse sweating and dyspnea. The symptoms began approximately 2 hours ago while he was at home and have since worsened. He denies any preceding trauma or recent illnesses.

Physical Examination Findings: Upon initial assessment, the patient appeared anxious and in distress. Vital signs revealed a heart rate of 130 bpm, blood pressure of 160/95 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 88% on room air. Auscultation of the chest revealed diminished breath sounds and a systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, and elevated vital signs, an emergent diagnosis of possible acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is suspected. Further diagnostic tests are warranted to confirm the diagnosis and determine the extent of myocardial involvement.

Plan / Treatment: The patient was immediately started on aspirin, nitroglycerin, and oxygen therapy. Electrocardiogram (ECG), troponin levels, and a chest X-ray were ordered. In light of the potential life threat, the patient will be considered for urgent coronary angiography and possible percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the cardiac care unit. A follow-up appointment with a cardiologist will be scheduled upon discharge from the hospital to discuss further management and lifestyle modifications. The patient is advised to avoid strenuous activities and to seek immediate medical attention if symptoms worsen or recur.
