Chief Complaint: Acute abdominal pain and vomiting in a 9-year-old female patient

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient presented with a 6-hour history of progressive, severe abdominal pain localized primarily to the lower right quadrant. The pain is described as constant, sharp, and occasionally radiating to the back. Accompanying symptoms include frequent vomiting, loss of appetite, and lethargy. No history of fever, diarrhea, or constipation was reported.

Physical Examination Findings: On examination, the patient appears uncomfortable but cooperative. Vital signs reveal a pulse rate of 120 beats per minute, blood pressure of 90/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and temperature of 37.5°C (99.5°F). Abdominal examination reveals localized tenderness and guarding in the lower right quadrant with rebound tenderness on deep palpation. Bowel sounds are hypoactive. No signs of peritonitis were observed.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's age, acute onset of symptoms, localized abdominal pain, and physical examination findings, a possible appendicitis is suspected. The severity level indicates an urgent need for further evaluation and potential surgical intervention due to the risk of complications.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be admitted for further diagnostic tests, including laboratory work, urinalysis, and imaging studies (ultrasound or CT scan). Intravenous fluids will be initiated to address dehydration caused by vomiting. Pain management with appropriate analgesics will also be provided. If the diagnosis of appendicitis is confirmed, surgical intervention will be necessary.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the hospital for any signs of deterioration or complications. A follow-up appointment will be scheduled with a pediatric surgeon to discuss the results of diagnostic tests and plan for potential surgery. The patient's parents are advised to seek immediate medical attention if symptoms worsen or new symptoms arise before the scheduled follow-up appointment.
