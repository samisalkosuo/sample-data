Chief Complaint: Acute abdominal pain and vomiting

History of Present Illness (HPI): A 17-year-old female presented to the emergency department with a 6-hour history of severe, constant, and localized lower abdominal pain that radiates to her back. The pain is accompanied by repeated episodes of non-bloody vomiting. She reports no relief with over-the-counter pain medication and has not passed flatus or stool since the onset of symptoms. She denies fever, chills, or any genitourinary symptoms.

Physical Examination Findings: Vital signs reveal a heart rate of 120 bpm, blood pressure of 130/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and temperature of 37.2°C (99°F). On abdominal examination, there is localized tenderness in the lower left quadrant with guarding and rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds are hypoactive.

Assessment / Diagnosis: The patient's symptoms and physical findings suggest an acute appendicitis, a surgical emergency requiring prompt intervention due to the potential for rupture and peritonitis.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be admitted to the hospital for further evaluation and management. Intravenous fluids will be initiated, and broad-spectrum antibiotics will be administered to cover common appendiceal pathogens. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis will be performed to confirm the diagnosis and assess for any complications.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be seen by a general surgeon for possible appendectomy within 24 hours of admission. Postoperative follow-up will be arranged as needed. The patient should notify her primary care provider upon discharge for ongoing management.
