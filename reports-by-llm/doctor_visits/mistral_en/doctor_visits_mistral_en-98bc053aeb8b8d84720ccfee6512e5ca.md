Chief Complaint: Acute abdominal pain and shortness of breath

History of Present Illness (HPI): A 57-year-old female presented to the emergency department with a chief complaint of severe, persistent abdominal pain that began suddenly approximately 6 hours ago. The patient also reported experiencing dyspnea, or shortness of breath, over the past hour. She described the abdominal pain as sharp and localized in the lower right quadrant, accompanied by nausea and vomiting. The pain has been worsening over time, and she reports feeling lightheaded and weak. There is no history of trauma or recent surgery.

Physical Examination Findings: Vital signs revealed a heart rate of 120 beats per minute, blood pressure of 90/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on room air. On abdominal examination, there was localized tenderness in the lower right quadrant with guarding and rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds were hypoactive. The patient appeared pale and diaphoretic.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the acute onset of severe abdominal pain, localized tenderness, and signs of peritoneal irritation, the patient is suspected to have an appendicitis. The shortness of breath may be a result of hypovolemia due to potential perforation or sepsis.

Plan / Treatment: The patient was immediately admitted for further evaluation and management. Intravenous fluids were initiated, and broad-spectrum antibiotics were administered. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast was ordered to confirm the diagnosis and assess for any complications such as perforation or free air. Surgical consultation was requested due to the severity of symptoms and potential need for an appendectomy.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the hospital. A surgical team will evaluate her condition, and a decision regarding the need for surgery will be made based on the CT scan results. The patient should expect frequent assessments of vital signs, pain management, and fluid replacement. She is advised to inform the healthcare team immediately if her symptoms worsen or if she experiences fever, chills, or increased abdominal distension.
