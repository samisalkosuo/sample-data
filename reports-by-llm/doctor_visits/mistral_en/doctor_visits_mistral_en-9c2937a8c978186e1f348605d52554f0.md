Chief Complaint: Acute shortness of breath and chest pain

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 71-year-old female, presented to the emergency department with complaints of sudden onset of severe shortness of breath and sharp, persistent chest pain that radiates to her left arm. The symptoms began approximately 2 hours ago while she was at home and have since worsened. She denies any associated symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, or diaphoresis. Her past medical history is significant for hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, and a recent myocardial infarction 6 months ago.

Physical Examination Findings: Upon initial assessment, the patient appeared anxious and in distress. Vital signs revealed a heart rate of 120 bpm, blood pressure of 180/95 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 93% on room air, and temperature of 37.2°C (99°F). Auscultation of the heart revealed a regular tachycardia with an audible S4 gallop. Lungs were bilaterally dull to percussion and breath sounds were diminished, particularly in the left lower lobe.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's history of myocardial infarction, acute heart failure is suspected as the cause of her symptoms. The presence of an S4 gallop on auscultation supports this diagnosis. However, further evaluation with electrocardiogram (ECG), chest X-ray, and cardiac enzymes is necessary to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential causes such as pulmonary embolism.

Plan / Treatment: The patient was immediately started on oxygen therapy at 4 L/min via nasal cannula. Intravenous access was established, and a dose of morphine was administered for pain management. A stat ECG was obtained, and the patient was transferred to the cardiac catheterization laboratory for urgent coronary angiography.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the cardiac care unit post-procedure. A follow-up appointment with her primary care physician will be scheduled within 1 week to discuss further management and optimize medications for her underlying conditions. The patient was advised to continue taking her prescribed medications as directed, maintain a low-sodium diet, and engage in regular cardiac rehabilitation exercises. She was also instructed to seek immediate medical attention if symptoms worsen or recur.
