Chief Complaint: Acute abdominal pain and shortness of breath

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 51-year-old male, presented to the emergency department with complaints of severe, constant abdominal pain that began abruptly 6 hours ago. The pain is localized primarily in the lower right quadrant and radiates to the back. Associated symptoms include nausea, vomiting, and shortness of breath. The patient reports feeling generally weak and has been unable to maintain oral intake due to the discomfort.

Physical Examination Findings: Upon initial assessment, the patient appeared uncomfortable and diaphoretic. Vital signs revealed a heart rate of 120 bpm, blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on room air. Abdominal examination revealed localized tenderness in the lower right quadrant with guarding and rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds were hypoactive.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's presentation, symptoms, and physical examination findings, a diagnosis of acute appendicitis with possible peritonitis is suspected. The patient's urgent need for resources and potential hemodynamic instability necessitate further evaluation and management in the emergency department.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be admitted to the hospital for further evaluation and management. Initial treatment includes intravenous fluid resuscitation, pain management, and antibiotics to cover common enteric pathogens. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast will be ordered to confirm the diagnosis and assess for any complications.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the hospital. Surgical consultation will be sought for possible appendectomy. The patient should expect frequent assessments of vital signs, pain levels, and abdominal status. A follow-up appointment with the surgeon will be scheduled post-operatively to discuss recovery and any necessary post-operative care.

It is essential that the patient informs their healthcare team of any changes in symptoms or concerns during their hospital stay.
