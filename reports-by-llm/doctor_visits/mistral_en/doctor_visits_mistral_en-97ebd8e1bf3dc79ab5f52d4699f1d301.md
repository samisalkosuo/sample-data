Chief Complaint: Acute shortness of breath and chest pain

History of Present Illness (HPI): A 95-year-old female presented to the emergency department with a sudden onset of severe shortness of breath, accompanied by sharp chest pain that worsened over the past hour. The patient reported feeling lightheaded and experiencing profuse sweating. She has a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease.

Physical Examination Findings: Upon examination, the patient appeared agitated and was breathing rapidly with labored respirations. Her blood pressure was 180/95 mmHg, pulse rate was 120 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation was 88% on room air. Auscultation of the chest revealed crackles in the left lower lung field, and there was a regular tachycardia with no murmurs or gallops heard.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's age, medical history, and acute symptoms, this presentation is highly suggestive of an acute coronary syndrome, such as an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).

Plan / Treatment: The patient was immediately transferred to the cardiac catheterization laboratory for urgent percutaneous coronary intervention. Oxygen therapy, intravenous morphine, and aspirin were administered en route to manage pain and improve oxygenation.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the cardiac care unit post-procedure. A follow-up appointment with her primary care physician will be scheduled within one week for further management of comorbidities and long-term cardiovascular risk reduction strategies.
