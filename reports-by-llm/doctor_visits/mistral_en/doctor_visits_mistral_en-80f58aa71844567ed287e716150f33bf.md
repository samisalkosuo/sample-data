Chief Complaint: Acute abdominal pain and shortness of breath

History of Present Illness (HPI): A 51-year-old male presented to the emergency department with a 6-hour history of severe, constant abdominal pain localized in the lower right quadrant, accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and shortness of breath. The patient reported that the pain had started suddenly and was exacerbated by movement or deep breathing. He also mentioned experiencing fever, chills, and decreased urine output over the past 24 hours.

Physical Examination Findings: Vital signs revealed tachycardia (110 bpm), hypertension (180/100 mmHg), and a temperature of 39Â°C. The patient appeared uncomfortable, with pale skin and diaphoresis. Abdominal examination showed localized tenderness in the lower right quadrant, with guarding and rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds were hypoactive. Respiratory examination revealed bilateral basilar crackles.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, and elevated white blood cell count (15,000 cells/mm3), a diagnosis of acute appendicitis with possible peritonitis is suspected. The shortness of breath and pulmonary findings suggest concurrent pneumonia or pleural effusion.

Plan / Treatment: The patient was immediately admitted to the hospital for intravenous fluid resuscitation, broad-spectrum antibiotics (ceftriaxone and metronidazole), and analgesia (morphine). A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and chest was ordered. Surgical consultation was requested due to the possibility of peritonitis.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the hospital for signs of sepsis or worsening respiratory status. A surgical intervention may be necessary within 24 hours if the CT scan confirms appendicitis with peritonitis. The patient should inform his primary care physician about this hospitalization upon discharge.
