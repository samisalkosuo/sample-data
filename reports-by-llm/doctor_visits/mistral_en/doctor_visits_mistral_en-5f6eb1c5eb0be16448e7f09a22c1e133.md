Chief Complaint: Acute shortness of breath and chest pain

History of Present Illness (HPI): A 70-year-old male presented to the emergency department with a two-hour history of progressive shortness of breath, accompanied by sharp, central chest pain that radiates to his left arm. The patient reports feeling lightheaded and experiencing profuse sweating. He denies any recent trauma or exertion prior to symptom onset.

Physical Examination Findings: Vital signs reveal a heart rate of 120 bpm, blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 88% on room air. Auscultation of the chest reveals diminished breath sounds and a systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border. The patient appears anxious and diaphoretic.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's age, symptoms, and physical examination findings, this presentation is highly concerning for an acute coronary syndrome, specifically a possible myocardial infarction.

Plan / Treatment: The patient was immediately started on oxygen therapy and aspirin. A 12-lead ECG was obtained, which demonstrated ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads. The patient was subsequently transferred to the cardiac catheterization laboratory for urgent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the cardiac care unit post-procedure. A follow-up appointment with a cardiologist will be scheduled within one week for further management and risk factor modification recommendations. The patient should also adhere to a cardiac rehabilitation program as prescribed by his healthcare team.

It is essential that the patient returns for follow-up appointments and maintains open communication with his healthcare providers regarding any changes in symptoms or medication regimen.
