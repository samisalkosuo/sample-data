Chief Complaint: Acute shortness of breath and chest pain

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 66-year-old female, presented to the emergency department with complaints of sudden onset of severe shortness of breath and sharp, persistent chest pain that radiates to her left arm. She reports experiencing these symptoms for approximately 2 hours prior to arrival. The patient also mentions feeling lightheaded and profuse sweating. She denies any history of trauma or recent travel.

Physical Examination Findings: Upon initial assessment, the patient appears anxious and in distress. Her blood pressure is 160/95 mmHg, pulse rate is 120 beats per minute, respiratory rate is 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 88% on room air. Auscultation of the chest reveals decreased breath sounds and a systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is suspected. The severity level indicates potential life threat (Emergent â€“ Level 2).

Plan / Treatment: Immediate interventions include administration of oxygen via nasal cannula, morphine for pain management, and aspirin to reduce the risk of further thrombosis. A 12-lead ECG will be performed to assess for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). If STEMI is confirmed, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) will be initiated without delay.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be admitted to the cardiac care unit for further monitoring and management. A cardiology consultation has been requested. The patient should expect additional diagnostic tests such as blood work, echocardiography, and coronary angiography. Close follow-up with the cardiologist is essential for ongoing treatment and risk factor modification.
