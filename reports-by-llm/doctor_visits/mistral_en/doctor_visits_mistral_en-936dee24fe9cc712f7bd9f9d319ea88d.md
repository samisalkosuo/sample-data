Chief Complaint: Acute abdominal pain and shortness of breath

History of Present Illness (HPI): A 58-year-old female presented to the emergency department with a 6-hour history of severe, constant, and localized abdominal pain in the lower right quadrant. The pain radiates to the back and is associated with nausea, vomiting, and decreased appetite. Additionally, she reports dyspnea, orthopnea, and a dry cough for the past 2 days. She denies any chest pain, fever, or recent trauma.

Physical Examination Findings: Vital signs reveal tachycardia (110 bpm) and mild hypotension (90/60 mmHg). Abdominal examination reveals localized tenderness in the right lower quadrant with guarding and rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds are hypoactive. Pulmonary examination shows bilateral basilar crackles.

Assessment / Diagnosis: The patient's presentation is concerning for an acute appendicitis complicated by pleural effusion, potentially due to a systemic inflammatory response.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be admitted to the hospital for further evaluation and management. Initial treatment includes intravenous fluids, analgesics, and antibiotics. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and chest will be ordered to confirm the diagnosis and assess the extent of pleural effusion. If appendicitis is confirmed, surgical intervention will be necessary.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be followed up by the surgical team daily during her hospital stay. A follow-up appointment with her primary care provider will be scheduled upon discharge for ongoing management and monitoring of any residual symptoms.
