Chief Complaint: Acute abdominal pain and vomiting

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 35-year-old female, presented to the emergency department with a 6-hour history of severe, constant abdominal pain localized primarily in the lower right quadrant. The pain radiates to the back and is accompanied by frequent vomiting. She reports feeling nauseous and having a low-grade fever (38°C). The patient denies any trauma or recent travel but mentions a history of irregular menstrual cycles.

Physical Examination Findings: Vital signs show a pulse rate of 105 bpm, blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and temperature of 38°C. On abdominal examination, there is localized tenderness in the lower right quadrant with guarding and rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds are hypoactive.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, and history of irregular menstrual cycles, a diagnosis of acute appendicitis is suspected. The severity level is 2 (Emergent) due to the potential life threat posed by this condition.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be admitted for further evaluation and management. Initial treatment includes intravenous fluids, pain medication, and antibiotics. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and ultrasound will be performed to confirm the diagnosis and assess the appendix's status.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the hospital. Surgical consultation has been requested, and the decision for an appendectomy will be made based on the results of imaging studies and clinical response to initial treatment. The patient should expect a follow-up appointment with her primary care provider within one week post-discharge to discuss recovery and any necessary follow-up care.

It is essential that the patient seeks immediate medical attention if symptoms worsen or persist, as delay in treatment may lead to complications such as perforation of the appendix.
