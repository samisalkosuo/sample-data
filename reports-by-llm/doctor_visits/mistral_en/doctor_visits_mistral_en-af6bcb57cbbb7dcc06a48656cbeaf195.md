Chief Complaint: Acute abdominal pain and vomiting

History of Present Illness (HPI): A 20-year-old female presented to the emergency department with a 6-hour history of severe, constant, and localized lower abdominal pain that radiates to her back. The pain is associated with frequent, forceful vomiting, nausea, and loss of appetite. She denies any trauma or recent surgery. Her menstrual cycle was normal last month.

Physical Examination Findings: Vital signs show a heart rate of 110 bpm, blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and temperature of 37.5°C (99.5°F). On abdominal examination, there is tenderness in the lower left quadrant with guarding and rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds are hypoactive. No signs of peritonitis were observed.

Assessment / Diagnosis: The patient's symptoms and physical findings suggest an acute appendicitis, a potential life threat (Severity 2).

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be admitted for further evaluation and management. Initial treatment includes intravenous fluids, pain medication, and antibiotics to prevent complications. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and ultrasound will be performed to confirm the diagnosis. Surgical consultation has been requested.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the hospital. Surgery may be scheduled within 24 hours if the CT scan confirms appendicitis. Postoperative follow-up will be arranged with the general surgeon.
