Chief Complaint: Acute shortness of breath and chest pain

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 63-year-old male, presented to the emergency department with complaints of sudden onset of severe shortness of breath and sharp, persistent chest pain that radiates to his left arm. He reports experiencing these symptoms for approximately 2 hours prior to arrival. The patient denies any preceding trauma or recent travel but mentions a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia.

Physical Examination Findings: Upon initial assessment, the patient appears anxious and in distress. Vital signs reveal tachycardia (140 bpm), tachypnea (26 breaths/min), blood pressure 150/90 mmHg, oxygen saturation 88% on room air, and a respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute. Auscultation of the chest reveals decreased breath sounds and a systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's acute symptoms, history of hypertension, and physical examination findings, an emergent diagnosis of possible acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is suspected. Further evaluation with electrocardiogram (ECG), cardiac enzymes, and chest X-ray is warranted to confirm the diagnosis.

Plan / Treatment: The patient was immediately administered aspirin 325mg, nitroglycerin sublingually, and high-flow oxygen via nasal cannula. A 12-lead ECG was obtained, which showed ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads, confirming a diagnosis of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The patient was promptly transferred to the cardiac catheterization laboratory for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent placement.

Follow-up Instructions: Post-procedure, the patient will be admitted to the coronary care unit (CCU) for close monitoring and management of complications. A follow-up appointment with a cardiologist will be scheduled within one week for further evaluation and medication adjustments. The patient is advised to maintain a heart-healthy diet, engage in regular exercise, and adhere to prescribed medications to reduce the risk of recurrent events.
