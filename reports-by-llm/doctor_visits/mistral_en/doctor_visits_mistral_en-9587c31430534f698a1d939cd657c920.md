Chief Complaint:
Acute abdominal pain and shortness of breath

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient presented to the emergency department with a sudden onset of severe, constant abdominal pain localized in the lower right quadrant, accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and sharp chest pain. The symptoms began approximately 6 hours ago and have since worsened. The patient also reported shortness of breath and a fever of 38.5째C (101.3째F). He denies any history of trauma or recent travel.

Physical Examination Findings:
Vital signs: BP 140/90 mmHg, Pulse 110 bpm, Respiratory Rate 22 breaths per minute, Temperature 38.5째C (101.3째F). The patient appeared uncomfortable and in distress. On abdominal examination, there was localized tenderness and guarding in the lower right quadrant with rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds were hypoactive. A Murphy's sign was positive. On chest examination, there was bilateral basilar crackles.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
The patient is suspected to have an acute appendicitis complicated by a possible perforation, given the clinical presentation and physical examination findings. The shortness of breath and basilar crackles suggest possible pleural involvement due to peritoneal irritation from the ruptured appendix.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient will be immediately admitted for intravenous antibiotics (Ceftriaxone and Metronidazole) and fluid resuscitation. Pain management with morphine will also be initiated. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis will be performed to confirm the diagnosis and assess for any complications such as peritonitis or an abscess. Surgical consultation will be sought for possible appendectomy.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient will be closely monitored in the hospital. A follow-up appointment with the general surgeon will be scheduled after discharge to discuss the surgical findings and postoperative care. The patient should return to the emergency department if symptoms worsen or if fever persists.
