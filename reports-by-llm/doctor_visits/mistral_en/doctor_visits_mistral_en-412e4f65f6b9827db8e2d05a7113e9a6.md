Chief Complaint: Acute abdominal pain and vomiting

History of Present Illness (HPI): A 19-year-old female presented to the emergency department with a 6-hour history of severe, constant lower abdominal pain accompanied by repeated episodes of non-bloody vomiting. The patient reported that the pain started suddenly and has been worsening over time. She also mentioned experiencing mild fever and feeling generally unwell. No significant trauma or recent surgery was reported.

Physical Examination Findings: Vital signs revealed a temperature of 38.2Â°C, heart rate of 105 bpm, blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. Abdominal examination revealed tenderness in the lower left quadrant with guarding and rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds were hypoactive.

Assessment / Diagnosis: The patient's presentation suggests an acute abdomen, likely appendicitis given the location of pain and physical examination findings.

Plan / Treatment: The patient was immediately admitted for further evaluation and management. Laboratory tests including complete blood count (CBC), electrolytes, and inflammatory markers were ordered. An ultrasound of the abdomen is planned to confirm the diagnosis. Intravenous fluids and analgesics were administered to manage pain and prevent dehydration.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the hospital. Surgical consultation has been requested, and if appendicitis is confirmed, an appendectomy will likely be performed. The patient should expect frequent assessments of her abdominal pain, vital signs, and laboratory results. A follow-up appointment with her primary care provider will be scheduled upon discharge from the hospital to discuss postoperative care and recovery.

It is essential that the patient seeks immediate medical attention if symptoms worsen or new symptoms develop.
