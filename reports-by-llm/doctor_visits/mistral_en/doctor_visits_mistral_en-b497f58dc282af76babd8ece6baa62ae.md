Chief Complaint: Acute shortness of breath and chest pain

History of Present Illness (HPI): An 89-year-old female presented to the emergency department with a two-hour history of progressive shortness of breath, accompanied by sharp, retrosternal chest pain that radiates to her left arm. The patient reports feeling lightheaded and experiencing profuse sweating. She denies any recent trauma or exertion prior to symptom onset. Her past medical history is significant for hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease.

Physical Examination Findings: Vital signs reveal a blood pressure of 160/95 mmHg, pulse rate of 120 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 88% on room air. The patient appears anxious and diaphoretic. Cardiovascular examination reveals a regular tachycardia with a palpable precordium heave. Auscultation of the chest reveals a systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border, along with bilateral crackles in the lung bases.

Assessment / Diagnosis: The patient's presentation is consistent with an acute coronary syndrome, likely a myocardial infarction given her history of coronary artery disease and the physical examination findings.

Plan / Treatment: The patient was immediately started on aspirin, nitroglycerin, and morphine for pain relief and to reduce afterload. Oxygen therapy was initiated to improve oxygen saturation. An electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed, which showed ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads, confirming the diagnosis of an acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The patient was promptly transferred to the cardiac catheterization laboratory for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent placement.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the cardiac care unit post-procedure. She is scheduled for a follow-up appointment with her primary care physician within one week to discuss medication adjustments and lifestyle modifications. A stress test and echocardiogram will be performed in two weeks to assess left ventricular function and evaluate for any residual ischemia. The patient was advised to avoid strenuous activities, maintain a heart-healthy diet, and adhere to her prescribed medications. She was also encouraged to participate in cardiac rehabilitation.
