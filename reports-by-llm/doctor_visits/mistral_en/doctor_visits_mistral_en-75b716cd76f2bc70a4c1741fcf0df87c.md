Chief Complaint: Acute abdominal pain and vomiting in a 7-year-old female patient

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient presented with a 12-hour history of intermittent, severe abdominal pain localized to the right lower quadrant. The pain is associated with frequent episodes of non-bloody vomiting and decreased appetite. The symptoms started suddenly and have been progressively worsening over the past few hours. There are no reported fever, diarrhea, or urinary symptoms.

Physical Examination Findings: On examination, the patient appears uncomfortable but alert. Vital signs reveal a heart rate of 120 beats per minute and blood pressure of 95/60 mmHg. Abdominal exam reveals localized tenderness in the right lower quadrant with guarding and rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds are hypoactive, and there is no palpable mass.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the acute onset of severe abdominal pain, localized peritoneal signs, and the age of the patient, a diagnosis of appendicitis is suspected. The severity level is 2 (Emergent) due to the potential life threat posed by this condition.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be immediately admitted for further evaluation and management. Laboratory tests including complete blood count, electrolytes, and inflammatory markers will be ordered. An abdominal ultrasound is planned to confirm the diagnosis. If appendicitis is confirmed, the plan is for prompt surgical intervention.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the hospital. A pediatric surgeon will discuss the surgical details with the family. Postoperative care instructions and follow-up appointments will be provided upon discharge.
