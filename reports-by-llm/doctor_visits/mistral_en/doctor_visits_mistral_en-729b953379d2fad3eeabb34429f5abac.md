Chief Complaint: Acute shortness of breath and chest pain

History of Present Illness (HPI): A 70-year-old female presented to the emergency department with a sudden onset of severe shortness of breath and sharp, crushing chest pain that radiated to her left arm. The symptoms began approximately 2 hours ago while she was at home and have since worsened. She reports feeling lightheaded and experiencing cold sweats. The patient has no known allergies and denies any recent illnesses or injuries.

Physical Examination Findings: Vital signs upon arrival revealed a blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg, pulse rate of 125 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 88% on room air. Auscultation of the chest revealed decreased breath sounds and a systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border. The patient appeared anxious and diaphoretic.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the acute onset, severe symptoms, and physical examination findings, the patient is suspected to be experiencing an acute coronary syndrome, likely a myocardial infarction (heart attack).

Plan / Treatment: The patient was immediately transferred to the cardiac catheterization laboratory for urgent percutaneous coronary intervention. She received aspirin, nitroglycerin, and morphine for symptom relief and pain management. Oxygen therapy was initiated to improve oxygen saturation levels.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the cardiac care unit post-procedure. A follow-up appointment with a cardiologist will be scheduled within one week to discuss further management, including medications and lifestyle modifications. The patient is advised to avoid strenuous activities until cleared by her healthcare provider.

It is crucial that the patient returns for all scheduled appointments and follows the prescribed treatment plan to minimize the risk of future complications.
