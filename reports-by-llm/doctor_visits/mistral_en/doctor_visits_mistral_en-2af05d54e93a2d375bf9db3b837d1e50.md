Clinic or Hospital Location: Maarianhamina Health Center

Severity Level: 2 (Emergent)
Patient Gender: Male
Patient Age: 65

Chief Complaint:
Acute shortness of breath and chest pain

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient presented to the emergency department with a sudden onset of severe chest pain, radiating to the left arm, accompanied by profuse sweating and dyspnea. The symptoms began approximately 2 hours ago while the patient was at home. He denies any trauma or recent exertion prior to symptom onset.

Physical Examination Findings:
Upon initial assessment, the patient appeared anxious and in distress. Vital signs revealed a heart rate of 130 bpm, blood pressure of 160/95 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 88% on room air. Auscultation of the chest revealed diminished breath sounds and a systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are suggestive of an acute coronary syndrome, likely a myocardial infarction (MI). Given his age, risk factors for cardiovascular disease, and the severity of his presentation, an immediate evaluation is warranted.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient was immediately started on aspirin, nitroglycerin, and oxygen therapy. An electrocardiogram (ECG) was obtained, which demonstrated ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads, confirming a STEMI (ST-elevation myocardial infarction). The patient was subsequently transferred to the cardiac catheterization laboratory for urgent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient will be closely monitored in the cardiac care unit post-procedure. A follow-up appointment with a cardiologist will be scheduled within one week to discuss further management and risk reduction strategies, including medications, lifestyle modifications, and potential coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) if indicated. The patient was advised to avoid strenuous activity and to seek immediate medical attention for any recurrence of symptoms.
