Chief Complaint: Acute Respiratory Distress and Fever

History of Present Illness (HPI): A 4-year-old male patient presented with a 3-day history of high fever, persistent cough, and rapid, shallow breathing. The child has been lethargic and less responsive over the past day. The family reports no known allergies or recent travel, but mentions that the child was exposed to a sick relative last week.

Physical Examination Findings: Upon examination, the patient appeared pale and sweaty with a respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute. Auscultation revealed coarse crackles in both lung fields, and the oxygen saturation level was 88% on room air. The heart rate was elevated at 150 beats per minute, and the temperature was 39.5°C (103.1°F).

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's age, symptoms, and physical examination findings, a provisional diagnosis of pneumonia with possible secondary bacterial infection is suspected. The severity level indicates an urgent need for medical attention due to the potential life-threatening nature of the condition.

Plan / Treatment: The patient was immediately admitted to the pediatric ward and started on intravenous antibiotics, antipyretics, and oxygen therapy. A chest X-ray will be performed to confirm the diagnosis and determine the extent of lung involvement.

Follow-up Instructions: The child's condition will be closely monitored in the hospital. The family should expect regular updates on the patient's progress. A follow-up appointment with a pediatrician will be scheduled upon discharge to ensure proper completion of treatment and recovery.

It is crucial that the family adheres to the prescribed medication regimen and seeks immediate medical attention if the child's condition worsens or shows no improvement within 24 hours.
