Chief Complaint: Acute shortness of breath and chest pain

History of Present Illness (HPI): A 67-year-old female presented to the emergency department complaining of sudden onset of severe shortness of breath and sharp, persistent chest pain that radiates to her left arm. The symptoms began approximately 3 hours ago while she was at home and have since worsened. She reports feeling lightheaded and experiencing profuse sweating. The patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, but no recent changes in medication regimen or known allergies.

Physical Examination Findings: Upon initial assessment, the patient appeared anxious and in distress. Her blood pressure was 180/95 mmHg, pulse rate was 120 beats per minute, respiratory rate was 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation was 93% on room air. Auscultation of the heart revealed a regular tachycardia with an audible S4 gallop. Lung auscultation revealed decreased breath sounds and crackles in the left lower lung field.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, and history of hypertension, the working diagnosis is acute coronary syndrome (ACS), likely a myocardial infarction (MI). The urgency of this presentation necessitates further evaluation with an electrocardiogram (ECG) and cardiac enzymes.

Plan / Treatment: Immediate management includes administration of aspirin, nitroglycerin, and oxygen therapy. A 12-lead ECG will be performed to assess for ST-segment elevation or other abnormalities indicative of MI. Cardiac enzyme levels (troponins) will also be measured to confirm the diagnosis. If the diagnosis is confirmed, the patient will likely require urgent coronary angiography and potential percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be admitted to the cardiac care unit for close monitoring and further management. A cardiologist will be consulted for ongoing care. The patient should expect frequent assessments of her vital signs, ECGs, and cardiac enzyme levels. She will also receive appropriate medications to manage her symptoms and prevent complications. The patient's family is encouraged to ask questions and stay involved in the care plan.
