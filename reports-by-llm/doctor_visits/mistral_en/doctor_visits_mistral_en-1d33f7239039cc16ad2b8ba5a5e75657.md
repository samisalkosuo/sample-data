Chief Complaint: Acute shortness of breath and chest pain

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 78-year-old female, presented to the emergency department with complaints of sudden onset of severe shortness of breath and sharp, persistent chest pain that radiates to her left arm. The symptoms began approximately 3 hours ago and have worsened since then. She reports feeling lightheaded and experiencing profuse sweating. The patient has a history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus, but no recent changes in medication or known allergies.

Physical Examination Findings: Upon examination, the patient appears anxious and in distress. Her blood pressure is 180/95 mmHg, pulse rate is 120 beats per minute, respiratory rate is 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 93% on room air. Auscultation of the chest reveals diminished breath sounds in the left lung base with a pleural friction rub. Cardiovascular examination reveals tachycardia with a regular rhythm.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's acute symptoms, elevated blood pressure, and physical examination findings, I suspect an acute coronary syndrome, possibly a myocardial infarction. The pleural friction rub suggests possible concurrent pleurisy due to pulmonary edema.

Plan / Treatment: Immediate management includes oxygen therapy, morphine for pain relief, and aspirin to reduce the risk of thrombus formation. A 12-lead ECG will be performed to assess for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). If STEMI is confirmed, urgent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) will be indicated. The patient will also receive intravenous heparin and nitrates for further management of acute coronary syndrome and pulmonary edema.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be admitted to the cardiac care unit for close monitoring and further management. A cardiology consultation will be arranged, and an echocardiogram will be performed to assess left ventricular function. The patient should expect frequent blood tests and vital sign checks during her hospital stay. Close follow-up with a primary care physician and cardiologist is essential upon discharge for ongoing management of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease.
