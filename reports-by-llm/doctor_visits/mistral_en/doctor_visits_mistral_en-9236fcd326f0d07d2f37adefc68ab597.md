Chief Complaint: Acute shortness of breath and chest pain

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 79-year-old male, presented to the emergency department with complaints of severe shortness of breath and sharp, persistent chest pain that began approximately 3 hours ago. He reported feeling increasingly weak and experiencing profuse sweating. The patient has a history of hypertension and coronary artery disease, and he is currently on multiple medications for these conditions.

Physical Examination Findings: Upon examination, the patient appeared visibly distressed with an elevated respiratory rate (24 breaths/min) and heart rate (130 bpm). His blood pressure was 160/95 mmHg. Auscultation of the chest revealed diminished breath sounds and a systolic murmur in the precordial area. Oxygen saturation was 88% on room air, which improved to 94% with supplemental oxygen.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's history, acute symptoms, and physical examination findings, it is suspected that the patient may be experiencing an acute coronary syndrome, such as a myocardial infarction (heart attack).

Plan / Treatment: The patient was immediately started on aspirin, nitroglycerin, and morphine for pain relief. An electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed, which showed ST-segment elevation in multiple leads, consistent with an acute myocardial infarction. The patient was subsequently transferred to the cardiac catheterization laboratory for urgent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the cardiac care unit following PCI. He is expected to remain hospitalized for several days for observation and management of any complications. A follow-up appointment with his primary care physician will be scheduled upon discharge from the hospital, as well as a cardiology follow-up for further management of his coronary artery disease.

It is essential that the patient adheres to his medication regimen and lifestyle modifications (e.g., diet, exercise) as prescribed by his healthcare providers to reduce the risk of future cardiac events.
