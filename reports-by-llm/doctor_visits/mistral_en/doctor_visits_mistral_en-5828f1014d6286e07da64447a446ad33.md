Clinic or Hospital Location: Pori Health Center

Severity Level: 2 (Emergent)
Patient Gender: Male
Patient Age: 57

Chief Complaint:
Acute shortness of breath and chest pain

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient presented to the emergency department complaining of sudden onset of severe chest pain, radiating to the left arm, accompanied by dyspnea. The symptoms began approximately 3 hours ago while the patient was at home. He describes the chest pain as a crushing sensation, worsening with deep breaths and exertion. Associated symptoms include lightheadedness, nausea, and cold sweats. The patient denies any history of trauma or recent physical activity.

Physical Examination Findings:
Upon initial assessment, the patient appeared anxious and in distress. Vital signs revealed a heart rate of 120 bpm, blood pressure of 160/95 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on room air. Auscultation of the chest revealed diminished breath sounds and a systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border. The cardiac examination was otherwise unremarkable.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
Given the patient's symptoms, physical findings, and elevated blood pressure, an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is suspected, most likely a myocardial infarction (MI). Further diagnostic tests are warranted to confirm the diagnosis and determine the extent of injury.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient was immediately started on aspirin, nitroglycerin, and morphine for symptomatic relief and to reduce myocardial oxygen demand. Electrocardiogram (ECG) and cardiac enzymes were ordered. If the ECG shows ST-segment elevation, the patient will be transferred to the catheterization laboratory for urgent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient will remain in the hospital for close monitoring and further management as necessary. A cardiologist will discuss the results of the diagnostic tests and the treatment plan with the patient and his family. The patient is advised to avoid any strenuous activity and to follow a heart-healthy diet and lifestyle modifications post-discharge.

It is crucial that the patient returns for follow-up appointments as scheduled to monitor his progress and adjust medications as needed.
