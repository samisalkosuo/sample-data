Chief Complaint: Acute abdominal pain and vomiting in a 9-year-old female patient

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient presented with a 6-hour history of intermittent, severe abdominal pain localized primarily to the right lower quadrant. The pain is described as sharp and constant, accompanied by frequent vomiting. She also reports a low-grade fever (38°C) and decreased appetite. The symptoms began suddenly without any preceding trauma or known triggers.

Physical Examination Findings: On examination, the patient appears uncomfortable but alert. Abdominal examination reveals localized tenderness and guarding in the right lower quadrant with rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds are hypoactive. No signs of peritonitis were observed. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the acute onset, localized abdominal pain, and rebound tenderness, a possible appendicitis is suspected. However, further diagnostic tests are necessary to confirm the diagnosis.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will undergo an ultrasound examination to evaluate for appendicitis. If confirmed, she will be scheduled for an immediate appendectomy. Intravenous fluids and pain management will be initiated in the emergency department. Antibiotics may be administered preoperatively to prevent potential complications.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be admitted to the pediatric ward post-surgery for close monitoring and pain management. A follow-up appointment with the surgeon will be scheduled within a week after discharge to assess healing progress and discuss any necessary postoperative care instructions.
