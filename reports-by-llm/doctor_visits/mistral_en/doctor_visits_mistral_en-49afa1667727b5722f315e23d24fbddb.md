Severity Level: 2 (Emergent)
Patient Gender: Female
Patient Age: 14

Chief Complaint:
Acute abdominal pain and vomiting

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient, a 14-year-old female, presented to the emergency department with a 6-hour history of severe, intermittent abdominal pain localized primarily in the lower right quadrant. The pain is described as sharp and constant, accompanied by frequent vomiting. She also reports feeling lightheaded and experiencing chills. There is no history of trauma or recent travel.

Physical Examination Findings:
Vital signs: T 37.5°C (99.5°F), Pulse 120 bpm, Respirations 24 breaths/min, BP 100/60 mmHg. Abdominal examination reveals localized tenderness and guarding in the lower right quadrant with rebound tenderness. Rebound tenderness is a sign of peritoneal irritation, which may indicate an inflammatory process or possible appendicitis.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are suggestive of acute appendicitis, a potentially life-threatening condition requiring prompt surgical intervention.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient will be admitted for further evaluation and management. Initial treatment includes intravenous fluids, pain medication, and antibiotics to prevent potential complications. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and ultrasound will be performed to confirm the diagnosis. Surgical consultation has been requested for possible appendectomy.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient will be closely monitored in the hospital. The surgical team will discuss the timing of the procedure with the family. Postoperative follow-up will be scheduled as needed, and the patient will receive instructions on wound care and pain management.
