Chief Complaint: Acute Respiratory Distress and Septic Shock

History of Present Illness (HPI): A 103-year-old male presented to the emergency department with a three-day history of progressive dyspnea, fever, and generalized weakness. The patient reported experiencing increasing shortness of breath over the past few days, accompanied by high-grade fever and decreased appetite. He also mentioned experiencing confusion and disorientation.

Physical Examination Findings: Upon arrival, the patient was visibly agitated and tachypneic with a respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute. His blood pressure was 90/60 mmHg, pulse rate was 120 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation was 88% on room air. Auscultation revealed bilateral crackles in the lung fields, a weak and irregular heartbeat, and a rapid and shallow abdomen.

Assessment / Diagnosis: The patient's presentation is consistent with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to sepsis. The underlying cause of sepsis remains unclear at this time, but the patient's age and recent onset of symptoms suggest a possible urinary tract infection or pneumonia.

Plan / Treatment: The patient was immediately started on high-flow oxygen therapy, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and intravenous fluids for septic shock management. A chest X-ray was ordered to further evaluate the lung involvement. Intensive care unit (ICU) admission is necessary due to the critical nature of the patient's condition.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the ICU, and a multidisciplinary team will manage his care. A follow-up appointment with the primary care physician will be scheduled upon discharge from the hospital to address any ongoing concerns and adjust medications as needed.
