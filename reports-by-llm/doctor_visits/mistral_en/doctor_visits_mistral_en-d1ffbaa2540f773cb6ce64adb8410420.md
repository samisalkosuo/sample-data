Chief Complaint: Acute abdominal pain and vomiting

History of Present Illness (HPI): A 44-year-old female presented to the emergency department with a two-day history of progressively worsening, constant, and severe mid-epigastric abdominal pain radiating to the back. The pain is associated with nausea, vomiting, and anorexia. She denies any fever, chills, or bowel movement changes. The patient reports no history of trauma or recent travel.

Physical Examination Findings: Vital signs reveal a heart rate of 110 bpm, blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and temperature of 37.5°C (99.5°F). On abdominal examination, there is tenderness in the epigastric region with guarding and rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds are hypoactive. No signs of peritonitis were noted.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a provisional diagnosis of acute appendicitis is suspected. The severity level is 2 (Emergent) due to the potential life threat posed by this condition.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be admitted for further evaluation and management. Initial laboratory tests include complete blood count, electrolytes, liver function tests, and C-reactive protein. An abdominal ultrasound will be performed to confirm the diagnosis. If appendicitis is confirmed, surgical intervention (appendectomy) will be required.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the hospital. A follow-up appointment with the general surgeon will be scheduled post-operatively to discuss recovery and any necessary post-operative care.
