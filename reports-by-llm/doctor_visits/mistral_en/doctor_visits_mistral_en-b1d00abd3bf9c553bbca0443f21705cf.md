Chief Complaint: Acute abdominal pain and vomiting

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 13-year-old male, presented to the emergency department with a 6-hour history of progressively worsening abdominal pain localized primarily in the lower right quadrant. The pain is described as sharp and constant, accompanied by multiple episodes of non-bloody vomiting. He also reports fever, chills, and decreased appetite.

Physical Examination Findings: On examination, the patient appears uncomfortable but alert. Vital signs reveal a temperature of 38.5°C (101.3°F), pulse rate of 120 beats per minute, blood pressure of 110/70 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute. Abdominal examination reveals localized tenderness in the lower right quadrant with guarding and rebound tenderness.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's symptoms and physical findings, a diagnosis of appendicitis is suspected. The severity level indicates an urgent need for further evaluation and management due to the potential for complications.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be admitted for observation, intravenous fluids, and pain management. Laboratory tests including complete blood count (CBC), electrolytes, and C-reactive protein (CRP) will be ordered. An abdominal ultrasound or computed tomography (CT) scan may also be performed to confirm the diagnosis and assess for any complications such as perforation.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the hospital, and a surgical consultation will be sought if appendicitis is confirmed. The patient should return for follow-up within 24 hours post-surgery to assess recovery and wound healing. Antibiotics may be prescribed as part of the treatment plan.
