Chief Complaint: Acute shortness of breath and chest pain

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, an 87-year-old male, presented to the emergency department with a sudden onset of severe shortness of breath and sharp, persistent chest pain that radiates to his left arm. He reports feeling lightheaded and experiencing profuse sweating. The symptoms began approximately two hours ago and have worsened since then. The patient has a history of hypertension and coronary artery disease.

Physical Examination Findings: Upon examination, the patient appears anxious and in distress. His blood pressure is 180/95 mmHg, pulse rate is 120 beats per minute, respiratory rate is 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 93% on room air. Auscultation of the heart reveals a regular tachycardia with an audible S4 gallop. Lung auscultation demonstrates bilateral crackles in the lower lung fields.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's symptoms, history, and physical examination findings, there is a high suspicion of acute decompensated heart failure or an acute coronary syndrome (ACS), such as an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).

Plan / Treatment: The patient was immediately transferred to the cardiac catheterization laboratory for urgent percutaneous coronary intervention. Intravenous morphine, nitroglycerin, and oxygen were administered en route to manage pain and improve oxygenation. Aspirin, clopidogrel, heparin, and a beta-blocker will be initiated upon arrival at the catheterization laboratory.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will remain in the hospital for close monitoring and further management of his acute coronary syndrome. Follow-up appointments with the cardiologist and primary care provider will be scheduled as needed to optimize medical therapy and address any complications that may arise during recovery.
