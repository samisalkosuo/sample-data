The pain radiates to the back and is accompanied by frequent vomiting. She reports feeling nauseous and having a low-grade fever (38°C).

On abdominal examination, there is localized tenderness in the lower right quadrant with guarding and rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds are hypoactive.

Assessment / Diagnosis: The patient's symptoms and physical findings suggest an acute appendicitis of moderate severity.
