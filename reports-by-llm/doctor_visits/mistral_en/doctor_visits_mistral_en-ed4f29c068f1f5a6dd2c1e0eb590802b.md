Chief Complaint: Acute abdominal pain and fever in a 7-year-old female patient

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient presented with a 12-hour history of progressive, localized lower abdominal pain accompanied by intermittent vomiting. The pain is described as sharp and constant, exacerbated by movement and alleviated slightly by rest. The patient also reported a fever of 39°C (102.2°F) for the past 6 hours. There are no associated symptoms such as diarrhea, constipation, or urinary symptoms. The patient's appetite has been poor, and she appears uncomfortable but alert.

Physical Examination Findings: On examination, the patient is visibly distressed but cooperative. Vital signs reveal a heart rate of 130 beats per minute, blood pressure of 95/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. Abdominal examination reveals localized tenderness in the lower left quadrant with guarding and rebound tenderness. No distension or rigidity is noted.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the acute onset, localized abdominal pain, fever, and peritoneal signs, the patient's presentation is concerning for an appendicitis. This falls under Severity Level 3 due to the need for multiple resources and urgent attention.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be admitted for further evaluation and management. Initial steps include intravenous fluid resuscitation, pain management, and antibiotic administration. A diagnostic laparotomy may be necessary for definitive diagnosis and treatment.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the pediatric ward. Follow-up will be provided by the attending pediatric surgeon and primary care provider upon discharge. The family is advised to return immediately if the pain worsens, vomiting persists, or fever spikes.
