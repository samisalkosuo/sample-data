Chief Complaint: Acute abdominal pain and shortness of breath

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 36-year-old male, presented to the emergency department with complaints of severe, constant abdominal pain that began suddenly approximately 4 hours ago. The pain is localized in the lower right quadrant and radiates to the back. Accompanying symptoms include nausea, vomiting, and shortness of breath. The patient reports feeling lightheaded and experiencing a rapid heartbeat.

Physical Examination Findings: Vital signs upon arrival revealed a blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg, pulse rate of 120 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on room air. Abdominal examination revealed tenderness in the lower right quadrant with guarding and rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds were hypoactive. The patient appeared anxious and diaphoretic.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the acute onset, localized abdominal pain, and associated symptoms, the patient is suspected to have an appendicitis. The shortness of breath may be due to a respiratory compromise secondary to the abdominal condition or a concurrent pulmonary issue.

Plan / Treatment: The patient was immediately admitted for further evaluation and management. Intravenous fluids were initiated, and analgesics were administered for pain relief. Laboratory tests, including complete blood count (CBC), electrolytes, and liver function tests, were ordered. An abdominal ultrasound was performed to confirm the diagnosis of appendicitis. If confirmed, the patient will undergo an appendectomy.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the hospital for any complications or worsening symptoms. A follow-up appointment with a general surgeon will be scheduled post-operatively to discuss recovery and any necessary post-operative care. The patient is advised to rest, avoid solid foods until bowel sounds return to normal, and take prescribed pain medication as directed.
