Chief Complaint: Acute abdominal pain and shortness of breath

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 42-year-old female, presented to the emergency department with a sudden onset of severe abdominal pain localized primarily in the lower right quadrant, accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and shortness of breath. The symptoms began approximately 6 hours ago and have progressively worsened. She denies any history of trauma or recent surgery.

Physical Examination Findings: Vital signs revealed a heart rate of 120 bpm, blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on room air. Abdominal examination revealed localized tenderness in the lower right quadrant with guarding and rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds were hypoactive. The patient appeared distressed and was using accessory muscles to breathe.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, and age, a diagnosis of acute appendicitis with possible peritonitis is suspected. The shortness of breath may be due to respiratory compensation for metabolic acidosis secondary to the abdominal infection.

Plan / Treatment: The patient was immediately started on intravenous fluids and broad-spectrum antibiotics. Pain management with opioid analgesics was initiated. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis is planned to confirm the diagnosis and assess for any complications such as perforation or abscess formation.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the hospital's intensive care unit. Surgical consultation has been requested, and the patient will likely undergo an appendectomy within the next 24 hours. Follow-up appointments with the surgeon and primary care provider will be scheduled upon discharge from the hospital.

The patient was advised to continue taking prescribed medications as directed and to seek immediate medical attention if symptoms worsen or new symptoms develop.
