Chief Complaint: Acute severe abdominal pain and shortness of breath

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 30-year-old male, presented to the emergency department with a sudden onset of intense abdominal pain localized in the lower right quadrant, accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and severe shortness of breath. The symptoms started approximately 6 hours ago and have progressively worsened since then. The patient reports feeling lightheaded and experiencing chills. He denies any history of trauma or recent travel.

Physical Examination Findings: Vital signs revealed a heart rate of 120 bpm, blood pressure of 90/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 88% on room air. On abdominal examination, there was localized tenderness in the lower right quadrant with guarding and rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds were hypoactive. The patient appeared pale and diaphoretic.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the acute onset of severe abdominal pain, localized peritonitis, and respiratory distress, a diagnosis of appendicitis with possible perforation is suspected. The patient's vital signs indicate hypovolemia due to potential internal bleeding.

Plan / Treatment: The patient was immediately resuscitated with intravenous fluids and oxygen supplementation. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis was ordered for further evaluation. If appendicitis is confirmed, emergency surgical intervention will be required to remove the appendix. Antibiotics will also be administered to prevent peritonitis from spreading.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the intensive care unit (ICU) post-surgery. A follow-up appointment with the general surgeon will be scheduled for wound check and pain management. The patient is advised to continue antibiotics as prescribed and to report any worsening symptoms or fever.
