Chief Complaint: Acute shortness of breath and chest pain

History of Present Illness (HPI): A 55-year-old female presented to the emergency department complaining of sudden onset of severe shortness of breath, sharp chest pain radiating to her left arm, and profuse sweating. The symptoms began approximately 2 hours ago while she was at home and have since worsened. She denies any preceding trauma or recent illnesses.

Physical Examination Findings: Upon arrival, the patient appeared anxious and in distress. Vital signs revealed a heart rate of 130 bpm, blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 92% on room air, and temperature of 37.5Â°C. Pulmonary examination revealed bilateral crackles, and cardiovascular examination showed tachycardia with a regular rhythm.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's acute symptoms, tachycardia, and respiratory distress, an emergent diagnosis of possible acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is suspected.

Plan / Treatment: The patient was immediately started on oxygen therapy, aspirin, and a nitrate. An electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed, and the patient was given morphine for pain relief. A cardiology consultation was requested, and further diagnostic tests such as troponin levels and echocardiography were ordered.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the cardiac care unit. She is expected to undergo coronary angiography for definitive diagnosis and potential intervention. The patient will receive additional pain management and medications as needed. A follow-up appointment with her primary care physician will be scheduled upon discharge from the hospital.

It is crucial that the patient follows all prescribed medications and lifestyle modifications to reduce the risk of future cardiac events. She should also attend cardiac rehabilitation as recommended by her healthcare team.
