Clinic or Hospital Location: Kajaani Central Hospital

Severity Level: 2 (Emergent)
Patient Gender: Male
Patient Age: 62 years old

Chief Complaint:
Acute shortness of breath and chest pain

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient presented to the emergency department complaining of sudden onset of severe chest pain radiating to the left arm, accompanied by dyspnea. The symptoms began approximately 3 hours ago while the patient was at home. He reports no preceding trauma or known allergies. The patient's medical history includes hypertension and hyperlipidemia, both well-controlled with medication.

Physical Examination Findings:
Upon arrival, the patient appeared anxious but coherent. Vital signs revealed a heart rate of 120 bpm, blood pressure of 180/95 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on room air. Auscultation of the chest revealed diminished breath sounds in the left lung base with a systolic murmur heard best at the apex.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are suggestive of an acute coronary syndrome, likely a myocardial infarction given the patient's history of cardiovascular disease.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient was immediately started on aspirin, nitroglycerin, and morphine for pain relief. Oxygen therapy was initiated to improve oxygen saturation levels. An electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed, which showed ST-segment elevation in the leads V1-V6, confirming the diagnosis of a ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The patient was subsequently transferred to the cardiac catheterization laboratory for urgent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent placement.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient will be closely monitored in the cardiac care unit post-procedure. A follow-up appointment with a cardiologist will be scheduled within one week to discuss further management and medication adjustments. The patient is advised to maintain a heart-healthy lifestyle, including regular exercise, a low-sodium diet, and adherence to prescribed medications.
