Patient Age: 1

**Chief Complaint:**
Acute respiratory distress and fever in a 1-year-old female.

**History of Present Illness (HPI):**
The patient was brought to the clinic by her parents, reporting a sudden onset of rapid breathing, coughing, and high fever over the past 24 hours. The child has been lethargic and less responsive since the symptoms started. No known allergies or significant medical history were reported.

**Physical Examination Findings:**
Upon examination, the patient was found to be tachypneic (rapid breathing) with a respiratory rate of 60 breaths per minute. Her temperature was 39.5°C (103.1°F), pulse was 140 bpm, and blood pressure was within normal limits for her age. Auscultation revealed coarse crackles in the lower lung fields, suggestive of pneumonia. The child appeared distressed and uncomfortable.

**Assessment / Diagnosis:**
The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia. Given her age and severity of symptoms, this is considered an urgent case due to the potential for rapid progression and complications.

**Plan / Treatment:**
The patient will be admitted to the pediatric ward for intravenous antibiotics and close monitoring. Oxygen therapy will be initiated as needed to support her breathing. A chest X-ray will be ordered to confirm the diagnosis and guide further management.

**Follow-up Instructions:**
The parents should remain with their daughter during her hospital stay. The pediatric team will provide regular updates on her condition and adjust treatment plans as necessary. The patient is expected to remain in the hospital for at least 48 hours, depending on her response to treatment. A follow-up appointment will be scheduled upon discharge to ensure complete resolution of symptoms and to discuss any ongoing care needs.
