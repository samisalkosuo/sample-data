Clinic or Hospital Location: Karvia Health Center

Severity Level: 4 (Less-urgent)
Patient Gender: Male
Patient Age: 46

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with a persistent, non-productive cough and mild shortness of breath over the past week.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient reported that the symptoms started gradually without any known triggers or exacerbating factors. He described the cough as dry and hacking, occurring frequently throughout the day and night. The shortness of breath was intermittent but noticeable during physical activity. There were no associated symptoms such as fever, chest pain, or hemoptysis.

Physical Examination Findings:
Upon examination, the patient appeared comfortable with a normal vital sign profile (BP: 120/80 mmHg, Pulse: 90 bpm, RR: 18 breaths/min, SpO2: 97% on room air). The respiratory rate was slightly elevated, and auscultation of the lungs revealed a basilar crackle in the left lung field. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a preliminary diagnosis of left lower lobe pneumonia is suspected. Further diagnostic tests such as chest X-ray or CT scan may be required for confirmation.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient was prescribed a course of antibiotics (Levofloxacin 500mg daily) for 7 days to treat the suspected pneumonia. Over-the-counter cough suppressants and expectorants were also recommended to alleviate symptoms. The patient was advised to follow up in one week for reevaluation and adjustment of treatment if necessary.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient should return for a follow-up appointment on June 6, 2025, to assess the response to treatment and monitor any changes in symptoms. If symptoms worsen or new symptoms develop before the scheduled follow-up, the patient is advised to seek immediate medical attention. The patient was also educated about the importance of completing the full course of antibiotics to ensure effective treatment and prevent antibiotic resistance.
