Chief Complaint: Acute abdominal pain and shortness of breath

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 43-year-old male, presented to the emergency department with complaints of severe, constant abdominal pain that began abruptly 6 hours ago. The pain is localized in the lower right quadrant and radiates to the back. Associated symptoms include nausea, vomiting, and shortness of breath. The patient reports feeling generally weak and lethargic.

Physical Examination Findings: Vital signs reveal tachycardia (heart rate 120 bpm) and mild hypotension (blood pressure 110/70 mmHg). Abdominal examination reveals localized tenderness in the lower right quadrant with guarding and rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds are hypoactive. Respiratory examination shows bilateral basilar crackles, suggesting possible pleural effusion.

Assessment / Diagnosis: The patient's presentation suggests an acute abdomen, likely appendicitis complicated by paralytic ileus and possible pleural effusion due to diaphragmatic irritation. Given the severity of symptoms and the patient's age, a possible perforated appendix should be considered.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be admitted for urgent surgical evaluation and potential appendectomy. Intravenous fluids will be initiated to correct hypovolemia. Pain management with opioids will be provided as needed. A chest X-ray and ultrasound of the abdomen will be ordered to further evaluate the pleural effusion and appendix, respectively.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the hospital. Postoperative follow-up will be scheduled with the general surgeon. The patient should report any worsening of symptoms or fever to the healthcare provider immediately.
