Chief Complaint: Acute abdominal pain and shortness of breath

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 51-year-old female, presented to the emergency department with complaints of severe, constant abdominal pain that began approximately 6 hours ago. The pain is localized in the lower right quadrant and radiates to the back. Accompanying symptoms include nausea, vomiting, and shortness of breath. The patient reports feeling lightheaded and experiencing a rapid heartbeat. She denies any history of trauma or recent travel.

Physical Examination Findings: Vital signs reveal a blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg, pulse rate of 120 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and temperature of 37.5°C (99.5°F). On abdominal examination, there is localized tenderness in the lower right quadrant with guarding and rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds are hypoactive. The patient appears distressed due to shortness of breath, with respirations being labored.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, and age, a diagnosis of acute appendicitis with possible peritonitis is suspected. The urgency of the presentation warrants this level 3 severity classification due to the potential for rapid deterioration.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be admitted to the hospital for further evaluation and management. Initial treatment includes intravenous fluid resuscitation, pain management, and antibiotics to address any possible infection. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis will be ordered to confirm the diagnosis and assess for complications such as perforation or abscess formation. Surgical consultation is also being requested due to the severity of the patient's symptoms.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the hospital, with follow-ups scheduled by the surgical team and primary care physician once discharged. It is essential that the patient adheres to any prescribed medications and follows up as directed for optimal recovery.
