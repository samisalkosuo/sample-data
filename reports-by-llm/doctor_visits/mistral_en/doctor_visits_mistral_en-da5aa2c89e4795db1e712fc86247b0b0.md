 Visit Date: 12.09.2023
Clinic or Hospital Location: Tervola Health Center

Severity Level: 4 (Less-urgent)
Patient Gender: Male
Patient Age: 24

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with a persistent, non-productive cough and intermittent chest discomfort for the past week.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient reported that the symptoms started approximately one week ago, initially as an occasional dry cough but escalated to daily occurrences accompanied by mild chest pain, particularly on the left side. The discomfort is described as a dull, constant ache that worsens with deep breathing or physical exertion. He denies any associated fever, chills, shortness of breath, or hemoptysis. There are no known triggers for these symptoms, and he has not recently traveled or been exposed to sick individuals.

Physical Examination Findings:
Upon examination, the patient appeared comfortable with a normal vital sign assessment (BP 120/80 mmHg, Pulse 78 bpm, RR 16 breaths/min, SpO2 98% on room air). His respiratory rate was slightly elevated, and auscultation of the chest revealed a mildly increased respiratory effort with occasional wheezes heard on the left side. The cardiovascular examination was unremarkable.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, it is suspected that he may be experiencing an acute bronchitis episode. However, further diagnostic tests such as a chest X-ray or pulmonary function tests may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential causes of his symptoms.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient was prescribed a course of antibiotics (Amoxicillin 500mg TID for 7 days) to help alleviate the bacterial infection, if present. In addition, he was advised to use an over-the-counter cough suppressant and expectorant as needed for symptomatic relief. The patient was also encouraged to rest, stay hydrated, and avoid smoking or exposure to secondhand smoke during his recovery.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient is scheduled for a follow-up appointment in one week to assess the response to treatment and determine if any additional tests are necessary. He should return sooner if symptoms worsen or if he develops fever, shortness of breath, or hemoptysis. The patient was provided with educational materials on managing his symptoms at home and preventing further complications.
