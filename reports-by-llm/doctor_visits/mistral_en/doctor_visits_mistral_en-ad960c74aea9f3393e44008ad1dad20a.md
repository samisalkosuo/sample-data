Chief Complaint:
Fever and lethargy in a one-year-old female patient.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient was brought to the clinic by her mother, who reported that the child had been febrile for the past 24 hours with intermittent vomiting and decreased appetite. The mother also noted that the patient has been less active than usual and has shown signs of irritability. The fever peaked at 39°C (102.2°F) earlier today, but has since subsided to 38°C (100.4°F).

Physical Examination Findings:
Upon examination, the patient appeared mildly dehydrated with dry mucous membranes and a sunken fontanel. Her temperature was 38°C (100.4°F), pulse rate was 150 beats per minute, respiratory rate was 26 breaths per minute, and blood pressure was within normal limits for her age. A thorough head-to-toe examination revealed no abnormalities, except for a mildly enlarged liver palpated during abdominal examination.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
Given the patient's symptoms, fever, and physical findings, I suspect a viral infection, possibly influenza or gastroenteritis. The enlarged liver may be a secondary finding related to the viral illness. However, due to the severity of the presentation and the patient's age, it is essential to rule out bacterial sepsis.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient will be admitted for further evaluation, including complete blood count (CBC), liver function tests (LFTs), urinalysis, and a respiratory panel. Intravenous fluids will be initiated to address dehydration, and antipyretics will be administered to manage fever. Antiviral therapy may be considered based on the results of the respiratory panel.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient will be closely monitored in the hospital for any signs of deterioration. The pediatric team will provide further instructions regarding discharge and follow-up appointments once the patient's condition stabilizes. Parents are advised to continue monitoring the child's temperature and symptoms at home. If the child's condition worsens or if she develops difficulty breathing, they should seek immediate medical attention.
