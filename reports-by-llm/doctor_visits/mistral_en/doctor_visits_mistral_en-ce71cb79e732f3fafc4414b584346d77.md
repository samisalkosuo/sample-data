Clinic or Hospital Location: Kempele Health Center

Severity Level: 2 (Emergent)
Patient Gender: Female
Patient Age: 67

Chief Complaint:
Acute shortness of breath and chest pain

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient presented to the emergency department with a sudden onset of severe chest pain, radiating to the left arm, accompanied by dyspnea. The symptoms began approximately 3 hours ago while she was at home. She reports no preceding trauma or known allergies. The patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, for which she is currently on medication.

Physical Examination Findings:
Upon examination, the patient appeared anxious and in distress. Her blood pressure was 180/95 mmHg, pulse rate was 120 beats per minute, respiratory rate was 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation was 93% on room air. Auscultation of the heart revealed a regular tachycardia with a systolic murmur heard best at the left lower sternal border. Lung auscultation revealed decreased breath sounds bilaterally, particularly in the bases.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are suggestive of an acute coronary syndrome, likely a myocardial infarction given her history of cardiovascular disease.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient was immediately started on aspirin, nitroglycerin, and morphine for pain relief and to reduce myocardial oxygen demand. Oxygen therapy was initiated to improve oxygenation levels. An electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed and showed ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads, confirming the diagnosis of a STEMI (ST-elevation myocardial infarction). The patient was urgently transferred to the cardiac catheterization laboratory for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient will be closely monitored in the cardiac care unit post-procedure. A follow-up appointment with her primary care physician and a cardiologist will be scheduled within one week to discuss further management, including medication adjustments and lifestyle modifications. The patient was advised to continue taking her prescribed medications as directed and to return immediately if symptoms worsen or recur.
