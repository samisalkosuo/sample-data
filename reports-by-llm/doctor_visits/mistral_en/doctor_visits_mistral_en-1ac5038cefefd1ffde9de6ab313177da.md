Chief Complaint: Acute shortness of breath and chest pain

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 67-year-old female, presented to the emergency department with complaints of sudden onset of severe shortness of breath and sharp, crushing chest pain that radiated to her left arm. The symptoms began approximately 3 hours ago while she was at home. She reports no preceding trauma or known allergies.

Physical Examination Findings: Vital signs revealed a heart rate of 120 bpm, blood pressure of 160/95 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 88% on room air. Auscultation of the chest revealed decreased breath sounds and a systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border. The patient appeared anxious and diaphoretic.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's age, symptoms, and physical examination findings, an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is suspected, likely a myocardial infarction (MI).

Plan / Treatment: The patient was immediately started on oxygen therapy and aspirin. A 12-lead ECG was performed, which showed ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads, confirming the diagnosis of an ST-elevation MI. The patient was transferred to the cardiac catheterization laboratory for urgent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the cardiac care unit post-procedure. A follow-up appointment with a cardiologist will be scheduled within one week for further management and risk factor modification. The patient was advised to continue aspirin therapy as prescribed, and to seek immediate medical attention if symptoms recur or worsen.
