Chief Complaint: Acute severe abdominal pain and shortness of breath

History of Present Illness (HPI): A 56-year-old female presented to the emergency department with a chief complaint of acute, severe abdominal pain that began suddenly approximately 4 hours ago. The patient described the pain as constant, sharp, and localized in the lower right quadrant of her abdomen. Accompanying symptoms include nausea, vomiting, and shortness of breath. The patient reports feeling lightheaded and experiencing a rapid heartbeat. She denies any history of trauma or recent surgery.

Physical Examination Findings: Vital signs upon arrival revealed a blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg, pulse rate of 120 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on room air. On abdominal examination, there was localized tenderness in the lower right quadrant with guarding and rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds were hypoactive. The patient appeared anxious and diaphoretic.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the acute onset of severe abdominal pain, localized tenderness, and associated symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, shortness of breath, and tachycardia, a diagnosis of acute appendicitis with possible peritonitis is suspected.

Plan / Treatment: The patient was immediately admitted to the hospital for further management. Intravenous fluids were initiated, and broad-spectrum antibiotics were administered to cover potential intra-abdominal infection. Pain management was provided with intravenous opioids. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis was ordered to confirm the diagnosis and assess for any complications such as perforation or abscess formation.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the hospital. Surgical consultation has been requested, and an appendectomy may be performed if the CT scan confirms the diagnosis of acute appendicitis. The patient should expect to remain in the hospital for several days post-surgery for recovery and pain management. Follow-up appointments will be scheduled with the surgeon and primary care provider as needed.
