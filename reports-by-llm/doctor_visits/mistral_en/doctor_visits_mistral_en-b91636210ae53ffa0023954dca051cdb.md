Clinic or Hospital Location: Lapua Healthcare Center

Severity Level: 1 (Resuscitation â€“ immediate life threat)
Patient Gender: Male
Patient Age: 88

Chief Complaint:
Acute shortness of breath and chest pain

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient, an 88-year-old male, presented to the emergency department with a sudden onset of severe shortness of breath and chest pain that began approximately 2 hours ago. The patient reported feeling pressure in his chest, accompanied by profuse sweating and lightheadedness. He denied any associated symptoms such as arm or jaw pain, nausea, or vomiting.

Physical Examination Findings:
Upon arrival, the patient appeared visibly distressed with a respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, blood pressure of 90/60 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 88% on room air. Auscultation revealed bilateral crackles in the lung bases, and the cardiac examination revealed an irregular heart rhythm with a heart rate of 140 beats per minute.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
The patient's presentation is highly suggestive of an acute coronary syndrome, likely a myocardial infarction (heart attack). The rapid onset of symptoms, the presence of chest pain and shortness of breath, along with the physical examination findings, support this diagnosis.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient was immediately transferred to the cardiac catheterization laboratory for urgent coronary angiography and potential percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Intravenous aspirin, clopidogrel, heparin, nitroglycerin, and morphine were administered en route to manage symptoms and reduce myocardial damage.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient will be closely monitored in the cardiac care unit post-procedure. A follow-up appointment with a cardiologist will be scheduled within 1 week for further management and risk factor modification recommendations. The patient's family has been informed of the situation and is encouraged to remain supportive during this critical period.
