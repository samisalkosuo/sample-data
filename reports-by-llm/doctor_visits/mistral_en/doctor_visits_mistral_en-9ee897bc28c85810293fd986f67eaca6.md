Chief Complaint: Acute abdominal pain and shortness of breath

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 51-year-old male, presented to the emergency department with complaints of severe, constant abdominal pain that began approximately 6 hours ago. The pain is localized in the lower right quadrant and radiates to the back. Accompanying symptoms include nausea, vomiting, and shortness of breath. The patient reports feeling generally weak and has been unable to maintain oral intake due to the discomfort.

Physical Examination Findings: Vital signs reveal a heart rate of 120 bpm, blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on room air. Abdominal examination reveals tenderness in the lower right quadrant with guarding and rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds are hypoactive. The patient appears pale and diaphoretic.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, and age, a diagnosis of acute appendicitis is suspected. The presence of shortness of breath may indicate concurrent pleural involvement or pulmonary embolism, which requires further investigation.

Plan / Treatment: The patient will be admitted to the hospital for further evaluation and management. Initial treatment includes intravenous fluids, pain medication, and antibiotics. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast will be ordered to confirm the diagnosis and assess for any complications. If a pleural effusion is detected on the CT scan, a chest X-ray may also be performed.

Follow-up Instructions: The patient will be closely monitored in the hospital. A surgical consultation will be arranged for possible appendectomy. The patient should expect to remain in the hospital for several days post-surgery. Follow-up appointments with the surgeon and primary care provider will be scheduled as needed.
