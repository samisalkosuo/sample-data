Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with acute abdominal pain and vomiting.

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient reported a sudden onset of severe, constant abdominal pain localized to the lower right quadrant, accompanied by nausea and repeated vomiting for approximately 6 hours prior to arrival. The pain was described as sharp and intense, with no relief from any position or medication. She also reported a low-grade fever (38Â°C) and decreased appetite.

Physical Examination Findings:
Upon examination, the patient appeared uncomfortable but alert. Abdominal examination revealed localized tenderness in the lower right quadrant, with guarding and rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds were hypoactive. No signs of peritonitis were observed.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
The presentation suggests an acute appendicitis. The patient's symptoms are consistent with this diagnosis, and the physical examination findings support this assessment.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient was immediately admitted for intravenous fluid resuscitation and antibiotic therapy. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis will be ordered to confirm the diagnosis and rule out any complications. Surgical consultation has been requested due to the severity of symptoms.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient will be closely monitored in the hospital for signs of perforation or sepsis. A surgical intervention may be necessary if her condition does not improve with antibiotics. The patient should expect frequent assessments and laboratory tests during her hospital stay. Follow-up appointments will be scheduled upon discharge to monitor recovery and ensure proper healing.
