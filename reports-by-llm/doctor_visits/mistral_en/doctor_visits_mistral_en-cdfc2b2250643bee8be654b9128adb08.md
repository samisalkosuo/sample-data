Severity Level: 2 (Emergent)
Patient Gender: Female
Patient Age: 54

Chief Complaint:
Acute abdominal pain and vomiting

History of Present Illness (HPI):
The patient presented to the emergency department with a sudden onset of severe, constant abdominal pain localized primarily in the lower right quadrant. The pain began approximately 6 hours ago and has been accompanied by repeated episodes of non-bloody vomiting. The pain is exacerbated by movement and deep breathing, and the patient reports feeling nauseous and lightheaded. She denies any history of trauma or recent surgery.

Physical Examination Findings:
Vital signs: Blood pressure 140/90 mmHg, pulse 110 bpm, respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, temperature 37.5°C (99.5°F). On abdominal examination, there is localized tenderness and guarding in the lower right quadrant with rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds are hypoactive. No signs of peritonitis were observed.

Assessment / Diagnosis:
The patient's presentation suggests an acute appendicitis based on the location, severity, and characteristics of the abdominal pain, along with the physical examination findings.

Plan / Treatment:
The patient will be admitted for further evaluation and management. Initial treatment includes intravenous fluid resuscitation, analgesia, and antibiotics to cover common appendicular pathogens. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis will be performed to confirm the diagnosis and assess for any complications such as perforation or abscess formation.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient will be closely monitored in the hospital, with plans for surgical intervention if the CT scan confirms appendicitis. The surgeon will discuss the specifics of the procedure and postoperative care. Follow-up appointments will be scheduled as needed to monitor recovery and address any concerns.
