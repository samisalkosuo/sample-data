Chief Complaint: Acute shortness of breath and chest pain

History of Present Illness (HPI): The patient, a 76-year-old male, presented to the emergency department with complaints of sudden onset of severe shortness of breath and sharp, persistent chest pain that radiates to his left arm. He reports experiencing these symptoms for approximately 2 hours prior to arrival. The patient also mentions feeling lightheaded and profuse sweating. He denies any recent trauma or known allergies.

Physical Examination Findings: Upon initial assessment, the patient appears anxious and in distress. Vital signs reveal a heart rate of 130 bpm, blood pressure of 140/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 92% on room air, and temperature of 37.2°C (99°F). Auscultation of the chest reveals diminished breath sounds and a systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border.

Assessment / Diagnosis: Given the patient's age, acute symptoms, and physical examination findings, there is a high suspicion for an acute coronary syndrome, such as a myocardial infarction (heart attack).

Plan / Treatment: The patient was immediately started on oxygen therapy at 4 L/min via nasal cannula. A 12-lead ECG was obtained and showed ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads, confirming a diagnosis of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The patient was promptly transferred to the cardiac catheterization laboratory for urgent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent placement.

Follow-up Instructions: Post-procedure, the patient will be admitted to the cardiac care unit for close monitoring and management of any complications. A follow-up appointment with a cardiologist will be scheduled within one week for further evaluation and medication adjustments. The patient is advised to maintain a heart-healthy diet, engage in regular exercise, and avoid smoking. He should also take prescribed medications as directed and return for routine follow-ups as scheduled.
