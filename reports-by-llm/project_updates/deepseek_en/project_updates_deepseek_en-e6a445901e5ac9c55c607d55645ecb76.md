**Quarterly Project Update Report: DevOps Toolchain Rollout**

** synthesized by SynapseTech **

---

### Executive Summary

The DevOps Toolchain Rollout project is currently in the Procurement phase, with significant progress made towards standardizing and automating our DevOps processes. The team has successfully completed key milestones, including stakeholder discovery, tool selection, and initial setup activities. While we are on track to meet our project objectives, there are a few areas where additional focus may be required to ensure full success.

### Key Milestones Achieved

- **Discovery Phase Completed**: All key stakeholders have been engaged, and initial meetings scheduled for the next phase of the rollout.
- **Tool Selection**: Tools such as AWS and Azure for CI/CD have been selected and are in place. These tools will significantly streamline our development workflows.
- **Data Quality Assessment**: 65% of the data quality assessment has been completed, with a focus on identifying inconsistencies across our systems.

### Current Risks and Blockers

- **Data Quality Issues**: The use of multiple disparate tools to collect and store data has led to inconsistencies. While we have implemented manual checks, this is not sufficient for large-scale processes.
- **Vendor Lock-In**: Our reliance on AWS and Azure may limit flexibility in the future. We are exploring alternative solutions to mitigate this risk.

### Next Quarter Objectives

In the coming quarter, our focus will be on finalizing the data quality assessment and implementing it across all CI/CD pipelines by mid-quarter. Additionally, we aim to begin training our development teams on these new tools to ensure a smooth transition.

### Resource and Budget Overview

Our current resources are well-utilized as we progress through this phase of the project. However, additional staff will be required for data quality assessment tasks due to their complexity. The budget is tight, but we have successfully managed costs so far. Moving forward, we expect to incur significant expenses related to external contractors for data quality assessment and training.

This report reflects our current status and priorities as we continue to execute the DevOps Toolchain Rollout project. We are committed to addressing any challenges and ensuring a successful transition to standardized processes.
