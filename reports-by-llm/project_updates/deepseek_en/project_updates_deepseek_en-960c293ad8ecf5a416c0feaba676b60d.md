### **Current Risks and Blockers**

Despite significant progress, several risks and blockers remain:  

1. **Equipment Shortages in Specialized Trades:**  
   - **Challenge:** A limited supply of specialized construction equipment has hindered progress on certain subprojects, such as the installation of advanced signaling systems at the interchange.  
   - **Management Strategy:** The project team is actively exploring alternative suppliers and negotiating longer-term contracts with existing vendors to ensure timely delivery of required materials.

2. **Supply Chain Delays for Exterior Finishing Materials:**  
   - **Challenge:** Delays in obtaining high-quality exterior cladding materials have impacted the timeline for finalizing the building’s facades.  
   - **Management Strategy:** The company is working closely with local suppliers to expedite deliveries and explore alternative material options that meet project specifications.

3. **Weather Conditions:**  
   - **Challenge:** Continued light rain showers in the region have caused minor delays in outdoor construction activities, particularly during the final stages of grading and landscaping.  
   - **Management Strategy:** The team is monitoring weather forecasts closely and has implemented measures to mitigate risks, such as delayed start times for outdoor work.
