### Executive Summary

The Customer Self-Service Portal Upgrade project is progressing steadily through the Procurement phase. The organization has successfully completed key milestones such as vendor selection and the formation of a steering committee. The team is on track to meet its objectives but faces minor challenges that are being actively managed. Overall sentiment remains optimistic, with a focus on ensuring a smooth transition to execution.

### Key Milestones Achieved

- **Vendor Selection:** Completed 30% of the process, shortlisted three vendors based on technical expertise and past performance.
- **Steering Committee Formation:** 100% achieved; the committee is well-prepared for discussions on vendor selection and project planning.
- **Initial Testing Framework Development:** 30% implemented to ensure compatibility with existing systems.

### Current Risks and Blockers

The primary risks include insufficient training for the technical team, which could impact system integration. This is being addressed by providing comprehensive training modules. Another blocker is vendor collaboration issues due to unclear contracts; this is mitigated by reviewing contracts and setting up regular meetings.

### Next Quarter Objectives

- **Completion of Development:** Finalize portal development by end of Q3.
- **Vendor Onboarding:** Complete due diligence on selected vendors in mid-Q4.
- **Testing Framework Completion:** Wrap up testing framework by end of Q4.
- **User Trials Initiation:** Start user trials in late Q4 to gather feedback.

### Resource and Budget Overview

The project budget allocation is as follows:

- **Total Allocated:** $5,000,000
- **Used:** 60% ($3,000,000)
- **Remaining:** 40% ($2,000,000)

Staffing levels are adequate but require a 20% increase to accommodate increased responsibilities. Vendor collaboration is on track with all contracts signed and discussions underway.
