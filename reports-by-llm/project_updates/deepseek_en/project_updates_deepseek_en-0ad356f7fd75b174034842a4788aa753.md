### Executive Summary

In Q2 2024, the AeronauticsTech Airport Baggage System Upgrade project is progressing steadily towards full deployment. The team has achieved significant milestones this quarter, with key deliverables completed and testing phases underway. Despite minor delays in stakeholder alignment, the project remains on track to meet its deadlines. We are confident that by addressing current challenges proactively, we will successfully deploy the new baggage system by the end of Q4 2024.

### Key Milestones Achieved

1. **Integration Completion:** The integration of new baggage scanners with airport systems was completed at 95%, enhancing operational efficiency.
   
2. **Testing Phases:** Testing phases are 85% complete, including functional testing and user acceptance testing (UAT). This phase is critical for ensuring the system meets all regulatory standards.

3. **User Training:** Initial training sessions for airport staff have been completed with 90% attendance rates, setting a foundation for full system adoption.

### Current Risks and Blockers
