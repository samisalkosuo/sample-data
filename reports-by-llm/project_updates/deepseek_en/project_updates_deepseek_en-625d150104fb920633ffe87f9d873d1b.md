**PharMHold Inc. Quarterly Project Update Report: Drug Manufacturing Quality System**

---

**Executive Summary**

PharMHold Inc.'s Drug Manufacturing Quality System project, aimed at enhancing process validation and regulatory compliance in the pharmaceutical sector, has reached 80% completion as of Q2 2025. While the project is nearing its closure, it remains slightly behind schedule due to ongoing integration challenges between internal systems and a third-party vendor. Despite these delays, significant progress has been made towards achieving key milestones, with a strong alignment on remaining objectives.

**Key Milestones Achieved**

- **Completion of Deliverables:** 80% of the project deliverables have been successfully completed, including updated documentation and the establishment of a dedicated test environment for quality assurance processes.
- **Impact on Company Goals:** These achievements align closely with PharMHold's internal goals, ensuring that testing and QA processes are now operational. This milestone is crucial as it paves the way for finalizing project handover to clients.

**Current Risks and Blockers**

Integration issues persist as a major blocker, delaying the resolution of discrepancies between PharMHold's in-house systems and those provided by the third-party vendor. These challenges require additional time to resolve before project closure. Regulatory compliance aspects are also under scrutiny, with pending approvals from key authorities such as the FDA and EMA.

**Next Quarter Objectives**

Given the project's proximity to completion, the focus will shift towards finalizing documentation and preparing for handover to clients. Additionally, PharMHold may consider initiating post-implementation support if required by client feedback or regulatory demands.

**Resource and Budget Overview**

PharMHold has allocated 70% of its budget to this project, with expenditures primarily on software licenses and third-party vendor integration. Staffing remains efficient, though there is an opportunity for resource optimization as the project nears completion. Vendor collaboration will continue to be crucial in addressing remaining integration challenges.
