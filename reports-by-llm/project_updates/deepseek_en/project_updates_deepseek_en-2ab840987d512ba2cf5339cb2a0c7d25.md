### Executive Summary

The New Logistics Center Build project, a state-of-the-art construction initiative by LogiConstr Inc., is progressing steadily through its Deployment phase. As of Q4 2025, significant milestones have been achieved, with key deliverables on track to meet the agreed-upon deadlines. The project is expected to remain within budget and align with company goals, though some challenges persist that are being actively managed.

### Key Milestones Achieved

- **Structural Work:** Completed at 75% of the target timeline, exceeding expectations and contributing to cost savings by reducing delays.
- **Foundation Work:** 80% delivered on schedule, ensuring a solid foundation for future phases.
- **Electrical Systems:** 60% installed, with minimal disruption to operations.
- **Mechanical Systems:** 45% completed, aligning with the project's timeline.

These milestones have positively impacted company goals, reinforcing the project's successful execution phase.

### Current Risks and Blockers

A notable blocker is the delayed procurement of materials due to supplier issues, causing a 10-12 week delay. Additionally, labor shortages for specialized trades are affecting progress slightly. LogiConstr is addressing these by exploring alternative suppliers and increasing overtime pay rates with unions' approval.

### Next Quarter Objectives

The objectives for Q4 focus on accelerating the remaining phases:

- **Structural Work:** Complete in the first week of Q4.
- **Foundation Work:** Finalize by mid-quarter.
- **Electrical Systems:** Install by end of Q3.
- **Mechanical Systems:** Install early Q4.
- **Testing and Commissioning:** Conduct final testing by mid-Q4.

These goals aim to wrap up the project ahead of schedule, ensuring timely delivery and operational readiness.

### Resource and Budget Overview

Budget usage is at 60%, with potential cost overruns due to delayed material deliveries. Staffing includes increased hours for specialized teams and contractor involvement. Vendor collaboration has been positive, though dependencies on timely deliveries remain a risk.
