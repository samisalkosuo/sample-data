### Executive Summary

The Wealth Management Suite Deployment project is progressing steadily toward its goal of delivering a comprehensive digital transformation solution for our client. As we approach the end of Q3 2025, we are in the final stages of Requirements Gathering (RG), which has been a critical phase to ensure alignment with business objectives and stakeholder expectations.

The team has made significant progress this quarter, completing key deliverables that form the foundation of the project's success. However, we remain vigilant about potential delays, particularly in third-party audits, which are critical for ensuring data security and compliance. By engaging stakeholders early and maintaining open communication, we have managed to mitigate these risks effectively.

This report outlines our current status, recent achievements, ongoing challenges, and future objectives for Q4 2025.
