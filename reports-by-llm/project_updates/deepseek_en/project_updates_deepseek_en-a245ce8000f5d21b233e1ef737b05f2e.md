### Executive Summary

The Lumina Tower high-rise residential project is nearing its midpoint in the Monitoring & Evaluation phase of construction. As of Q4 2025, the project has achieved significant milestones with approximately 60% completion. Key deliverables include structural work (80%), foundation installation (75%), exterior facades (90%), HVAC systems (85%), electrical installations (70%), plumbing fixtures (70%), and interior finishes (40%). Despite these advancements, the project is currently experiencing minor delays due to weather-related disruptions. However, the team remains proactive by utilizing temporary structures to mitigate these challenges.

### Key Milestones Achieved

- **Structural Work**: Completed 80% of the foundation and framework.
- **Foundation Installation**: 75% of the concrete slab and footings are in place.
- **Exterior Facades**: 90% of the cladding panels installed, with a focus on energy efficiency.
- **HVAC Systems**: 85% of units equipped with new air conditioning systems.
- **Electrical Installations**: 70% of electrical panels and circuits installed.
- **Plumbing Fixtures**: 70% of fixtures installed to meet safety and sustainability standards.

These milestones align closely with the company's strategic goals, ensuring steady progress toward project completion. The interior finish phase is expected to be completed in Q1 2026.

### Current Risks and Blockers

Weather-related delays persist, affecting structural work schedules. To address this, the team has implemented temporary structures for outdoor work areas, minimizing disruptions. Additionally, supply chain issues have led to minor shortages of materials such as steel beams and drywall. The project management team is working closely with vendors to secure alternative suppliers and adjust timelines accordingly.

### Next Quarter Objectives

Q1 2026 will focus on completing the remaining structural components (20% of foundation and framework) and finalizing interior finishes (60%). Once these are achieved, the project aims to transition into handover in Q2 2026. Staffing will include hiring additional laborers and engineers to meet deadlines.

### Resource and Budget Overview

Budget usage remains within projected parameters, with 45% allocated for structural materials, 30% for labor, 15% for vendors, and 10% reserved for unforeseen expenses. Staffing is optimized with full-time project managers and laborers, with potential adjustments to overtime hours if needed. Vendor collaboration continues smoothly, though minor delays in material delivery are being managed by securing alternative suppliers.
