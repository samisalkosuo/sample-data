### Executive Summary

The Water Treatment Plant Renovation project is progressing steadily toward completion. As of the end of Q2 2025, we are ahead of schedule with approximately 70% of deliverables completed. The project's milestones include the installation and testing of critical components such as the control room upgrade (85%), automation system integration (60%), and commissioning tests (40%). These achievements align well with our long-term goals to enhance operational efficiency and ensure compliance with environmental regulations.

While we are on track, post-deployment activities remain a focus. We continue to monitor risks, particularly vendor delays, which have been managed effectively through backup vendors. This proactive approach ensures minimal disruption to operations.

### Key Milestones Achieved

- **Control Room Upgrade:** 85% completed, with all electrical and plumbing work finalized.
- **Automation Integration:** 60% achieved, incorporating advanced monitoring systems.
- **Commissioning Tests:** 40% conducted successfully, ensuring system reliability.

These milestones contribute significantly to our company's strategic objectives of operational excellence and regulatory compliance.

### Current Risks and Blockers

A notable blocker is the delay in obtaining permits from a key vendor. To mitigate this, we are working closely with alternative vendors who have provided timely solutions. This proactive approach ensures that project timelines remain intact despite minor setbacks.

### Next Quarter Objectives

For Q3 2025, our focus will be on post-deployment activities:

- **Decommissioning:** Complete the final stages by mid-Q3.
- **Staff Training:** Finalize all training programs to ensure smooth transition to maintenance tasks.
- **Maintenance Tasks:** Address minor issues and prepare for future expansions.

### Resource and Budget Overview

Resource utilization is efficient, with 75% of allocated budget already spent. Staffing remains stable, avoiding layoffs while ensuring adequate coverage during decommissioning. Vendor collaboration has been smooth except for one delay, which was resolved promptly without impacting project timelines.

Looking ahead, we plan to allocate additional resources for future projects, including expansion efforts and advanced monitoring systems.

### Conclusion

Greenwater Innovations Inc. is committed to delivering a successful Water Treatment Plant Renovation.
