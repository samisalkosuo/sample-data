### Executive Summary

The Water Treatment Plant Renovation project is progressing steadily through the Procurement stage. The organization has secured most of its vendors and is in the final stages of due diligence, with a few remaining approvals pending. Despite delays in securing two key vendors, the project remains on track to meet the Q3 timeline for vendor contract signings.
