### **Executive Summary**

The Claims Automation Engine (CAE) project is progressing steadily through the System Integration phase. As of Q2 2025, we are approximately 40% complete, with key milestones achieved in Data Validation and Initial Testing. The team remains on track to meet our target completion date for this phase by the end of Q3. While challenges such as budget overruns persist, proactive measures like scope adjustments and cost-saving initiatives have helped mitigate these issues. Sentiment among stakeholders is positive, with a focus on delivering value aligned with strategic objectives.

### **Key Milestones Achieved**

- **Data Validation Module:** Completed 100% in Q2.
- **Initial Testing:** Completed 85%, with all functional tests passed.
- **API Integrations:** Partially integrated with three major vendors, achieving 70% completion.

These milestones have significantly enhanced the system's efficiency and reduced operational costs, supporting our goal to streamline claims processing without increasing expenses.

### **Current Risks and Blockers**

1. **Budget Overruns:** The initial budget of $2.5 million has been exceeded by approximately 15%. To address this, we've implemented scope adjustments and are leveraging cost-saving measures such as remote work for non-critical tasks.
   
2. **Vendor Integration Delays:** Integration with new vendors is causing delays due to differing API standards. However, early access to API documentation has allowed us to begin custom modifications.

### **Next Quarter Objectives**

- **Complete Remaining Modules:**
  - Fraud Detection Module: Expected to be completed by the end of Q3.
  - Full Testing: Targeted for completion in late Q3.

- **Vendor Integration:** Finalize integration with all vendors, aiming for completion by mid-Q4.

- **System Testing:** Conduct comprehensive testing across all modules to ensure reliability and performance.

### **Resource and Budget Overview**

**Resources:**  
The project team has allocated 15% more resources to System Integration, focusing on dedicated teams for each phase. This includes a dedicated QA team to oversee testing phases.

**Budget:**  
Current expenditure is $2 million, with the remaining budget reserved for contingency planning. Vendor collaboration remains smooth, though we are closely monitoring costs to ensure alignment with financial goals.

This structured approach ensures that we remain aligned with project objectives while addressing potential challenges effectively.
