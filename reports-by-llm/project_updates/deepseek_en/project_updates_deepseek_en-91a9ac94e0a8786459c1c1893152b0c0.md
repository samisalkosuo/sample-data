### Current Risks and Blockers

The primary blocker to project progress is the lack of consistent executive support for ongoing post-deployment activities. To address this, the team has initiated regular updates with key stakeholders, including the government minister responsible for digital governance. Adjustments have been made to the project timeline to accommodate these meetings without impacting the overall delivery schedule.
