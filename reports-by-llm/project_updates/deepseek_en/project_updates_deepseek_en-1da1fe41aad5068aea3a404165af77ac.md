### Executive Summary

PharMHold'em Pharmaceuticals is progressing steadily toward the successful implementation of our Quality System for Drug Manufacturing. The project, which began in Q4 2022 with the objective of establishing a robust Quality Management System (QMS), has now reached the critical phase of System Integration. As of this report, we have completed approximately 70% of the integration tasks, aligning us on track to meet our Q3 2023 deadline for full system deployment.

While the project is progressing as planned, we remain vigilant due to ongoing budget constraints and regulatory approvals for certain modules. These challenges are being managed effectively through proactive planning and resource allocation.
