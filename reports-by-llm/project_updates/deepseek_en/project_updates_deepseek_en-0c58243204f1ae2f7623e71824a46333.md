### **Current Risks and Blockers**

1. **Data Quality Issues**: A minor issue has been identified during the data migration phase where certain datasets contained anomalies or inconsistencies that could affect system accuracy. The team is actively working with the IT department to validate and clean these datasets before final deployment in Q3 2024.

2. **Vendor Integration Delays**: Slight delays in integrating third-party software components into the OMS platform are being closely monitored. These delays are expected to be resolved within the current quarter as additional resources are allocated to this effort.

**Mitigation Strategies**:  
- Data quality issues are being addressed proactively by validating datasets and refining data validation processes prior to migration.
- Vendor integration is being prioritized, with additional staff assigned to ensure timely resolution of any remaining challenges.
