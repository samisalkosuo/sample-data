### Current Risks and Blockers

A notable blocker this quarter is a delay in procuring critical vendor collaborations due to complex contract negotiations. This has pushed back timelines by 5% for related tasks. To mitigate this, we are exploring alternative vendors with shorter lead times but similar capabilities.

Another risk involves data migration compatibility issues between the existing system and new modules. We have implemented contingency plans, including cross-training support teams and accelerated testing phases to ensure a smooth transition.
