### Executive Summary

MediCore Technologies is currently in the Testing phase of our Electronic Health Record (EHR) migration project. The project, which began in late Q1 2024, aims to streamline healthcare data management and improve patient care efficiency. As of now, we are approximately 60% through the Testing phase.

Key progress points include the completion of data migration setup and initial testing phases for critical functionalities such as patient records integration and system compatibility checks. However, challenges like staff turnover in our development team remain a significant blocker, impacting timelines slightly but manageable with strategic planning.

We are on track to meet our Q2 milestones, though we must remain vigilant about potential delays from staffing issues and ensure thorough testing before the final go-live phase.
