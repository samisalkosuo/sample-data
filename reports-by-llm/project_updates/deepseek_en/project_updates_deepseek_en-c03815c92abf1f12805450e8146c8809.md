### **Key Milestones Achieved**

1. **Preliminary Design Work**:  
   - The design phase has been completed to 30%, focusing on optimizing water treatment processes and integrating energy-efficient technologies. This phase is critical for ensuring compliance with industry standards and regulatory requirements.

2. **Contract Negotiations**:  
   - Contracts have been finalized with three key suppliers, covering essential materials such as pumps, filters, and control systems. These agreements are expected to reduce costs by 10% compared to the original estimates.

3. **Project Planning**:  
   - A detailed project plan has been developed, outlining timelines for each phase of construction activities. This ensures that all stakeholders are aligned and resources are allocated efficiently.

### **Current Risks and Blockers**

One of the primary risks in this project is the delay in securing contracts due to complex procurement processes. While the team has secured contracts with three major suppliers, delays in finalizing agreements with additional vendors could impact timelines. To mitigate this risk, Greenwater Innovations has established contingency plans, including alternative sourcing strategies and expedited negotiations.

Another potential blocker is the availability of specialized labor required for construction activities. The company is actively recruiting skilled workers through partnerships with local training programs and industry networks to ensure a steady workforce during the renovation phase.
