As of Q1 2024, the RetailSphere POS System Replacement project is progressing steadily with a focus on integration and staff training. The project is currently at 35% completion, maintaining overall momentum without significant delays. We remain confident in our timeline, though we are closely monitoring Procurement delays to ensure timely delivery.

### **Key Milestones Achieved**

These milestones align well with our goal to modernize our POS systems, improving efficiency and customer experience.

### **Current Risks and Blockers**

A Procurement delay has pushed back some components. We are addressing this by exploring alternative suppliers and accelerating the review process for necessary parts. Additionally, data migration issues have been mitigated through thorough testing phases.

### **Next Quarter Objectives**

Q2 focuses on finalizing integration testing, completing staff training in Q3, launching the new system by year-end, and initiating post-implementation support to ensure smooth operations.

### **Resource and Budget Overview**

Budget usage is as planned with minor adjustments for additional resources. IT and HR costs are increasing due to project demands but managed through cost-saving measures like remote work during training sessions.
