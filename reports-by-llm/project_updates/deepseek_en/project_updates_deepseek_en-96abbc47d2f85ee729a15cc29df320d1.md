**Executive Summary**

As of Q3 2024, the MediCore Solutions EHR Migration project is progressing steadily through its Design Phase. The team has successfully completed foundational planning and initial design activities, with a focus on setting up the project structure and documentation. While we are on track to meet our deadlines, minor delays in regulatory approvals have slightly impacted our timeline. Overall sentiment remains positive, with the team motivated to overcome challenges and ensure successful project execution.

**Key Milestones Achieved**

1. **High-Level Architecture Design**: Completed and shared with stakeholders, this milestone represents 40% of the Design Phase objectives.
2. **User Story Development**: Initiated user story creation for key functionalities, achieving 35% completion.
   
These milestones contribute significantly to aligning our project with strategic goals, ensuring a smooth transition to the new EHR system.

**Current Risks and Blockers**

A primary blocker is the regulatory approval process, which has caused slight delays. To mitigate this, we are actively coordinating with relevant agencies and preparing contingency plans for potential extensions of timelines if approvals take longer than anticipated.

**Next Quarter Objectives**

For Q4 2024, our objectives include:

1. **Detailed Architecture Design**: Finalizing detailed architectural diagrams (80% completion).
2. **User Story Refinement**: Completing user story documents by the end of the quarter.
3. **Wireframing**: Starting wireframing for core components within 3-4 weeks.

These goals aim to solidify our design foundation, ensuring a robust and scalable migration process.

**Resource and Budget Overview**

Budget usage is on track with allocated funds, with an additional $50,000 reserved for potential delays in regulatory approvals. Staffing includes hiring two new designers and a project manager, while vendor collaboration focuses on selecting tools for the migration. Dependencies include pending software releases, which are being closely monitored.
