### Executive Summary

The PowerGrid Resilience Upgrade project, led by PowerGen USA, is currently in the initiation phase with a focus on laying the groundwork for a comprehensive grid resilience strategy. As of Q2 2023, the project is progressing steadily but remains slightly behind schedule due to initial stakeholder misalignment and unclear objectives. However, all key milestones are on track to meet the company's strategic goals by the end of the year.

### Key Milestones Achieved

1. **Feasibility Study Completion**: The first phase of the feasibility study has been successfully completed, providing a detailed analysis of current grid resilience measures and identifying critical areas for improvement.
2. **Stakeholder Engagement Plan**: A preliminary stakeholder engagement plan has been drafted to align key stakeholders with project objectives and timelines.

### Current Risks and Blockers

1. **Complete Feasibility Study**: Finalize the feasibility study by June 2023.
2. **Finalize Stakeholder Engagement Plan**: Complete stakeholder engagement activities by July 2023.
3. **Set Up Project Management Structure**: Establish a project management framework with assigned responsibilities and timelines.

### Resource and Budget Overview
