### Executive Summary

As of Q3 2025, the Cybersecurity Modernization Program is progressing steadily towards its objectives. The project, managed by SecureNet Solutions, has achieved significant milestones in integrating advanced threat detection systems and implementing encryption protocols, contributing substantially to our company's cybersecurity goals. However, we are currently facing minor delays due to vendor issues, which have pushed us slightly behind schedule but remain manageable with proactive mitigation strategies.

### Key Milestones Achieved
