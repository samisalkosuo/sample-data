Labor shortages in specialized trades are also impacting progress, but we have successfully sourced additional vendors to mitigate these risks.

Additionally, we aim to enhance sustainability features in modular housing units as part of our commitment to environmental standards. Staffing challenges are anticipated but will be addressed by securing short-term contracts.

### **Resource and Budget Overview**

Resource utilization is efficient with current staffing supporting project timelines. The budget remains within expectations, having spent $25M out of the allocated $60M. Vendor collaboration has been smooth, though we remain vigilant for any potential cost overruns in the remaining budget focused on sustainability enhancements.
