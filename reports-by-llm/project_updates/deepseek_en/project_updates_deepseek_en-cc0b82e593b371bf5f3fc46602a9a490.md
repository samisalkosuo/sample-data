### **Executive Summary**

The Smart Grid Rollout project for GreenPower Energy Solutions is in its Initiation phase, with significant focus on laying the groundwork to ensure a successful deployment. The project team has successfully engaged key stakeholders and established communication channels. Key progress points include the formation of the steering committee, vendor selection processes, and initial stakeholder engagement activities. Overall sentiment among stakeholders is positive, with everyone aligned to achieve the project objectives.

### **Key Milestones Achieved**

- **Project Planning:** 30% completion of detailed project planning documents, including timelines, resource allocation, and risk assessments.

### **Current Risks and Blockers**

A primary blocker is supply chain instability affecting the timely delivery of smart meters and inverters. To mitigate this risk, GreenPower has entered into long-term contracts with preferred vendors and maintains a contingency plan to source components from alternative suppliers if necessary. Additionally, ongoing discussions with stakeholders are essential to ensure alignment on timelines and expectations.

These objectives are expected to be completed by the end of Q2 2023.
