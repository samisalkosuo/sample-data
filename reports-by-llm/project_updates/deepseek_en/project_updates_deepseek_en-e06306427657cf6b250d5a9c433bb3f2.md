- **User Training Materials:** Comprehensive training materials are ready, with 98% of participants completing the orientation without issues.

### Current Risks and Blockers

A minor risk identified is delays in obtaining final government approvals for testing phases. However, this has been mitigated by expedited communication with stakeholders and securing necessary permissions promptly. Vendor dependencies, such as data migration services, are being closely monitored to ensure timely delivery without compromising project timelines.

### Next Quarter Objectives

For Q3 2023, the following objectives are set:

- **Final Testing:** Complete remaining testing phases, including user acceptance testing (UAT), by the end of Q3.
- **User Training:** Finalize and distribute updated training materials to all participants in anticipation of full system implementation.
- **Monitoring Tools:** Implement automated monitoring tools to track system performance post-deployment.

### Resource and Budget Overview

Resource allocation remains stable, with dedicated teams handling data migration, integration testing, and user training. The budget has shown a slight variance due to unexpected vendor delays, but overall expenditure is within projected limits. staffing levels are maintained at optimal to ensure project continuity without overburdening the team.

Vendor collaboration is crucial for timely data migration; any delays will be closely monitored with external partners. Dependencies on these vendors will be managed proactively to avoid project bottlenecks.
