**Quarterly Project Update Report: Smart Meter Installation Project - Q3 2023**

---

**Executive Summary**

The Smart Meter Installation project for PowerGenX Energy Solutions is progressing steadily, nearing its deployment phase. Despite challenges such as Procurement delays and supply chain disruptions affecting timelines, the team remains on track to meet key milestones. Positive indicators include enhanced customer satisfaction due to improved service quality, driven by streamlined meter readings via the updated system.

**Key Milestones Achieved**

- **75% of Smart Meters Roll-out Completed**: 75% of meters have been installed across selected regions.
- **60% Data Collection Systems Deployed**: 60% of data collection systems are operational, supporting efficient monitoring and reporting.
- **85% Monitoring Software Deployed**: The deployment phase for the monitoring software is 85%, ensuring robust performance post-installation.
- **92% Testing Completed**: 92% of components have been tested successfully, with only minor adjustments pending.

**Current Risks and Blockers**

The primary blocker remains Procurement delays, particularly in obtaining specialized parts. However, the team has engaged with suppliers to expedite deliveries. Additionally, data security concerns were addressed by implementing enhanced encryption protocols last quarter. Vendor collaboration is ongoing despite initial resistance, ensuring timely delivery of critical components.

**Next Quarter Objectives**

Q4 objectives focus on finalizing deployment:

- **100% Smart Meter Roll-out**: Complete installation of all remaining meters.
- **Completion of Data Collection Systems**: Finalize the deployment of the last data collection systems.
- **Final Testing and Deployment of Monitoring Software**: Ensure all components are tested, with full deployment planned before year-end.

**Resource and Budget Overview**

Budget usage is within expectations, though tight. Staffing remains adequate, with cross-training conducted to enhance proficiency in new systems. Vendor collaboration is effective despite delays, ensuring timely delivery of critical components. Dependencies include pending parts and regulatory approvals, which are being closely monitored for potential impacts on timelines.
