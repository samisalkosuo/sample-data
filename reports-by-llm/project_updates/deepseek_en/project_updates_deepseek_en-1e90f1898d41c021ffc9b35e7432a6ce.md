**Quarterly Project Update Report: SynapseTech Cloud Migration Project - Q2 2025**

---

### Executive Summary

The SynapseTech Cloud Migration Project is progressing steadily through the Requirements Gathering phase, with significant milestones achieved and a clear roadmap ahead. The project aims to migrate critical enterprise applications to a cloud-based infrastructure to enhance scalability, security, and efficiency. As of now, we have successfully completed 70% of our requirements gathering efforts, focusing on defining objectives, identifying high-priority features, and engaging stakeholders for feedback.

We are optimistic about the progress made so far, with the foundation laid for future phases such as Implementation and Testing. The team is well-prepared to address upcoming challenges, ensuring we remain on track to meet our project deadlines and deliverables.

### Key Milestones Achieved

- **Requirements Gathering**: 70% of requirements have been identified and documented.
- **Stakeholder Engagement**: Initial meetings with key stakeholders have been conducted, resulting in a comprehensive list of high-priority features.
- **Impact on Goals**: This phase is crucial for aligning the project with strategic objectives, ensuring that the cloud migration plan meets business needs.

### Current Risks and Blockers

A primary blocker is the regulatory approval process for migrating certain legacy systems. Delays in obtaining necessary approvals could impact timelines. To mitigate this, we are collaborating closely with legal teams to expedite approvals wherever possible. Additionally, maintaining open communication channels with stakeholders is essential to address any concerns promptly.

### Next Quarter Objectives

- **Feature Prioritization and Validation**: Validate requirements against stakeholder feedback to ensure alignment with business goals.
- **Technical Specifications**: Draft detailed technical specifications post-validation to guide the Implementation phase.
- **Stakeholder Feedback**: Anticipate mid-Q3 updates from stakeholders on feature prioritization.

### Resource and Budget Overview

Our current resource allocation is at 45%, covering both internal teams and external vendors. We have a dedicated team of 10 developers and project managers, with vendors like AWS and Azure already committed to supporting the migration process. As we move forward, we may need to adjust staffing levels based on workload projections.
