**Quarterly Project Update Report: Medicycle Pharmaceuticals Q2 2023**

---

**Executive Summary**

As we stand at the beginning of Q2 2023, our focus remains on laying a solid foundation for the successful implementation of the Quality Management System (QMS) in our Drug Manufacturing division. Despite being in the initiation phase, significant progress has been made to ensure that we are well-positioned to meet our project objectives.

The team is currently on track with key milestones, including the completion of an initial assessment of our existing quality system and the drafting of a comprehensive QMS manual. However, we recognize that this is just the first step in a multi-phase journey. The challenges ahead remain manageable, but they require careful attention to detail to ensure project success.

**Key Milestones Achieved**

- **Quality System Assessment:** 30% of our current quality system has been assessed and documented.
- **QMS Manual Drafting:** Approximately 25% of the QMS manual has been completed, with a focus on regulatory requirements and operational procedures.
- **Stakeholder Engagement:** Initial stakeholder engagement sessions have been successfully conducted, providing valuable insights into stakeholder expectations.

**Current Risks and Blockers**

While progress is being made, we acknowledge several risks that could impact our timeline:

1. **Procurement Delays:** The procurement of critical materials for the QMS implementation has been delayed due to supplier lead time issues.
2. **Internal Approval Process:** The approval process for key components of the QMS is currently bogged down by conflicting regulatory requirements and unclear internal procedures.

To mitigate these risks, we are exploring alternative suppliers as a temporary solution while awaiting new deliveries from our current partners. Additionally, we have initiated a preliminary approval matrix to streamline the regulatory compliance process.

**Next Quarter Objectives**

Looking ahead, our priorities for Q3 2023 include:

1. **Finalizing QMS Manual:** The team will focus on completing the remaining sections of the QMS manual by June 30th.
2. **Regulatory Compliance:** Ensuring that all regulatory approvals are submitted by September to avoid delays in the manufacturing process.
3. **Staff Training:** Starting a comprehensive training program for key personnel responsible for QMS implementation.

**Resource and Budget Overview**

Our current budget reflects ongoing efforts to establish the QMS framework:

- **External Consultants:** Approximately $15,000 has been spent on external consultants to guide us through the initial stages.
- **Internal Resources:** We are planning to allocate additional resources internally in the coming quarters to support our progress.
- **Vendor Collaboration:** Ongoing collaboration with key vendors is expected to continue, though we anticipate an increase in dependency once the QMS is fully operational.

**Conclusion**

While we face challenges that require attention, they are manageable with proactive planning and resource allocation. We remain committed to ensuring a smooth transition to the QMS implementation while maintaining our focus on stakeholder expectations and regulatory compliance.

Thank you for your continued support as we navigate this critical phase of our project.
