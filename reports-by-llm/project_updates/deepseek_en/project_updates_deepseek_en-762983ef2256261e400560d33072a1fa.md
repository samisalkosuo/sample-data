### Executive Summary

The POS System Replacement project for EcoRetail Solutions is currently in the Design Phase. The project aims to modernize our point-of-sale systems to enhance customer experience and operational efficiency. As of Q3 2024, we are progressing steadily with key milestones achieved, including the completion of initial feasibility studies and vendor selection discussions.

The project is on track, with minor delays due to regulatory approvals for third-party system integrations. Our team remains focused and proactive in addressing these challenges, ensuring minimal impact on our timeline and company goals.

### Key Milestones Achieved

   - Conducted comprehensive feasibility studies across retail segments to identify integration points with existing systems.

### Current Risks and Blockers

To mitigate these risks, we have implemented contingency plans, including phased system testing and alternative vendor options. Our team is closely monitoring progress to ensure timely approvals and minimal impact on operations.

This structured approach ensures we meet our project milestones while maintaining operational integrity. We remain committed to delivering a seamless POS system replacement that enhances customer experience and supports long-term growth.
