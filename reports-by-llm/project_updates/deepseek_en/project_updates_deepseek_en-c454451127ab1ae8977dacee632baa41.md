### **Executive Summary**

As we stand at the beginning of Q4 2025, the DevOps Toolchain Rollout project is in its initial stages. The initiative aims to modernize our development processes by integrating advanced automation and monitoring tools across all teams. While we are still in the initiation phase, significant progress has been made in laying the groundwork for a seamless transition.

The project is on track with our initial objectives, which include setting up the necessary infrastructure and ensuring that key tools such as Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, and AWS are operational. This foundational work will enable us to scale our DevOps practices effectively once further development is completed.

**General Sentiment:** The rollout is progressing smoothly, with high levels of stakeholder engagement and support. The initial setup phase has been executed efficiently, setting a positive tone for the remainder of the project.
