### **Executive Summary**

As of Q1 2023, the Campus WiFi Upgrade project is progressing steadily toward completion. The deployment phase has commenced, with significant milestones achieved in infrastructure setup and initial testing phases. However, integration challenges between the new system and existing infrastructure are causing minor delays. Overall, the project remains on track to meet its timeline, though some adjustments may be necessary to ensure seamless operations.

### **Key Milestones Achieved**

- **Infrastructure Setup:** 50% of the rollout completed, including deployment of high-capacity routers across selected campuses.
- **Testing Phase:** 30% of testing activities concluded with minimal issues reported; QA processes are optimized for efficiency.
- **Deployment Planning:** Detailed deployment plan finalized, aligning with Q2 execution.

### **Current Risks and Blockers**

Integration challenges persist due to compatibility issues between the new system and existing infrastructure. A workaround has been implemented temporarily but is causing minor performance hiccups. Additionally, limited testing capacity during deployment is affecting QA efficiency. These blockers are being managed through vendor collaboration and incremental integration testing.

### **Next Quarter Objectives**

Q2 2023 will focus on finalizing the deployment process across all campuses, ensuring minimal disruption to operations. Post-deployment, rigorous testing in Q3 will validate system performance and user experience. By Q4, full operational readiness is expected with a comprehensive training program for staff.

### **Resource and Budget Overview**

Budget utilization stands at 70%, with expenditures concentrated on deployment tools and staff augmentation. Staffing has expanded to include dedicated personnel for deployment and testing support. Vendor collaboration remains pivotal, ensuring timely delivery of components without delays.
