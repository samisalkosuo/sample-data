### Executive Summary

The Omnichannel Sales System Launch project is progressing steadily, with significant milestones achieved in Q2 2023. The system has been successfully integrated across all sales channels, and foundational training for the sales team is underway.

### Current Risks and Blockers

A notable blocker is insufficient training for the sales team. To address this, we are implementing weekly workshops led by senior developers to ensure a smooth transition. Additionally, data migration from legacy systems has encountered delays; we are mitigating this risk by conducting partial deployments first.

- Completing the remaining 30% of testing framework and implementing full-scale testing.
- Finalizing user guides for all sales channels to ensure ease of use.
- Launching targeted marketing campaigns to promote the new system.
- Collecting customer feedback within two weeks post-launch to refine future updates.

### Resource and Budget Overview

Budget utilization is on track, with 60% allocated towards software licensing, 25% towards training, and 15% dedicated to support services. Staffing includes full-time developers (4), part-time trainers (2), and contractors for testing (3).
