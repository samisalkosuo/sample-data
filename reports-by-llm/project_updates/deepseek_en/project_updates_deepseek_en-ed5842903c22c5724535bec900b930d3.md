### **Current Risks and Blockers**

A key blocker is the lack of consistent executive support for the project. To address this, we have initiated regular stakeholder meetings and provided updated progress reports quarterly. Additionally, a limited-time report review incentive has been introduced to encourage timely submissions from key personnel.

Another consideration is ensuring adequate staff resources as the team scales up its efforts in data extraction and analytics development. We are addressing this by allocating additional team members to critical tasks.
