**Executive Summary**

The POS System Replacement project for EcoRetail Solutions is progressing steadily, currently in the Requirements Gathering phase as scheduled. The project aims to enhance operational efficiency and customer experience through an updated POS system. As of Q4 2024, we have achieved significant milestones with minimal delays.

Key progress points include:
- Completion of 65% of requirements gathering activities.
