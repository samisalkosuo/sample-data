### **Executive Summary**

The Airport Baggage System Upgrade project for Skyline Transport Solutions is progressing steadily through the Implementation phase. The team has successfully completed design and testing phases, with deployment scheduled to begin in Q1 2024. Key milestones include the completion of system design (on time) and testing at 85% completion, with no issues identified so far.

However, challenges such as stakeholder misalignment are impacting communication efficiency. To address this, we have implemented weekly check-ins and utilized a dedicated project management tool to ensure alignment across all stakeholders.

### **Key Milestones Achieved**

- **Completed Deliverables:**
  - System Design: 100% completion (Delivered on time)
  - Testing: 85% completion (No issues reported)

- **Percentage of Completion:** 60%
- **Impact on Company Goals:** The project is aligned with our strategic objectives, supporting operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.

### **Current Risks and Blockers**

A primary blocker is stakeholder misalignment, particularly among some key parties who are not actively participating in communication. To mitigate this, we have:
- Established weekly check-ins for all stakeholders.
- Assigned a project manager to each stakeholder group to ensure alignment.

### **Next Quarter Objectives**

Q4 2023 objectives include:
1. Completing testing by week 3 and finalizing test reports.
2. Finalizing the deployment plan with vendors, ensuring all dependencies are met for timely launch in Q1 2024.

### **Resource and Budget Overview**

- **Budget Usage:** $2 million allocated so far out of a total budget of $4.5 million.
- **Staffing:** Tight staffing requirements have necessitated the use of contractors and remote teams to meet deadlines.
- **Vendor Collaboration:** Vendors are responsive, though additional detailed agreements are expected by Q1 2024.

**Conclusion:** The project is on track with minor adjustments to address stakeholder communication. Continued focus on timely delivery will ensure successful project completion in the next quarter.
