**Quarterly Project Update Report: Carbon Capture Pilot Project**  
**Date:** March 31, 2024  

---

### **Executive Summary**

The Carbon Capture Pilot Project (CCPP) is progressing steadily toward its Phase 2 objectives. The project, led by **EcoFlow Energy Solutions**, aims to demonstrate the viability of carbon capture technologies in the energy sector as part of our broader sustainability initiatives. As of Q1 2024, the project has successfully completed Phase 1, which included the installation and testing of a pilot-scale carbon capture system at one of our key facilities.  

The project is currently in the Post-Go-Live Support phase, with a focus on full system commissioning, operational testing, and monitoring. While we are making good progress, there are a few areas where additional effort is needed to ensure we meet our timeline and budget goals. Overall, the project remains on track to achieve its key objectives by the end of this year.

### **Key Milestones Achieved**

1. **System Installation:**  
   - 85% of the carbon capture system has been installed, including hardware components such as scrubbers, filters, and control systems.  
   - This milestone was achieved ahead of schedule due to efficient vendor deliveries and site teams working closely with local partners.

2. **Commissioning Testing:**  
   - 70% of the commissioning testing has been completed, covering operational parameters such as efficiency at different load levels and emissions reduction targets.  
   - Initial results indicate a significant reduction in CO2 emissions, aligning with our sustainability goals.

3. **Monitoring Infrastructure:**  
   - 60% of the monitoring infrastructure has been set up, including data collection systems and real-time analytics tools.  
   - This setup will enable continuous monitoring of system performance and compliance with regulatory standards.
