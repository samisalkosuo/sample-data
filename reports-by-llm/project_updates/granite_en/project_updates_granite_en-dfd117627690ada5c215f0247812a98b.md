**Executive Summary:**

The Campus WiFi Upgrade project, aimed at enhancing the digital learning experience for students and faculty, is progressing through the Testing phase. Overall, the project remains on track with the initial timeline, demonstrating resilience despite minor setbacks. Key milestones have been achieved, and the testing phase has commenced as planned. The project team's dedication and adaptability have ensured that we maintain a positive trajectory towards our objectives.

**Key Milestones Achieved:**

1. **Infrastructure Installation (80% completion):** The installation of new access points and network backbone infrastructure across all campus buildings is 80% complete. This achievement significantly improves network coverage, reducing dead zones and enhancing connectivity for over 95% of the campus areas.

2. **Network Configuration (100% completion):** The configuration of the new WiFi network has been completed, ensuring seamless integration with existing systems. This milestone directly supports our goal of providing a robust, reliable, and secure digital learning environment.

3. **Initial Testing (25% completion):** The initial testing phase has begun, focusing on critical areas such as high-density zones, outdoor spaces, and specialized labs. Preliminary results indicate improved performance metrics compared to the legacy system.

**Current Risks and Blockers:**

1. **Staff Turnover:** The project has experienced moderate staff turnover, impacting knowledge transfer and project momentum. To mitigate this risk, we have implemented a comprehensive onboarding process for new team members and are leveraging documentation and knowledge-sharing platforms to preserve institutional memory.

2. **Vendor Dependency:** Delays in receiving critical hardware components from vendors have caused minor schedule slips. We are actively engaging with vendors to expedite deliveries and exploring alternative suppliers for non-critical items to minimize future dependency risks.

**Next Quarter Objectives:**

1. **Complete Testing (Q1 2024):** Conduct comprehensive testing across all campus areas, addressing any identified issues and ensuring compliance with performance standards. Deliverable: Test reports and remediation plans.

2. **User Acceptance Testing (UAT) (Q2 2024):** Engage stakeholders for UAT, focusing on user experience and functionality. Deliverable: UAT feedback and final adjustments.

3. **Rollout Preparation (Q2 2024):** Develop a detailed rollout plan, including training materials and communication strategies for end-users. Deliverable: Rollout plan and training resources.

**Resource and Budget Overview:**

1. **Budget Usage:** As of Q3 2024, 75% of the allocated budget has been utilized, primarily for infrastructure installation, network configuration, and testing equipment. We remain within the approved budget, with contingency funds set aside to address unforeseen expenses related to vendor delays.

2. **Staffing:** The project team currently consists of 10 full-time equivalents, including network engineers, project managers, and technical writers. To support upcoming objectives, we plan to engage additional resources for testing and training activities in Q4 2024.

3. **Vendor Collaboration:** We maintain open communication channels with key vendors, ensuring timely resolution of issues and alignment on project milestones. Ongoing vendor management will prioritize proactive risk identification and mitigation strategies.

In conclusion, the Campus WiFi Upgrade project continues to advance steadily through its Testing phase, with a clear path towards successful implementation. The project team remains committed to delivering a state-of-the-art digital learning environment for Educational Institution Name's community.
