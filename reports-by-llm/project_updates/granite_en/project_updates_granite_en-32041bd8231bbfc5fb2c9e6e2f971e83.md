---

**Executive Summary**

Energize Future Solutions' Carbon Capture Pilot Project is progressing satisfactorily in its Post-Go-Live Support phase. The project remains on track, with key milestones achieved and ongoing efforts to address minor risks and blockers. Our commitment to innovation and environmental stewardship continues to drive positive momentum within the energy sector.

**Key Milestones Achieved**

1. **Pilot Plant Operation:** The carbon capture pilot plant has been operational since the end of Q1, successfully capturing CO2 from flue gas emissions at a rate of 95%. This milestone marks a significant step towards our goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the energy industry. (100% completion)

2. **Data Collection and Analysis:** We have gathered comprehensive data on CO2 capture efficiency, energy consumption, and process optimization. Initial analysis indicates that the technology meets our pre-project efficiency targets. This achievement directly supports EFS's strategic objective of developing commercially viable carbon capture solutions. (100% completion)

3. **Stakeholder Engagement:** We have successfully conducted multiple stakeholder meetings, including regulatory bodies, industry partners, and potential clients. These engagements have fostered collaboration and generated valuable feedback for further project refinement. (95% completion)

**Current Risks and Blockers**

1. **Regulatory Delays:** We are experiencing some delays in obtaining final regulatory approvals due to an unexpected change in local government. To mitigate this, we have initiated dialogue with relevant authorities and are exploring alternative pathways for expediting the approval process without compromising safety or compliance standards.

2. **Technology Optimization:** While our pilot plant is operational, there remains room for enhancing capture efficiency and reducing energy consumption. We are actively working on refining processes and exploring cutting-edge materials to optimize performance.

**Next Quarter Objectives**

1. **Regulatory Approval:** Secure final regulatory approvals by Q3 end, enabling full-scale deployment planning.

2. **Technology Refinement:** Achieve a 5% improvement in CO2 capture efficiency and reduce energy consumption by 10% through process optimization and material upgrades.

3. **Market Validation:** Conduct a series of demonstrations for potential clients to validate the technology's commercial viability and gather further market insights.

**Resource and Budget Overview**

- **Budget Usage:** We have adhered to the approved budget, with 70% allocated to operational expenses (staffing, materials, maintenance) and 30% reserved for contingencies and technology refinement.

- **Staffing:** Our dedicated project team of engineers, scientists, and support staff remains stable, ensuring continuity in project execution. We are also collaborating effectively with external vendors specializing in carbon capture technologies and materials.

- **Vendor Collaboration:** Relationships with key vendors are strong, with ongoing discussions to leverage their expertise for technology enhancements and cost reductions. Dependencies on these partnerships are closely monitored to ensure timely delivery of project objectives.

In conclusion, Energize Future Solutions' Carbon Capture Pilot Project is demonstrating robust progress in its Post-Go-Live Support phase. By addressing current challenges proactively and focusing on the next quarter's objectives, we aim to solidify our position as a leader in sustainable energy solutions.
