**Executive Summary**

Finance Innovations Inc. is currently in the Implementation phase of the Core Banking Platform Upgrade project, aimed at modernizing our banking infrastructure to enhance customer experience, improve operational efficiency, and ensure robust security measures. As we conclude Q1 2023, we are pleased to report that the project remains on track with significant progress made against key milestones.

**Key Milestones Achieved**

1. **System Architecture Design Completion (100%):** The new system architecture has been finalized and reviewed by stakeholders, ensuring alignment with business requirements and future scalability needs.
   
2. **Data Migration Plan Development (80%):** We have developed an intricate data migration plan, addressing over 90% of critical data entities. Testing on a subset of this data is underway to validate accuracy and integrity.

3. **Core Module Implementation (40%):** Initial implementation of core modules such as Account Management and Transaction Processing has commenced, with the first module expected to be fully operational by Q2 end.

**Current Risks and Blockers**

1. **Data Quality Issues:** During initial data audits, inconsistencies were identified across legacy systems. To mitigate this, we have initiated a comprehensive data cleansing process, prioritizing critical data sets. This effort is expected to be completed by Q2 end to ensure smooth migration.

2. **Integration Challenges with Legacy Systems:** Some unexpected complexities have emerged while integrating new modules with existing legacy applications. Our technical team is actively working on resolving these issues, and we anticipate a resolution within the next quarter.

**Next Quarter Objectives**

1. **Complete Data Migration Plan (Q2 End):** Finalize the data migration plan for all critical entities, ensuring zero data loss and integrity. Concurrently, conduct full-scale testing to validate migrated data against business rules.

2. **Full Core Module Implementation (Q3 End):** Achieve 100% implementation of core modules including Customer Relationship Management and Risk & Compliance. Conduct rigorous system testing to ensure functionality and performance meet standards.

3. **User Acceptance Testing (UAT) Initiation (Q3 Start):** Begin UAT with select business units to gather feedback and make necessary adjustments before the broader rollout.

**Resource and Budget Overview**

- **Budget Usage:** We have adhered to the approved budget, with 70% allocated to technology infrastructure, 20% for personnel costs, and 10% reserved for contingencies. Current expenditure is in line with projections, primarily focused on system implementation and data migration activities.
