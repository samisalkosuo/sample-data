**Resource and Budget Overview**

RGI has maintained a balanced approach to resource allocation, ensuring critical path activities receive necessary support while optimizing non-essential tasks. The project team currently consists of 15 full-time equivalents (FTEs) and several contractors, with vendor collaboration focused on specialized areas such as data analytics and cybersecurity.
