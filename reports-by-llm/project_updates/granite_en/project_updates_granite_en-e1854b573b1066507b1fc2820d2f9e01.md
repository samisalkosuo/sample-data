**Project Title:** Electronic Health Record (EHR) Migration

**Sponsoring Organization:** HealthMed Corporation

**Report Period:** Q4 2025

---

**Executive Summary**

HealthMed Corporation's EHR migration project is progressing through the Implementation phase, with a general sentiment of being on track. The project aims to transition from our legacy health information system to a modern, interoperable EHR platform. Key milestones have been achieved, and we are actively addressing emerging risks while maintaining focus on our strategic objectives.

**Key Milestones Achieved**

1. **System Configuration Completion:** 95% complete - The new EHR system's configuration has been finalized for all major clinical departments, ensuring tailored workflows and data structures that align with HealthMed’s operational needs.
   
2. **Data Migration Initiative:** 80% complete - Over 70% of patient records have been successfully migrated to the new system. We anticipate full completion by Q1 2026, with ongoing validation and reconciliation efforts ensuring data integrity.

3. **Integration with External Systems:** 50% complete - Initial integrations with key external systems such as laboratory information management (LIMS) and radiology picture archiving and communication systems (PACS) are underway, with plans to expand this integration suite in the coming quarters.

**Impact on Company Goals:**
The EHR migration project directly supports HealthMed’s strategic goal of enhancing patient care quality through improved data accessibility and clinical decision support. Early achievements have already begun to streamline workflows, reduce manual errors, and facilitate better interdisciplinary collaboration.

**Current Risks and Blockers**

1. **Insufficient Training:** A significant challenge identified is the adequate training of staff on the new EHR system. To mitigate this, we have increased the frequency and depth of training sessions, incorporated peer-to-peer learning, and developed comprehensive user manuals. Additionally, we are establishing a dedicated support team to address ongoing queries post-go-live.

2. **Data Validation Issues:** During data migration, inconsistencies were detected in certain patient records. We have engaged with our vendor to refine the data cleansing processes and implemented additional quality checks to ensure data accuracy before full system activation.

**Next Quarter Objectives**

1. **Complete Data Migration and Validation:** Aim to finalize the migration of all patient records by Q1 2026 end, ensuring comprehensive validation against source systems for accuracy.
   
2. **System Testing and User Acceptance Testing (UAT):** Conduct thorough system testing, including UAT with key stakeholders across departments to validate functionality and gather feedback for necessary adjustments before full rollout.

3. **Final Training and Communication Plan:** Finalize training programs and communication strategies to ensure all staff are prepared for the transition, addressing any lingering concerns or resistance.

**Resource and Budget Overview**

- **Budget Usage:** We have adhered to the approved budget, with 85% allocated to system configuration, data migration, and integration efforts. Remaining funds will be utilized for training, testing, and contingency planning.
  
- **Staffing:** The project team comprises dedicated internal staff and external vendor experts. We have maintained adequate resource levels, with plans to adjust as we move towards the go-live phase.

- **Vendor Collaboration:** Our primary EHR vendor has been responsive and supportive, actively engaging in issue resolution and process refinement. Ongoing collaboration ensures alignment with HealthMed’s specific requirements and timelines.

- **Dependencies:** Key dependencies include successful data validation, staff training readiness, and seamless integration with external systems. We are closely monitoring these areas to minimize potential disruptions.

In conclusion, the EHR migration project at HealthMed Corporation is advancing as planned, with a focus on overcoming identified risks and achieving critical milestones in the upcoming quarter. Our commitment remains steadfast to delivering a robust, efficient, and patient-centric electronic health record system that aligns with our strategic vision for enhanced healthcare delivery.
