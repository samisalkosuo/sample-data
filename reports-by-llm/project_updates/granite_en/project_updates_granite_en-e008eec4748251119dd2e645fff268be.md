**Executive Summary**

SecureGuard Insurance Holdings' Risk Modeling Platform Rollout project is progressing satisfactorily in its Post-Go-Live Support phase. The platform has been successfully deployed across key business units, and initial feedback indicates a positive reception from end-users. We are currently on track with our project timeline, having addressed most anticipated issues during the rollout.

**Key Milestones Achieved**

1. **Platform Deployment:** 100% completion. The Risk Modeling Platform has been successfully installed and configured in all targeted departments, including Underwriting, Claims, and Actuarial.
   
2. **User Training:** 85% of end-users have completed foundational training sessions. This achievement is crucial for ensuring that our workforce can effectively utilize the new platform to enhance risk assessment and decision-making processes.
   
3. **Data Migration:** 90% of critical data has been migrated from legacy systems to the Risk Modeling Platform, significantly improving data accessibility and accuracy for risk analysis.

**Current Risks and Blockers**

1. **Insufficient Training:** Despite 85% completion, there is a remaining 15% of end-users who have not yet completed training. This gap poses a moderate risk as it may lead to inefficient platform usage initially. To mitigate this, we are implementing a comprehensive follow-up training schedule and creating easily accessible online resources for self-paced learning.

2. **Integration with Legacy Systems:** While 90% of critical data has been migrated, integration with certain legacy systems is ongoing and presents a minor risk. We are working closely with IT to resolve these issues promptly to ensure seamless operation.

**Next Quarter Objectives**

1. **Complete User Training (Q2 Target):** Achieve 100% end-user training completion by Q2 end, ensuring all staff are proficient in using the Risk Modeling Platform.
   
2. **Full Data Migration and System Integration (Q2 Target):** Finalize data migration from remaining legacy systems and ensure full integration with all necessary internal and external systems by Q2 end.
   
3. **Performance Optimization:** Conduct a thorough review of platform performance metrics in Q2, identifying areas for optimization to enhance speed and accuracy of risk modeling outputs.

**Resource and Budget Overview**

- **Budget Usage:** We have adhered to the approved budget, with 80% allocated to platform deployment, 15% to training initiatives, and 5% reserved for contingencies. Current spending aligns with projections, and no significant deviations are anticipated.
  
- **Staffing:** The dedicated project team is adequately staffed with necessary skill sets. We are exploring opportunities for cross-training to enhance internal capabilities and reduce reliance on external vendors in the long term.
  
- **Vendor Collaboration:** Ongoing collaboration with technology vendors remains positive, focusing on resolving integration issues and optimizing platform performance. Regular vendor meetings ensure alignment with project objectives.
  
- **Dependencies:** We are actively managing dependencies related to data migration and system integrations, ensuring timely resolution of any arising issues through close coordination with internal IT departments and external vendors.

In conclusion, SecureGuard Insurance Holdings' Risk Modeling Platform Rollout project is demonstrating steady progress in its Post-Go-Live Support phase. By addressing current challenges proactively and setting clear objectives for the next quarter, we aim to maximize the platform's benefits for our risk assessment processes and overall business strategy.
