   - Mitigation: Ongoing negotiations with technology vendors for better pricing and exploring alternative solutions without compromising on quality or functionality.

2. **Vendor Dependency (Low Risk):**
   - Reliance on a key vendor for proprietary IoT devices has introduced a dependency risk, as delays from this vendor could impact project timelines.
   - Mitigation: Engaging with secondary vendors to ensure contingency plans are in place and actively monitoring vendor performance through regular updates and progress reviews.

**Next Quarter Objectives**

1. **Detailed System Design (Q2 Target):**
   - Finalize detailed system design, including software specifications and integration blueprints.
   - Deliverable: Comprehensive System Design Document (CSD) by end of Q2 2023.

2. **Prototype Testing and Feedback Loop (Ongoing):**
   - Conduct user acceptance testing (UAT) with select driver groups to gather feedback on prototypes.
   - Deliverable: Revised UI/UX based on UAT feedback by mid-Q2 2023.

3. **Security Certification Preparation (Q2 Target):**
   - Initiate the process for obtaining necessary security certifications to meet industry standards and regulatory compliance.
   - Deliverable: Security certification application submitted by end of Q2 2023.

**Resource and Budget Overview**

- **Budget Usage:** Current expenditure stands at $850,000, exceeding the initial budget of $770,000 by approximately 10%. Active measures are in place to control further escalation through vendor negotiations and exploring cost-effective alternatives.
  
- **Staffing:** The dedicated project team comprises 15 members, including senior architects, UX designers, security experts, and project managers. Additional support from specialized vendors is being managed effectively to ensure seamless collaboration.

- **Vendor Collaboration:** Strong partnerships with primary and secondary IoT device vendors are maintained through regular communication and joint planning sessions. This ensures flexibility in addressing potential supply chain disruptions or technology limitations.

In conclusion, TransGlobal Logistics Inc. remains committed to delivering a state-of-the-art Fleet Management Platform that will significantly enhance operational efficiency and customer satisfaction. We are proactively managing identified risks and maintaining open communication channels with all stakeholders to ensure project success in the upcoming quarters.
