**Executive Summary**

SecureFuture Insurance Solutions (SFIS) is pleased to report on the progress of the Risk Modeling Platform (RMP) rollout, currently in its Post-Go-Live Support phase. The project remains on track with a positive overall sentiment among stakeholders. Key milestones have been achieved, and the platform has begun delivering anticipated benefits, enhancing our risk assessment capabilities and contributing to improved underwriting decisions.

**Key Milestones Achieved**

1. **Platform Deployment:** The Risk Modeling Platform was successfully deployed across all targeted business units by the end of Q1 2023, achieving 100% completion. This milestone has enabled SFIS to centralize and standardize risk assessment processes, leading to more consistent and data-driven underwriting decisions.

2. **Integration with Core Systems:** Integration with core insurance systems (Policy Administration, Claims Management, etc.) was completed at 95% by Q2 end. This integration is crucial for real-time risk scoring and automated decision support, impacting our ability to respond swiftly to market changes and customer needs.

3. **Training and Knowledge Transfer:** Over 80% of key personnel have been trained on the new platform, ensuring a smooth transition and operational readiness. This has laid a solid foundation for sustained user adoption and continuous improvement.

**Current Risks and Blockers**

1. **Stakeholder Misalignment:** Some stakeholders have expressed concerns regarding the perceived complexity of the new platform, impacting initial user adoption rates. To address this, SFIS is implementing targeted communication strategies and additional training sessions to enhance understanding and confidence among users.

2. **Data Quality Issues:** Inconsistencies in data quality across various business units have been identified as a potential risk to accurate risk modeling. A dedicated Data Governance team has been established to monitor and improve data integrity, ensuring the reliability of model outputs.

**Next Quarter Objectives**

1. **User Adoption Enhancement:** Increase user engagement and satisfaction by 20% through tailored training programs and ongoing support. This will be achieved by Q3 end, with measurable improvements in platform usage metrics.

2. **Model Refinement:** Collaborate with data scientists to refine risk models based on real-world data, aiming for a 15% improvement in predictive accuracy by Q4. This will involve close partnerships with external vendors specializing in actuarial modeling.

3. **Scalability Planning:** Initiate a feasibility study for scaling the RMP to additional product lines and geographies, targeting a preliminary roadmap by Q3 end. This will position SFIS to expand the platform's benefits across the organization.

**Resource and Budget Overview**
