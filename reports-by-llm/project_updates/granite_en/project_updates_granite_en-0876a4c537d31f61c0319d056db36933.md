**Executive Summary**

The Campus WiFi Upgrade project, led by Educational Institution Name (EIN), is progressing as planned. We are currently in the implementation phase, having successfully completed several key milestones. The project remains on track to meet its objectives, with a positive overall sentiment among stakeholders and team members.

**Key Milestones Achieved**

1. **Site Surveys and Design Finalization (80% completion):** Completed site surveys across all campus buildings and finalized the WiFi network design. This milestone has laid a solid foundation for the project, ensuring optimal coverage and performance.

2. **Equipment Procurement (100% completion):** Successfully acquired necessary hardware and software from vendors, with delivery and installation scheduled for Q1 2026.

3. **Initial Site Preparation (75% completion):** Completed initial site preparation work in select buildings, including cable management and mounting of access points. This progress has set the stage for seamless equipment installation.

**Current Risks and Blockers**

1. **Late Deliverables from Vendors:** Some vendors have experienced delays in delivering specific hardware components. To mitigate this risk, EIN's project team is actively engaging with vendors to expedite delivery and exploring alternative suppliers for critical items.

2. **Staffing Shortages:** The implementation phase requires specialized technical expertise, which has led to some staffing shortages. EIN is addressing this by collaborating with external consultants and offering training opportunities to existing team members.

**Next Quarter Objectives**

1. **Equipment Installation (Q1 2026):** Install acquired hardware across all campus buildings, ensuring proper configuration and testing for optimal performance.

   *Deliverable:* Fully operational WiFi network in select buildings by end of Q1 2026.

2. **User Training and Support Material Development (Q1-Q2 2026):** Develop comprehensive training materials and conduct user workshops to ensure a smooth transition for faculty, staff, and students.

   *Deliverable:* Completed training materials and at least two user training sessions by end of Q2 2026.

   *Deliverable:* Full campus WiFi coverage by end of Q3 2026.

**Resource and Budget Overview**

EIN has allocated a total budget of $1,500,000 for the Campus WiFi Upgrade project. As of Q4 2025, approximately $750,000 (50%) has been spent on equipment procurement, site surveys, and initial preparation work. The remaining budget will be utilized for installation, training, and ongoing support.

Staffing-wise, EIN has assigned a dedicated project team of 5 full-time equivalents (FTEs) to manage the implementation phase. In addition, external consultants have been engaged to address specific skill gaps. Vendor collaboration remains positive, with regular progress meetings and open communication channels established.

Dependencies include timely delivery of hardware components and successful user training sessions. EIN is actively monitoring these dependencies and working closely with all stakeholders to ensure minimal disruption to the project timeline.
