**Executive Summary**

Transportation Innovations Inc. is currently engaged in the Autonomous Vehicle Pilot project, a transformative initiative aimed at revolutionizing urban transportation through advanced autonomous vehicle technology. As we progress into Q3 2023, the project finds itself in the Procurement phase, with significant advancements and a few challenges to address. Overall, the project remains on track, demonstrating resilience against industry headwinds.

**Key Milestones Achieved**

1. **Vendor Selection:** Completed the selection of key technology vendors for sensor systems, AI processing units, and communication infrastructure, securing contracts with 80% of required partners by Q3 end.
   
2. **Prototype Development:** Initiated prototype development with a focus on vehicle integration and testing environments. The initial prototype is expected to be ready for internal testing by the end of Q4 2023, marking a 60% completion of this milestone.

3. **Regulatory Framework Engagement:** Successfully engaged with local transport authorities to outline pilot testing parameters and regulatory compliance strategies, ensuring alignment with legal frameworks which is crucial for future scalability.

**Current Risks and Blockers**

1. **Lack of Executive Support:** There has been a noticeable dip in high-level engagement, impacting decision-making speed. To mitigate this, we are scheduling regular updates with C-suite executives to reaffirm the strategic importance and potential ROI of the project.

2. **Technology Integration Challenges:** Integrating diverse vendor technologies has proven more complex than anticipated, leading to minor delays in prototype development. We are addressing this by enhancing communication with vendors and reallocating resources to focus on integration testing.

3. **Public Perception Management:** Negative media portrayals of autonomous vehicle trials have raised public concerns. Our communications team is actively working on a campaign to educate the community about safety measures and benefits, aiming to improve public sentiment before pilot launch.

**Next Quarter Objectives**

1. **Complete Prototype Testing:** Finalize internal testing of the prototype by Q1 2024, ensuring all technical specifications meet project requirements.
   
2. **Secure Final Vendor Agreements:** Conclude negotiations with remaining vendors to finalize contracts and ensure seamless integration into the pilot phase.

3. **Community Engagement and Regulatory Approval:** Launch a comprehensive community engagement plan and seek formal regulatory approval for the pilot program, targeting completion by Q1 2024.

**Resource and Budget Overview**

- **Budget Usage:** We have adhered to the allocated budget, with 75% spent on technology procurement and prototype development. Remaining funds are reserved for testing, community engagement, and regulatory compliance efforts.
  
- **Staffing:** The project team has expanded to include specialized roles in AI integration, vendor management, and public relations, ensuring we have the necessary expertise to navigate current challenges.

- **Vendor Collaboration:** Ongoing collaboration with key vendors is robust, though we are proactively managing expectations regarding timelines due to integration complexities. Dependencies on specific technologies are being closely monitored to avoid project delays.

In conclusion, while the Autonomous Vehicle Pilot project encounters typical growing pains in its procurement phase, Transportation Innovations Inc. remains committed to delivering a groundbreaking solution that aligns with our strategic vision for sustainable and efficient urban mobility. We are confident in our ability to overcome current blockers and achieve our ambitious objectives in the upcoming quarter.
