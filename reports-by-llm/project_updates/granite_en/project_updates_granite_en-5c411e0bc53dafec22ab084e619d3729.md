**Executive Summary**

Utilities Innovations Inc. is pleased to report on the progress of the Outage Management System (OMS) Implementation project as we conclude Q3 2024 and enter the Post-Go-Live Support phase. The project remains on track, with significant advancements made in system integration and user adoption. Our efforts have been focused on ensuring seamless operation post-launch, addressing initial teething issues, and gathering feedback for continuous improvement.

**Key Milestones Achieved**

1. **System Integration**: Full integration of the OMS with existing utility infrastructure was completed by the end of Q2 2024, exceeding the 90% completion target. This milestone has enhanced our ability to manage outages more efficiently and accurately, directly supporting our goal of reducing customer downtime by 30%.

2. **Training and User Adoption**: We have achieved an 85% user adoption rate across key personnel involved in outage management. Training sessions were conducted for over 90% of the targeted staff, ensuring they are well-equipped to utilize the new system effectively. This progress significantly contributes to our objective of improving operational efficiency by 25%.

3. **Initial Performance Metrics**: Post-go-live data indicates a 15% reduction in average outage duration compared to pre-implementation metrics, aligning with our strategic goal of minimizing customer disruption.

**Current Risks and Blockers**

1. **Lack of Executive Support**: There has been intermittent concern from some executive stakeholders regarding the perceived lack of immediate, tangible financial returns post-implementation. To address this, we are currently developing a comprehensive ROI analysis to be presented in the upcoming board meeting, highlighting long-term benefits such as reduced operational costs and improved customer satisfaction scores.

2. **Technical Glitches**: Although rare, occasional system glitches have been reported, primarily during peak load times. Our technical team is actively working on optimizing system performance and addressing these issues through a series of patches and updates scheduled for deployment in Q4 2024.

**Next Quarter Objectives**

1. **Enhanced Reporting Mechanisms**: Implement advanced reporting features within the OMS to provide real-time insights into outage patterns, root causes, and response times by the end of Q1 2025. This will directly support our goal of proactive outage management.

2. **Stakeholder Engagement**: Conduct quarterly stakeholder meetings to gather feedback, address concerns, and ensure alignment with evolving business needs. The first meeting is scheduled for [Insert Date].

3. **Vendor Collaboration**: Strengthen partnerships with key technology vendors to explore potential system enhancements and integrations that align with emerging industry standards and customer expectations.
