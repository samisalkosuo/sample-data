**Quarterly Project Update Report: Public Records Digitization**

**Project Sponsor:** National Archives and Records Administration (NARA)

**Report Period:** Q1 2025

---

**Executive Summary**

The Public Records Digitization project, led by NARA, is currently in the Procurement phase. We are on track with our overall project timeline, demonstrating resilience despite initial challenges. Key progress points include the successful completion of the Needs Assessment and Feasibility Study, which laid a robust foundation for the project's direction. Our team has been proactive in identifying potential risks and developing mitigation strategies, ensuring we maintain momentum towards our objectives.

**Key Milestones Achieved**

1. **Needs Assessment and Feasibility Study Completion (100%):** This foundational work identified critical record types for digitization, estimated volumes, and assessed technological requirements. It directly supports NARA's mission to preserve and provide access to essential records.
   
2. **Vendor Selection Initiated (50%):** We have shortlisted three potential vendors for the digitization equipment and services. The evaluation process is ongoing, with a target completion by Q2 2025.

**Current Risks and Blockers**

1. **Procurement Holdup:** Delays in vendor selection are primarily due to rigorous evaluation criteria to ensure cost-effectiveness and quality. To mitigate this, we've expedited the evaluation timeline without compromising thoroughness. Regular updates with vendors maintain transparency and urgency.

2. **Technology Compatibility Concerns:** Some legacy records require specialized equipment for digitization without damaging them. We're working closely with technical experts to test and validate compatible solutions before finalizing vendor contracts.

**Next Quarter Objectives**

1. **Finalize Vendor Contract (Q2 Target):** Complete the vendor evaluation by mid-quarter, finalize contracts, and initiate equipment delivery. This will set the stage for the Digitization Planning phase in Q3.
   
2. **Digitization Planning Workshops (Q2 Target):** Engage stakeholders from various government departments to outline digitization workflows, ensuring compliance with record retention policies and accessibility standards.

**Resource and Budget Overview**

- **Budget Usage:** We've adhered to the allocated budget for Q1, primarily utilized for project management overhead, feasibility study, and initial vendor engagement activities.

- **Staffing:** Our dedicated project team, comprising archivists, IT specialists, and procurement experts, remains stable and focused. Additional temporary support has been engaged to bolster the procurement process.

- **Vendor Collaboration:** Active communication with shortlisted vendors ensures alignment on project requirements and timelines. Regular meetings are scheduled to address technical queries and contractual details.

- **Dependencies:** The successful completion of vendor selection is critical for progressing into the Digitization Planning phase. We're actively managing this dependency through diligent evaluation processes.

In conclusion, while encountering expected hurdles in the procurement phase, NARA's Public Records Digitization project demonstrates a commitment to thorough planning and risk management. With clear objectives for Q2, we aim to advance towards the execution phase, ensuring the preservation and accessibility of vital public records.
