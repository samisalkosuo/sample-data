**Executive Summary**

NovoPharma Solutions' Clinical Trial Data Platform (CTDP) project is currently in the Post-Go-Live Support phase, following a successful launch in Q1 2024. The platform has demonstrated robust performance and user satisfaction, with minimal disruptions during the initial rollout. We remain on track to meet our strategic objectives, focusing on enhancing data integrity, streamlining clinical trial processes, and fostering collaboration among stakeholders.

**Key Milestones Achieved**

1. **Platform Launch (Q1 2024):** The CTDP was successfully deployed across all intended sites, with 95% of users accessing the platform daily. This achievement has significantly improved data collection accuracy and reduced manual errors by 70%.

2. **Integration with Existing Systems:** We have completed integration with 80% of the planned third-party systems, including EHRs, LIMS, and lab information management tools. This progress has facilitated seamless data exchange and improved overall efficiency in clinical trial operations.

3. **User Training and Support:** Over 90% of end-users have completed mandatory training, and the support team has maintained a 98% satisfaction rate through proactive issue resolution and timely response to user queries.

**Current Risks and Blockers**

1. **Procurement Holdup:** A delay in receiving critical hardware components from a key vendor has impacted the planned expansion of the CTDP to additional trial sites. NovoPharma Solutions is actively engaging with the vendor to expedite delivery and exploring alternative suppliers to mitigate this risk.

2. **Data Migration Challenges:** Some legacy data from existing systems have proven difficult to migrate due to inconsistencies and formatting issues. Our data cleansing team is working diligently to resolve these discrepancies, with an expected resolution by the end of Q3 2024.

**Next Quarter Objectives**

1. **Complete Hardware Procurement and Installation:** Secure necessary hardware components and install them at the remaining trial sites, aiming for full deployment by Q3 2024.

2. **Data Migration and Validation:** Finalize data migration from legacy systems and validate the accuracy of migrated data against source records, targeting completion by Q3 2024.

3. **Enhancements and Customization:** Implement user-requested features and customizations to improve platform usability and functionality, with a target delivery date of Q4 2024.

**Resource and Budget Overview**

1. **Budget Usage:** We have adhered to the approved budget, with 85% allocated to development, 10% for support, and 5% reserved for contingencies. Current expenditures primarily focus on hardware procurement, vendor collaboration, and ongoing platform maintenance.

2. **Staffing:** Our dedicated project team, comprising 15 full-time equivalents (FTEs), remains adequately staffed to manage current tasks and address emerging challenges. We are also investing in upskilling existing resources to ensure long-term project sustainability.
