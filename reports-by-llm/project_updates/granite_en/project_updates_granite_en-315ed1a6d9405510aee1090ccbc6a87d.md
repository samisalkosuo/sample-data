The procurement phase has been successfully initiated, and we have made significant strides in laying the groundwork for a seamless transition to our new digital platform. Key stakeholders are engaged, and communication channels remain open, ensuring that any emerging issues can be swiftly addressed.

**Key Milestones Achieved**
