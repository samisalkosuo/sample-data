**Executive Summary**

Energize Future Solutions (EFS) is currently in the Requirements Gathering phase of our Carbon Capture Pilot Project. The project aims to develop and test a novel carbon capture technology tailored for large-scale industrial applications within the energy sector. We are on track with our initial timeline, having successfully initiated key stakeholder engagements and begun preliminary research into existing carbon capture methodologies. Our progress reflects a proactive approach to understanding industry needs and regulatory frameworks, setting a solid foundation for subsequent project phases.

**Key Milestones Achieved**

1. **Stakeholder Engagement Initiated:** EFS has successfully engaged with over 20 key stakeholders, including major energy producers, environmental NGOs, and government regulatory bodies. This engagement has yielded valuable insights into industry-specific carbon capture challenges and potential solutions. (100% completion)

2. **Literature Review Completed:** A comprehensive review of existing carbon capture technologies was conducted, identifying gaps and opportunities for innovation. This research informs our technology development strategy and positions EFS to offer a competitive edge in the market. (100% completion)

3. **Preliminary Risk Assessment Report:** An initial risk assessment has been drafted, outlining potential technical, regulatory, and financial risks associated with the project. This report guides our mitigation strategies and resource allocation. (95% completion, final review pending)

**Impact on Company Goals:**

The achievements in Q1 directly support EFS's strategic objective of becoming a leader in sustainable energy solutions. By understanding stakeholder needs and technological landscapes, we are well-positioned to develop a carbon capture technology that not only meets industry standards but also anticipates future regulatory demands.

**Current Risks and Blockers**
