**Quarterly Project Update Report: Public Records Digitization**

**Project Sponsor:** National Archives and Records Administration (NARA)

**Report Period:** Q4 2025

---

**Executive Summary**

The Public Records Digitization project, led by the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), is currently in the Deployment phase. The project aims to digitize and make accessible a vast collection of historical government records. We are pleased to report that the project remains on track with significant progress made in Q4 2025.

Key milestones have been achieved, including the successful completion of 75% of the target record sets, with over 1.2 million documents digitized and indexed. This progress significantly contributes to our goal of enhancing public access to government records, thereby promoting transparency and historical research.

**Key Milestones Achieved**

1. **Digitization Completion:** 75% of the target record sets have been digitized, representing over 1.2 million documents. This achievement is a testament to our team's dedication and the effectiveness of our workflow processes.

2. **Indexing Progress:** 60% of the digitized records have been indexed, enabling efficient search and retrieval. This progress is crucial for meeting our objective of providing seamless public access to historical data.

3. **Quality Assurance:** A robust quality assurance process has been established, ensuring that 95% of digitized records meet the required standards for clarity and accuracy.

**Current Risks and Blockers**

Despite our progress, several challenges persist:

1. **Data Quality Issues:** Inconsistencies in data quality, particularly in older record sets, pose a significant risk. To mitigate this, we have increased resources dedicated to data cleaning and pre-processing, with a focus on implementing automated solutions for future record sets.

2. **Vendor Collaboration:** Coordination with external vendors for specialized equipment and software has been challenging due to varying response times. We are addressing this by establishing clear service level agreements (SLAs) and exploring alternative vendor options.

**Next Quarter Objectives**

1. **Digitization Completion:** Aim to complete digitization of the remaining 25% of target record sets, focusing on high-priority collections. This is expected to be achieved by Q1 2026.

2. **Indexing and Metadata Enhancement:** Increase indexing completion rate to 85% and enhance metadata for improved search functionality. This objective is targeted for completion by Q2 2026.

3. **User Testing and Feedback Integration:** Conduct user testing with select stakeholders and integrate feedback into the system design for a more intuitive user experience. This phase is scheduled for Q3 2026.

**Resource and Budget Overview**

- **Budget Usage:** We have adhered to the approved budget, with 85% allocated to digitization equipment and software, 10% to staffing, and 5% reserved for contingencies.

- **Staffing:** The project team comprises 25 full-time equivalents (FTEs), including archivists, IT specialists, and project managers. Additional temporary resources have been engaged to support the ongoing digitization efforts.

- **Vendor Collaboration:** Ongoing negotiations with vendors aim to optimize costs while ensuring timely delivery of required equipment and software upgrades. Dependencies on key vendors are being managed through regular communication and contingency planning.

In conclusion, the Public Records Digitization project continues to make substantial progress toward its objectives. While challenges remain, proactive risk management and a focused approach ensure we maintain momentum towards our goal of transforming public access to historical government records.
