The project is currently on track with respect to the initiation stage, as we have successfully completed key preliminary activities. Our team has established a robust project charter, defined clear objectives, and initiated stakeholder engagement processes. We are also progressing well in identifying potential risks and formulating mitigation strategies.

**Key Milestones Achieved**

1. **Project Charter Completion:** The Core Banking Platform Upgrade Project Charter was finalized and approved by the executive steering committee, outlining project scope, objectives, and high-level success criteria (100%).

FinServe is actively engaging with potential vendors to expedite the contract negotiation process, while exploring alternative solutions to minimize project delays (Ongoing).

2. **Regulatory Compliance Uncertainty:** The evolving regulatory landscape poses a challenge in ensuring that the upgraded platform meets all future compliance requirements. FinServe is closely monitoring regulatory updates and collaborating with legal and compliance teams to incorporate necessary adjustments into the project plan (Ongoing).

**Next Quarter Objectives**
