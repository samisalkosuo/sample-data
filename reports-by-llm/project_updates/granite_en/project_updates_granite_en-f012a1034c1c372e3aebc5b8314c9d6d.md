**Executive Summary:**

The Department of Public Affairs (DPA) is pleased to present the Quarter 4 (Q4) 2024 update for the Civic Engagement Platform project. The platform, designed to enhance citizen participation and transparency in government processes, has successfully transitioned into its Post-Go-Live Support phase. Overall, the project remains on track with key milestones achieved and a positive sentiment among stakeholders.

**Key Milestones Achieved:**

1. **Platform Stabilization (80% completion):** The Civic Engagement Platform has demonstrated robust stability post-launch, with minimal reported issues. User feedback indicates high satisfaction levels, validating the platform's usability and functionality. This achievement directly supports DPA's strategic goal of fostering increased citizen engagement.

2. **Training and Knowledge Transfer (100% completion):** Comprehensive training sessions for government staff have been successfully conducted, ensuring they are well-equipped to manage and maintain the platform independently. This milestone significantly reduces reliance on external support and aligns with DPA's operational efficiency objectives.

3. **Initial Data Analysis (75% completion):** Preliminary data analysis reveals promising trends in citizen participation, indicating that the platform is effectively encouraging active engagement. This insight supports ongoing refinement of platform features and content to maximize impact.

**Current Risks and Blockers:**

1. **Stakeholder Misalignment (Moderate risk):** Some stakeholders have expressed concerns regarding the perceived lack of visibility into platform usage data. To address this, DPA is implementing enhanced reporting mechanisms that will provide transparent, real-time insights into citizen engagement metrics. Regular stakeholder meetings are being scheduled to ensure alignment and manage expectations.

2. **Technical Debt (Low risk):** Minor technical issues have surfaced post-launch, primarily related to integrating third-party APIs. These are being prioritized for resolution in the upcoming quarter to prevent potential disruptions in service.
