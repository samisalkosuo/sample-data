**Quarterly Project Update Report: Public Records Digitization**

**Project Sponsor:** National Archives and Records Administration (NARA)

**Report Period:** Q3 2025

---

**Executive Summary**

The Public Records Digitization project, led by the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), is currently in its Go-Live phase. The project aims to digitize and make accessible a vast collection of historical government records. We are pleased to report that the project remains on track with significant progress made in Q3 2025.

Key milestones have been achieved, including the successful completion of 85% of the digitization process for high-priority records, and the deployment of a robust digital archive platform. User testing has been positive, with over 90% of testers expressing satisfaction with the system's functionality and ease of use.

Despite these successes, we are mindful of ongoing challenges that require proactive management to ensure continued progress.

**Key Milestones Achieved**

1. **Digitization Completion:** 85% of high-priority records have been digitized, with an average resolution of 600 dpi, meeting our quality standards.
2. **Platform Deployment:** The digital archive platform has been successfully deployed and is currently undergoing user acceptance testing (UAT).
3. **Training Programs:** Over 70% of staff involved in the project have completed mandatory training programs, ensuring a solid foundation for the Go-Live phase.

These achievements significantly contribute to NARA's mission of preserving and providing access to essential government records, enhancing transparency and accountability.

**Current Risks and Blockers**

1. **Insufficient Training:** A shortfall in training completion rates (25%) poses a risk to smooth operations during the Go-Live phase. To mitigate this, we are expediting remaining training sessions and introducing online refresher courses for critical staff.
2. **Data Migration Issues:** Some legacy data formats require additional processing time, causing minor delays in the full digitization process. We are working closely with vendors to optimize data extraction methods.
3. **User Adoption Concerns:** While initial UAT feedback is positive, we anticipate potential resistance to change among some user groups. To address this, we will conduct targeted communication campaigns and provide ongoing support post-Go-Live.

**Next Quarter Objectives**

1. **Complete Digitization (Q4 Target):** Aim to finalize digitization of all priority records by Q4 end, ensuring comprehensive coverage of critical historical documents.
2. **User Training and Support:** Increase training completion rate to 100% and establish a dedicated support desk for user queries post-Go-Live.
3. **System Optimization:** Collaborate with vendors to refine data extraction processes, focusing on complex legacy formats, ensuring timely project completion within budget constraints.

**Resource and Budget Overview**

The project has adhered to the approved budget, with expenditures distributed as follows:
- Digitization Equipment: 45%
- Software Licensing & Development: 25%
- Staffing (including training): 20%
- Vendor Services: 10%

Staffing levels remain adequate, with core project team members fully engaged. We are maintaining strong collaboration with vendors, particularly in addressing technical challenges related to data migration. Dependencies on vendor support have been factored into our timeline and risk assessments.

In conclusion, while we face some hurdles, the Public Records Digitization project is progressing well within established parameters. Our proactive management of identified risks ensures we remain on course to deliver a transformative service that aligns with NARA's strategic objectives.
