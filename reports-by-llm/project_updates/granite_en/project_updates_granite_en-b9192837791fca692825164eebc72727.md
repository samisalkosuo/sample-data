**Executive Summary**

Aquatech Industries Inc. is pleased to report on the progress of the Water Treatment Plant Renovation project, currently in the Procurement phase. The project remains on track with a positive outlook for the upcoming quarters. Key milestones have been achieved, and we are actively managing identified risks to ensure timely completion within budget constraints.

**Key Milestones Achieved**

1. **Vendor Selection:** Completed the selection of primary vendors for major equipment and construction services, with contracts signed and executed (90% complete). This milestone is crucial as it lays the groundwork for the subsequent design and engineering phases.
   
2. **Preliminary Design Completion:** Finalized preliminary designs for key components including filtration systems, pump stations, and chemical dosing units (80% complete). These designs have been reviewed internally and are being shared with selected vendors for feedback and potential optimization.

3. **Regulatory Compliance Framework:** Established a comprehensive framework to ensure adherence to local, state, and federal water treatment regulations (100% complete). This foundational work will streamline future approvals and minimize compliance-related delays.

**Current Risks and Blockers**

1. **Vendor Delays:** Some vendors have experienced minor delays in delivering detailed quotations due to unforeseen supply chain disruptions. To mitigate this, we are engaging alternative suppliers and expediting communication with existing partners to secure necessary information promptly.

2. **Design Refinement:** Ongoing discussions with design engineers to refine certain aspects of the preliminary designs, particularly focusing on energy efficiency and potential integration with smart monitoring systems (ongoing). This activity is expected to conclude by Q2 end to align with our engineering procurement schedule.

**Next Quarter Objectives**

1. **Detailed Engineering:** Finalize detailed engineering designs by Q2 end, incorporating vendor feedback and refined specifications. This will enable us to initiate the fabrication and procurement of long-lead items.

2. **Regulatory Approvals:** Submit detailed design packages for regulatory review and secure necessary permits by Q3. This step is critical to avoid project delays due to compliance issues.

3. **Vendor Collaboration:** Strengthen collaboration with key vendors to finalize contracts, specifications, and delivery schedules for major equipment components. Aim to have all critical vendor agreements in place by Q2 end.

**Resource and Budget Overview**

- **Budget Usage:** We are within 95% of the allocated budget for procurement activities, with minor variances attributed to currency fluctuations and unanticipated material price adjustments. Ongoing monitoring ensures that expenditures remain aligned with forecasts.
  
- **Staffing:** The project team composition is adequate, with specialized roles filled by experienced professionals. Additional temporary resources have been engaged to support the increased workload during this procurement phase without overstretching core teams.

- **Vendor Collaboration:** Active engagement with vendors is maintaining good relationships. Regular status meetings and clear communication channels are in place to address any emerging issues swiftly. Dependencies on vendor deliverables are being managed through proactive risk assessments and contingency planning.

In conclusion, Aquatech Industries Inc. remains committed to the successful execution of the Water Treatment Plant Renovation project. We anticipate continued progress as we navigate the procurement phase, with a focus on overcoming current challenges and setting the stage for robust engineering and construction activities in the upcoming quarters.
