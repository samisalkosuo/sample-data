---

**Executive Summary**

SecureFuture Insurance Solutions is currently in the Requirements Gathering phase of the Risk Modeling Platform Rollout project. The project remains on track, with significant progress made in understanding stakeholder needs and industry-specific requirements. Our engagement with key internal and external stakeholders has been productive, yielding valuable insights that will inform the design and development of our advanced risk modeling platform.

**Key Milestones Achieved**

1. **Stakeholder Engagement:** Completed interviews and workshops with 80% of targeted internal departments (Claims, Underwriting, Actuarial, Risk Management) and external partners (Reinsurance brokers, Data providers). This has resulted in a comprehensive understanding of current pain points and future aspirations.

2. **Requirements Documentation:** Drafted an initial 80% of the functional and non-functional requirements document, incorporating feedback from stakeholders. This document serves as the foundation for the upcoming design phase.

3. **Proof of Concept (PoC):** Successfully executed a PoC using existing data sets to demonstrate the feasibility of integrating various risk modeling techniques. The PoC has garnered positive feedback and increased confidence in the project's potential value.

**Current Risks and Blockers**

1. **Lack of Executive Support:** There is a perceived risk of waning executive support due to competing priorities. To mitigate this, we are enhancing communication with senior leadership, highlighting the strategic importance of the project in terms of improved risk assessment, enhanced customer experience, and competitive differentiation.

2. **Data Quality and Availability:** Concerns regarding data quality and availability from various internal and external sources persist. We are addressing this by establishing a Data Governance Committee to oversee data standards, quality checks, and ongoing data cleansing efforts.

**Next Quarter Objectives**

1. **Finalize Requirements Document (Q1):** Complete the requirements document (100%) with input from all stakeholders, ensuring alignment with business objectives and regulatory compliance.

2. **Design and Prototyping (Q1-Q2):** Develop detailed system designs and create interactive prototypes for user acceptance testing (UAT). Aim to finalize the design by Q2 2024.

3. **Vendor Selection (Q1):** Initiate a formal vendor selection process for technology partners, focusing on those with proven experience in insurance risk modeling and data analytics. Aim to select a primary vendor by Q1 2024.

**Resource and Budget Overview**

- **Budget:** We have utilized 60% of the allocated budget for Q4 2023, primarily for stakeholder engagement activities, initial requirements documentation, and PoC execution. Remaining funds will be directed towards vendor selection and design activities in Q1 2024.

- **Staffing:** The project team comprises five full-time equivalents (FTEs) from SecureFuture, supplemented by two external consultants with insurance risk modeling expertise. We are on track to maintain this staffing level through the design and development phases.

- **Dependencies:** The project's progress hinges on timely stakeholder input and data availability. We are actively managing these dependencies through regular communication, clear expectation setting, and proactive data governance initiatives.

In conclusion, SecureFuture Insurance Solutions remains committed to the successful rollout of the Risk Modeling Platform.
