**Key Milestones Achieved**

1. **Feasibility Study Completion (100%):** The comprehensive feasibility study has been finalized, providing robust data on the technical viability, economic analysis, and environmental impact of our proposed carbon capture technology. This forms a critical foundation for the design phase and aligns with EFS's strategic goal of reducing carbon emissions in the energy sector.

2. **Preliminary Design (75%):** The preliminary design of the carbon capture system has been drafted, incorporating feedback from the feasibility study. This includes detailed schematics and initial equipment specifications. Progress is ahead of schedule, setting a positive precedent for subsequent phases.

3. **Stakeholder Engagement (80%):** Regular updates and consultations with regulatory bodies, local communities, and industry partners have been maintained. This engagement ensures transparency and fosters support, crucial for navigating the complex landscape of energy policy and public perception.

**Current Risks and Blockers**

1. **Regulatory Delays:** There is a risk of potential delays due to ongoing revisions in environmental regulations. To mitigate this, EFS has established a dedicated regulatory affairs team working closely with policymakers to stay abreast of changes and influence policy where appropriate.

2. **Technology Integration Challenges:** Integrating the novel carbon capture technology with existing energy infrastructure presents technical complexities. A specialized task force is addressing these issues, leveraging both internal expertise and external vendor collaborations to ensure seamless integration.

**Next Quarter Objectives**

1. **Detailed Design Finalization (Q3 Target):** Complete the detailed engineering design by Q3 2025, incorporating feedback from stakeholders and addressing any emerging technical challenges. This will set the stage for procurement activities in Q4.

2. **Vendor Selection and Contract Negotiation (Q3 Target):** Finalize vendor selection for key equipment components and initiate contract negotiations to secure necessary resources within budget constraints.

3. **Community and Stakeholder Workshops (Q3):** Organize a series of workshops to present the detailed design plans, gather feedback, and reinforce community support. This will be crucial for addressing concerns and ensuring alignment with local and regulatory requirements.
