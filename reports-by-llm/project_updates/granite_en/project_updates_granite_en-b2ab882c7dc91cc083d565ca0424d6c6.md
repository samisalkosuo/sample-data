**Quarterly Project Update Report: Campus WiFi Upgrade**

**Project Sponsor:** EducateTech Solutions Inc.

**Report Period:** Q4 2024

**Executive Summary:**

The Campus WiFi Upgrade project, aimed at enhancing the digital learning experience for students and faculty across EducateTech Solutions' campuses, is currently in the Testing phase. We are pleased to report that the project remains on track with significant progress made in Q4 2024. Key milestones have been achieved, and we anticipate a successful rollout of the upgraded WiFi infrastructure by the end of this fiscal year.

**Key Milestones Achieved:**

1. **Infrastructure Installation (80% completion):** The installation of new access points and backhaul infrastructure across all major campuses is 80% complete. This progress has laid a robust foundation for improved connectivity and coverage.

2. **Network Management System Integration (60% completion):** We have successfully integrated 60% of the Network Management System components, enabling centralized monitoring and control of the WiFi network. This milestone significantly contributes to our goal of streamlining IT operations and reducing maintenance costs.

3. **Security Protocols Implementation (100% completion):** All security protocols, including WPA3 encryption and role-based access controls, have been fully implemented across all campuses. This ensures a secure learning environment for students and faculty.

**Current Risks and Blockers:**

1. **Integration Issues:** During the Testing phase, we've encountered integration challenges with existing legacy systems. To mitigate this risk, our technical team is working closely with vendors to resolve compatibility issues and ensure seamless integration.

2. **Staffing Constraints:** The project has experienced some staffing constraints due to high demand for skilled IT professionals in the education sector. We are actively addressing this by collaborating with local universities to recruit and train future talent, ensuring a steady pipeline of qualified personnel.

**Next Quarter Objectives:**

1. **Complete Network Management System Integration (Q1 2025):** Our objective is to finalize the integration of the remaining Network Management System components by the end of Q1 2025. This will enable centralized network management, real-time monitoring, and proactive issue resolution.

2. **Conduct Campus-wide Testing (Q2 2025):** We plan to perform comprehensive testing across all campuses in Q2 2025, ensuring optimal performance, coverage, and security before the official launch.

3. **User Training and Support (Q3 2025):** Develop and deliver training materials and support resources for students, faculty, and IT staff to ensure a smooth transition to the upgraded WiFi infrastructure.

**Resource and Budget Overview:**

1. **Budget Usage:** As of Q4 2024, we have utilized 75% of the allocated project budget, primarily for infrastructure installation, network equipment, and professional services. We anticipate remaining within the approved budget, with minor adjustments required for additional testing resources in Q1 2025.

2. **Staffing:** Our dedicated project team consists of 10 full-time equivalents (FTEs), including project managers, network engineers, and technical support specialists. We are actively recruiting 3 additional FTEs to address staffing constraints and ensure timely completion of the remaining project phases.

3. **Vendor Collaboration:** We maintain strong relationships with key vendors, such as Cisco and Aruba Networks, ensuring access to necessary equipment, technical support, and training resources. Regular vendor meetings and progress updates help manage dependencies and mitigate risks.

In conclusion, the Campus WiFi Upgrade project continues to make steady progress, with a focus on addressing current challenges and achieving the next set of objectives in Q1-Q3 2025. EducateTech Solutions Inc. remains committed to delivering a state-of-the-art WiFi infrastructure that enhances the learning experience for our campus community.
