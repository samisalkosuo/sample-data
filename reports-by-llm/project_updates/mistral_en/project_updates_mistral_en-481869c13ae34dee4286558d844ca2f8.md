 **GlobalTel Communications Quarterly Project Update Report - Q2 2025**

Dear Senior Stakeholders,

I am pleased to present the GlobalTel Communications Quarterly Project Update for the Billing System Replacement project. This report provides an overview of our progress during Q2 2025, as we continue to move forward in the Procurement phase.

**Executive Summary**

The Billing System Replacement project is on track, with key milestones achieved and a positive overall sentiment. We have successfully completed the Request for Information (RFI) process, engaging with multiple vendors to assess their capabilities and solutions. The RFP (Request for Proposal) phase is currently underway, with a focus on selecting a vendor that best aligns with our company's needs and goals.

**Key Milestones Achieved**

1. Completion of the RFI process: We have received responses from several reputable vendors, providing valuable insights into their offerings and capabilities. This has allowed us to narrow down our potential partners for the project.
2. Vendor evaluation: Our team is currently evaluating the proposals received during the RFI phase, with a focus on technical capabilities, cost, and alignment with our company's strategic objectives.
3. Project timeline refinement: Based on the progress made during Q2, we have revised the project timeline to better align with vendor selection and implementation milestones.

**Current Risks and Blockers**

1. Vendor selection: The RFP process is ongoing, and there is a risk that the selected vendor may not meet all our requirements or expectations. To mitigate this risk, we are conducting thorough evaluations of each proposal and engaging in detailed discussions with potential vendors.
2. Budget constraints: While we have allocated an adequate budget for the project, there is always a risk of unforeseen costs arising during implementation. To manage this risk, we are working closely with our finance team to ensure that all expenses are carefully planned and monitored.

**Next Quarter Objectives**

1. Finalize vendor selection: By the end of Q3 2025, we aim to have selected a vendor and signed a contract for the Billing System Replacement project.
2. Begin system integration: Once the vendor is onboarded, we will initiate the integration process, with a focus on minimizing disruption to our existing services.
3. Establish project governance: We will establish a project steering committee to oversee the implementation and ensure that it aligns with our company's strategic objectives.

**Resource and Budget Overview**

1. Budget usage: To date, we have spent approximately 20% of the allocated budget on the RFI process and vendor evaluation.
2. Staffing: Our project team remains at full capacity, with dedicated resources from various departments collaborating to ensure a successful implementation.
3. Vendor collaboration: We are working closely with potential vendors during the RFP phase, ensuring that we fully understand their offerings and capabilities before making a decision.
4. Dependencies: The success of this project depends on our ability to select a vendor that can deliver a robust, scalable billing system while minimizing disruption to our existing services.

We remain committed to delivering a modern, efficient billing system that will support GlobalTel Communications' growth and competitiveness in the telecommunications industry. We appreciate your continued support and look forward to updating you on our progress in Q3 2025.
