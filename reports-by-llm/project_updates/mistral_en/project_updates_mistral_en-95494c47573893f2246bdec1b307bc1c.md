Executive Summary:

Dear Stakeholders,

We are pleased to present the Q3 2023 project update for our Outage Management System (OMS) Implementation. The project is currently in the testing phase, with significant progress made towards the successful deployment of the system. We are on track with our timeline and have achieved key milestones that align with our company's strategic objectives.

Key Milestones Achieved:
- Completion of the OMS software development, resulting in a 75% overall completion rate.
- Successful integration of the OMS with our existing Grid Management System, enhancing operational efficiency and reducing outage response times by an estimated 20%.
- Conducting comprehensive user acceptance testing (UAT) involving key personnel from various departments to ensure system usability and functionality.

Current Risks and Blockers:
While the project is progressing well, we have identified potential integration issues between the OMS and certain legacy systems. To mitigate this risk, we have engaged our IT team and external consultants to address these challenges and ensure a seamless transition.

Next Quarter Objectives:
- Finalize UAT and resolve any identified issues by Q4 end.
- Conduct system training for all relevant personnel.
- Prepare for the official launch of the OMS, scheduled for January 2024.

Resource and Budget Overview:
Our budget allocation remains on track, with a slight increase in expenditure due to the engagement of external consultants to address integration issues. We are confident that these investments will ensure a successful project outcome. Our dedicated project team continues to collaborate effectively with vendors and internal departments to meet project milestones.

We appreciate your continued support and look forward to updating you on our progress in Q4.
