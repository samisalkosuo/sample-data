 Title: Power Grid Resilience Upgrade Project - Q3 2023 Update Report

**ElectroNexus Utilities Inc.** (ENUI) is pleased to present the Q3 2023 update for our large-scale Power Grid Resilience Upgrade project. The project, initiated in January 2023, has now entered the Go-Live phase, marking a significant milestone in enhancing the reliability and resilience of our power grid infrastructure.

**Executive Summary**

The Power Grid Resilience Upgrade project is progressing as planned, with key deliverables being completed on schedule. The team has successfully implemented several critical upgrades, including advanced monitoring systems and smart grid technologies, which have positively impacted the company's overall operational efficiency and sustainability goals. However, it is essential to note that we are currently operating at 85% completion, with the remaining tasks focused on system integration and testing.

**Key Milestones Achieved**

1. Installation of Advanced Monitoring Systems (AMS): Completed in Q2 2023, the AMS has significantly improved our ability to monitor grid performance and respond promptly to anomalies.

2. Smart Grid Technology Implementation: Currently at 90% completion, this milestone will enable real-time load balancing and optimize energy distribution across the grid.

**Current Risks and Blockers**

1. Procurement Holdup: Delays in receiving critical components from suppliers have impacted our timeline for completing the smart grid technology implementation. To mitigate this, ENUI has engaged alternative vendors and adjusted project timelines accordingly.

2. Staff Training: The complexity of the new technologies requires extensive training for our operational staff. While progress is being made, ensuring all personnel are adequately trained remains a priority to ensure seamless system operation post-Go-Live.

**Next Quarter Objectives**

1. Complete Smart Grid Technology Implementation (Q4 2023): Finalize the installation and integration of smart grid technologies, followed by rigorous testing and validation.

2. Staff Training Completion: Ensure all operational staff are fully trained on the new systems and processes by Q4 2023.

**Resource and Budget Overview**

1. Budget Usage: To date, we have utilized 65% of our allocated budget for this project. The remaining budget will be primarily used for staff training, system testing, and any unforeseen expenses due to the procurement holdup.

2. Staffing: Our dedicated project team remains consistent, with additional resources being allocated for staff training and system testing in Q4 2023.

3. Vendor Collaboration: ENUI continues to collaborate closely with key vendors to address the procurement delays and ensure timely delivery of critical components.

4. Dependencies: The successful completion of the Power Grid Resilience Upgrade project depends on the timely resolution of the current risks, effective staff training, and seamless system integration and testing.

We remain committed to delivering a resilient and efficient power grid infrastructure that will benefit our customers and contribute to ENUI's long-term growth and success. We appreciate your continued support and look forward to updating you on our progress in Q4 2023.
