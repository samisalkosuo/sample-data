While the project is progressing well, we have identified scope creep as a potential risk. To mitigate this, we have established clear communication channels with all stakeholders to ensure alignment on project objectives and expectations. We are also implementing change control procedures to manage any scope changes effectively.

**Next Quarter Objectives**

- Complete the installation and commissioning of the remaining 25% of laboratory equipment
- Conduct a comprehensive review of quality control measures and make necessary adjustments
