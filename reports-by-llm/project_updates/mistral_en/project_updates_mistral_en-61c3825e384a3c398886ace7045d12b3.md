 **Edvance Learning Solutions Quarterly Project Update Report - Q3 2025**

Dear Stakeholders,

I am pleased to present the Edvance Learning Solutions' Q3 2025 project update for the Large-Scale Learning Analytics Platform Deployment in the Education industry. The project is currently in the Post-Go-Live Support phase, and we are making steady progress towards our objectives.

**Executive Summary**

The Learning Analytics Platform deployment is on track, with key milestones achieved and a positive general sentiment. We have successfully launched the platform to a limited user group, and initial feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. The platform is expected to significantly enhance our ability to analyze student performance data, thereby improving educational outcomes.

**Key Milestones Achieved**

1. Limited User Launch: We have successfully deployed the Learning Analytics Platform to a select group of educators and students. This phase has allowed us to gather valuable feedback and identify areas for improvement. The platform is currently at 85% completion, with the remaining features scheduled for implementation in Q4.

2. Data Integration: We have integrated the platform with our existing student information system, ensuring seamless data flow between the two systems. This integration has enabled us to collect and analyze comprehensive student performance data.

**Current Risks and Blockers**

1. Insufficient Training: While we have provided initial training to our users, there is a need for ongoing support to ensure full utilization of the platform's features. To address this, we are implementing a comprehensive training program for all users in Q4.

2. User Adoption: While feedback has been positive, ensuring widespread adoption of the platform remains a challenge. We are addressing this by providing continuous support and engaging with early adopters to share their success stories.

**Next Quarter Objectives**

1. Complete Platform Features: We aim to complete the remaining features of the Learning Analytics Platform in Q4, ensuring full functionality for all users.

2. Expand User Base: We will focus on expanding the user base beyond the initial pilot group, with a goal of reaching 50% adoption by the end of Q4.

3. Analyze Data Insights: With the platform fully operational, we will begin analyzing the data collected to identify trends and areas for improvement in our educational programs.

**Resource and Budget Overview**

1. Budget Usage: To date, we have utilized 70% of our allocated budget for this project. This includes costs for platform development, user training, and ongoing support.

2. Staffing: We have a dedicated team of 15 professionals working on this project, including developers, data analysts, and project managers.

3. Vendor Collaboration: We are collaborating with several vendors for various aspects of the project, including platform development, data integration, and user training.

4. Dependencies: Our primary dependency is ensuring a smooth transition from the pilot phase to full-scale adoption, which will require continued engagement with our users and ongoing support.

We remain committed to delivering a successful Learning Analytics Platform that will revolutionize the way we approach education at Edvance Learning Solutions. We appreciate your continued support and look forward to updating you on our progress in Q4.
