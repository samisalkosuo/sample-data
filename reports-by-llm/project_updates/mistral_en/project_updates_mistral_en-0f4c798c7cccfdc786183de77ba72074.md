 **ElectroNexus Utilities Inc.: Outage Management System Implementation Quarterly Project Update Report - Q4 2025**

Dear Stakeholders,

I am pleased to present the fourth quarter project update for our large-scale initiative, the Outage Management System (OMS) Implementation. ElectroNexus Utilities Inc., as a leading player in the utilities sector, is committed to delivering innovative solutions that enhance our service reliability and customer satisfaction.

**Executive Summary**

The OMS project is currently progressing through the Design Phase, with key deliverables being developed and refined. We are on track with our timeline, having made significant strides in system architecture design, user interface prototyping, and integration planning. The overall sentiment remains positive, as we approach the transition to the Development Phase in Q1 2026.

**Key Milestones Achieved**

During Q4 2025, we successfully completed several critical milestones:

1. Completed the system architecture design, which provides a robust foundation for the OMS implementation. This milestone ensures that our system will be scalable, secure, and capable of handling the complexities of managing power outages across our extensive service area.
2. Developed and presented user interface prototypes to key stakeholders, receiving positive feedback and valuable insights for further refinement. These prototypes will serve as a blueprint for the final system design, ensuring an intuitive and efficient user experience.
3. Established integration plans with our existing systems, ensuring seamless data flow between the OMS and other critical utilities infrastructure. This milestone is crucial for maintaining operational efficiency during and after the OMS implementation.

These achievements have a direct impact on our company goals by improving service reliability, reducing outage response times, and enhancing customer satisfaction.

**Current Risks and Blockers**

While we are making steady progress, there are challenges that require attention:

1. Staff turnover has been higher than anticipated, resulting in delays in certain deliverables. To mitigate this risk, we have implemented a retention strategy that includes competitive compensation packages, professional development opportunities, and team-building activities.
2. The complexity of integrating the OMS with our existing systems necessitates close collaboration with vendors. We are working diligently to ensure clear communication channels and timely responses from our vendor partners to minimize potential delays.

**Next Quarter Objectives**

In Q1 2026, we will transition into the Development Phase, focusing on:

1. Developing the OMS core functionalities based on the design deliverables completed in Q4 2025.
2. Conducting thorough testing and quality assurance to ensure the system meets our high standards for reliability and performance.
3. Establishing a comprehensive training program for our staff to facilitate a smooth transition to the new OMS.

**Resource and Budget Overview**

Our budget allocation remains on track, with expenditures primarily focused on project personnel, vendor collaboration, and technology infrastructure. We are actively monitoring resource utilization to ensure optimal efficiency and cost-effectiveness throughout the project lifecycle.

In conclusion, we are making steady progress in our OMS Implementation project, with key milestones achieved and a clear path forward into the Development Phase. We remain committed to delivering this critical system on time and within budget, enhancing our service reliability and customer satisfaction.

Thank you for your continued support and engagement in this important initiative.

Sincerely,
