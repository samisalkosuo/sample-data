Executive Summary:

The Customer Loyalty Platform Upgrade project is progressing as planned during Q2 2023, with key milestones achieved and the deployment phase now underway. The platform's modernization aims to enhance customer experience, boost sales, and streamline operations for RetailMax Corporation. The current status can be characterized as on track, with a focus on addressing minor challenges that have arisen during the deployment process.

Key Milestones Achieved:

1. Completion of platform integration testing (95%): Successful integration of the new loyalty platform with existing systems has been achieved, with only minor adjustments required to ensure seamless functionality across all touchpoints.
2. User Acceptance Testing (UAT) commencement: UAT was initiated in Q2 2023, allowing key stakeholders and end-users to evaluate the platform's performance and provide valuable feedback for further refinements.
3. Vendor collaboration: Collaboration with our technology partner, TechSolutions Inc., has been fruitful, ensuring timely delivery of required resources and expertise throughout the project lifecycle.

Current Risks and Blockers:
