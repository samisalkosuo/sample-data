 Title: Customer Portal Migration Project Update - Q2 2023

Company Name: Atlas Risk Management Group (ARMG)

Executive Summary:
The Customer Portal Migration project at ARMG is progressing as planned during the second quarter of 2023, with key milestones achieved and a positive overall sentiment. The project team has successfully completed the initial phase of requirements gathering and analysis, setting the foundation for a seamless transition to our new customer portal platform.

Key Milestones Achieved:
1. Completed Requirements Gathering and Analysis (100% completion) - This deliverable provided valuable insights into user needs, system functionality, and integration requirements, ensuring a well-informed decision-making process for the selection of our new portal platform.
2. Vendor Selection (95% completion) - Following an extensive evaluation process, we have narrowed down potential vendors to three leading contenders in the insurance industry. The final vendor selection is expected by the end of Q3 2023.
3. Project Plan Development (80% completion) - A comprehensive project plan has been drafted, outlining timelines, deliverables, and resource allocation for each phase of the migration process.

Current Risks and Blockers:
1. Scope Creep - As with any large-scale project, there is a risk of scope creep due to evolving business needs and stakeholder expectations. To mitigate this risk, we have established clear communication channels between the project team, stakeholders, and end-users to ensure alignment on project objectives and deliverables.
2. Integration Challenges - Given the complexity of integrating our new portal with existing systems, there is a potential for technical difficulties during the implementation phase. To address this challenge, we have allocated additional resources to focus on testing and troubleshooting throughout the migration process.

Next Quarter Objectives:
1. Finalize Vendor Selection (Q3 2023) - The project team will complete vendor evaluations and make a final decision on our new portal platform by the end of Q3 2023.
2. Sign Contract with Selected Vendor (Q4 2023) - Once the vendor is selected, we will negotiate and sign a contract outlining project scope, timelines, deliverables, and pricing.
3. Begin Portal Platform Implementation (Q4 2023) - Following the signing of the contract, our chosen vendor will commence the implementation phase, with a focus on system integration, data migration, and user testing.

Resource and Budget Overview:
1. Budget Usage - To date, we have allocated $500,000 for the project, with approximately 20% spent on vendor evaluations, requirements gathering, and initial planning efforts.
2. Staffing - The project team consists of dedicated resources from various departments within ARMG, including IT, Product Management, and Customer Service. In addition, we have engaged external consultants to support specific areas of expertise during the migration process.
3. Vendor Collaboration - We are currently collaborating with three leading vendors in the insurance industry, with a focus on understanding their capabilities, pricing, and potential impact on our project timeline and budget.
4. Dependencies - The success of this project is dependent on the selection of a suitable vendor, effective communication between stakeholders, and successful integration with existing systems. We will continue to monitor these dependencies closely throughout the migration process.
