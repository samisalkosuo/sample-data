 **Campus WiFi Upgrade Project Quarterly Update Report**

**Q2 2023**

**Project Title:** Campus WiFi Upgrade

**Organization:** Edvance Learning Solutions

**Executive Summary**

The Campus WiFi Upgrade project, initiated by Edvance Learning Solutions, is progressing steadily in Q2 2023. We are currently in the Monitoring & Evaluation phase, ensuring the successful implementation of our new high-capacity wireless network infrastructure across all campuses. Key milestones have been achieved, with a focus on improving network reliability and enhancing learning experiences for students and faculty. The project is on track, demonstrating our commitment to delivering a modern, efficient, and robust digital learning environment.

**Key Milestones Achieved**

1. **Campus Network Assessment (100% completion):** Comprehensive assessments of existing network infrastructure were conducted at all campuses, providing valuable insights for the design and implementation of our new WiFi system.
2. **Vendor Selection (95% completion):** Following a rigorous evaluation process, we have selected three leading vendors to provide hardware and software solutions for our project. The final vendor selection is expected by the end of Q2.
3. **Network Design & Planning (70% completion):** Detailed network designs have been developed for each campus, taking into account capacity requirements, coverage, and future scalability needs.
4. **Pilot Deployment (50% completion):** A pilot deployment was initiated at one of our smaller campuses to test the new WiFi system's performance, stability, and user experience. Preliminary results are positive, with improved network speeds and reduced downtime.

**Current Risks and Blockers**

1. **Procurement Holdup:** Delays in finalizing vendor contracts due to ongoing negotiations have resulted in a slight delay in the procurement of necessary equipment for the remaining campuses. To mitigate this risk, we are working closely with our legal team to expedite contract negotiations and ensure timely delivery of equipment.
2. **Staff Training:** With the introduction of new hardware and software solutions, it is crucial that our IT staff receive comprehensive training to effectively manage and maintain the upgraded network. To address this challenge, we have partnered with a leading technology training provider to deliver tailored training programs for our IT team.

**Next Quarter Objectives**

1. **Finalize Vendor Contracts (Q2 2023):** Secure contracts with selected vendors and initiate procurement of equipment for all campuses.
2. **Complete Network Deployment (Q3 2023):** Roll out the new WiFi system across all campuses, ensuring seamless integration with existing infrastructure and minimal disruption to daily operations.
3. **User Acceptance Testing (Q3 2023):** Conduct user acceptance testing at each campus to validate the performance of the new network and gather feedback for potential improvements.
4. **Staff Training & Support (Ongoing):** Continue providing training and support to our IT staff to ensure they are equipped to manage and maintain the upgraded network effectively.

**Resource and Budget Overview**

1. **Budget Usage:** To date, 40% of the project budget has been allocated, primarily for vendor selection, network design, and pilot deployment.
2. **Staffing:** Our dedicated project team remains in place, with additional resources being mobilized for user acceptance testing and staff training.
3. **Vendor Collaboration:** Close collaboration with our selected vendors is essential to ensure timely delivery of equipment and successful implementation of the new WiFi system.
4. **Dependencies:** The success of this project depends on the timely resolution of current risks, effective communication between teams, and the support of senior stakeholders in making critical decisions.
