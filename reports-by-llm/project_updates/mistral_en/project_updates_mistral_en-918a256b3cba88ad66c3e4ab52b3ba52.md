 **Healthcare Horizons Inc. Hospital Expansion Project Quarterly Update Report - Q1 2023**

Dear Senior Stakeholders,

I am pleased to present the first quarterly update for the Hospital Expansion Project at Healthcare Horizons Inc. This report provides an overview of our progress, key milestones achieved, current risks and blockers, next quarter objectives, resource and budget status, and general sentiment regarding the project's current state.

**Executive Summary**

The Hospital Expansion Project is currently in the Monitoring & Evaluation phase, with overall progress being on track. We have successfully completed several key deliverables, including site preparation, foundation laying, and structural framing. The project team has demonstrated a strong commitment to quality and safety throughout these stages.

**Key Milestones Achieved**

1. Site Preparation (100% completion): Completion of site clearance, leveling, and soil testing.
2. Foundation Laying (85% completion): Concrete pouring for the hospital's foundation is underway, with only minor adjustments required due to unforeseen ground conditions.
3. Structural Framing (60% completion): Steel framing for the hospital building has been erected up to the third floor.

These milestones have significantly contributed to our company's goal of expanding our healthcare facilities to better serve our community.

**Current Risks and Blockers**

1. Regulatory Delays: Ongoing delays in obtaining necessary permits from local authorities have caused minor schedule disruptions. To mitigate this, we are actively engaging with regulatory bodies to expedite the approval process.
2. Material Shortages: There has been a temporary shortage of certain construction materials due to increased demand and supply chain disruptions. We are working closely with our vendors to secure necessary materials as soon as possible.

**Next Quarter Objectives**

1. Complete foundation work and commence with floor slab installation (April).
2. Continue steel framing and erect the remaining floors up to the rooftop (May).
3. Initiate MEP (Mechanical, Electrical, Plumbing) works, including installing HVAC systems, electrical wiring, and plumbing fixtures (June).

**Resource and Budget Overview**

1. Budget Usage: To date, we have utilized 35% of the allocated budget for this project. This includes costs related to site preparation, foundation laying, and structural framing.
2. Staffing: We have maintained a consistent team of 80 construction workers on-site, with additional specialists brought in as needed for specific tasks.
3. Vendor Collaboration: We are collaborating closely with our preferred vendors for materials supply and specialized services such as electrical and plumbing works.
4. Dependencies: Our next quarter objectives depend on the timely delivery of construction materials and regulatory approvals.

In conclusion, while we have faced some challenges in Q1 2023, the Hospital Expansion Project remains on track. We are committed to overcoming current obstacles and delivering a state-of-the-art healthcare facility that will significantly enhance our services to the community.
