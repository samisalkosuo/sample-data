 Title: Civic Engagement Platform Quarterly Project Update Report - Q3 2023

**Company Name:** Government Digital Solutions (GDS)

**Project:** Civic Engagement Platform (CEP)

### Executive Summary

The CEP project is progressing as planned, with key milestones achieved and a positive overall sentiment of being on track. During Q3 2023, we have successfully completed the Request for Proposals (RFP) process, attracting a robust response from potential vendors. The shortlisting process is currently underway, with a view to finalizing vendor selection by the end of this quarter.

### Key Milestones Achieved

1. **Completion of RFP Process:** We received responses from 25 potential vendors, demonstrating strong industry interest in our project. The responses are currently being evaluated based on criteria such as technical capability, cost, and proposed timeline.

2. **Shortlisting Vendors:** The evaluation process is ongoing, with a goal to shortlist three vendors for further discussions by the end of Q3 2023. This will enable us to negotiate contracts and establish partnerships that best align with our project objectives.

The successful completion of these milestones has significantly boosted our confidence in delivering a robust Civic Engagement Platform, contributing positively to our company's mission of enhancing citizen engagement and service delivery.

### Current Risks and Blockers

1. **Vendor Delays:** Due to the high demand for our project, some vendors may experience delays in submitting their proposals. To mitigate this risk, we have extended the RFP deadline and are actively communicating with potential vendors to ensure timely submission of proposals.

2. **Complexity of Project Scope:** The CEP project encompasses a wide range of functionalities, which could potentially lead to challenges in vendor selection and integration. To address this, we have broken down the project into manageable modules, ensuring each vendor is evaluated based on their expertise in specific areas.

### Next Quarter Objectives

1. **Finalize Vendor Selection:** By the end of Q4 2023, we aim to finalize our partnership with a preferred vendor and commence contract negotiations.

2. **Initiate Design Phase:** Upon vendor selection, we will initiate the design phase, focusing on creating wireframes and user interfaces for the CEP.

3. **Establish Project Timeline:** In collaboration with the selected vendor, we will establish a detailed project timeline, outlining key deliverables and milestones.

### Resource and Budget Overview

1. **Budget Usage:** To date, our budget has been primarily allocated towards the RFP process, including advertising, evaluation, and communication costs. As we move into the design phase, additional funds will be allocated for design and development activities.

2. **Staffing:** Our dedicated project team remains in place, with resources being allocated based on the current stage of the project. As we progress into the design and development phases, we may require additional staff to ensure timely delivery of the CEP.

3. **Vendor Collaboration:** We are currently collaborating with potential vendors during the evaluation process. Upon finalizing our partnership, we will establish a strong working relationship with the selected vendor to ensure successful project execution.

4. **Dependencies:** Our primary dependency remains the successful selection of a suitable vendor who can deliver on the project's technical requirements and timeline. We are actively managing this risk through rigorous evaluation processes and open communication with potential vendors.
