 Title: Smart Meter Installation Project Update - Q4 2024

ElectroNexus Utilities Corporation (ENUC)

Executive Summary:

The Smart Meter Installation project, a cornerstone initiative of ENUC's strategic vision for modernizing our infrastructure, is progressing steadily in the Procurement phase. Key milestones have been achieved, with 75% of the required vendors secured and contracts under negotiation. The project remains on track, demonstrating our commitment to delivering a more efficient, reliable, and sustainable energy network for our customers.

Key Milestones Achieved:

1. Vendor Selection: We have successfully shortlisted 25 potential vendors from an initial pool of over 100, representing a significant reduction in the candidate pool. This has been achieved through rigorous evaluation processes, ensuring we select partners that align with our quality and sustainability standards.

2. Contract Negotiation: Discussions are ongoing with the selected vendors to finalize contracts, focusing on pricing, delivery schedules, and performance guarantees. To date, 18 contracts have been agreed upon, accounting for 75% of the total required vendor agreements.

Current Risks and Blockers:

1. Delayed Vendor Responses: A small number of vendors have yet to respond to our contract proposals, potentially impacting our timeline for completing procurement activities. To mitigate this risk, we are engaging in follow-up communications with these vendors and exploring alternative options if necessary.

2. Regulatory Compliance: Ensuring compliance with various local and national regulations is essential to the success of this project. ENUC's legal team is working diligently to address any potential regulatory challenges that may arise during the procurement process.

Next Quarter Objectives:

1. Finalize Vendor Contracts: Our primary focus for Q1 2025 will be to finalize contracts with the remaining vendors, aiming to secure 100% of our required partnerships by the end of the quarter.

2. Initiate Pre-Installation Planning: Once all vendor agreements are in place, we will begin pre-installation planning, including site assessments and logistics coordination, with a target start date for installation activities in Q2 2025.

Resource and Budget Overview:

1. Budget Usage: To date, 30% of the allocated budget has been expended, primarily on vendor selection and contract negotiation activities. As we move into the next phase of the project, we anticipate increased spending on pre-installation planning and logistics coordination.

2. Staffing: The project team remains at full capacity, with dedicated personnel assigned to vendor management, legal compliance, and project management functions. We will continue to collaborate closely with our vendors and internal departments to ensure a smooth transition into the installation phase.

3. Vendor Collaboration: Strong relationships with our selected vendors are essential for the success of this project. Regular communication channels have been established, and we are working closely with our partners to address any issues that may arise during contract negotiations and pre-installation planning.

In conclusion, the Smart Meter Installation project is progressing well, with key milestones achieved and a clear path forward for Q1 2025. We remain committed to delivering this project on time and within budget, ensuring ENUC's continued leadership in the utilities sector.
