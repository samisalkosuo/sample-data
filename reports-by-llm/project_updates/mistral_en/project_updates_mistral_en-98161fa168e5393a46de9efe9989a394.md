**Current Risks and Blockers**

1. Insufficient Training: To ensure a smooth transition, it is crucial that all customer service representatives are adequately trained on the new portal. While training sessions have been scheduled, there is a risk of delays due to conflicting schedules and potential technical issues. To mitigate this risk, we have allocated additional resources for training coordination and troubleshooting.
2. Vendor Collaboration: Coordinating with multiple vendors during the integration phase can be challenging. We are addressing this by establishing clear communication channels, setting expectations, and regularly reviewing progress to ensure timely resolution of any issues that may arise.

2. User Acceptance Testing (target start date: January 2024): Once system integration is complete, user acceptance testing will commence to validate the functionality and usability of the upgraded portal.
3. Prepare for Rollout (target completion: Q1 2024): Concurrently with user acceptance testing, we will also be preparing for the rollout of the new portal, including finalizing training materials, updating documentation, and coordinating with relevant teams to ensure a smooth transition.
