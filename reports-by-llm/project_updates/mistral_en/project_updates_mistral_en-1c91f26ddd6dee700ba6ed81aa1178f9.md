 **Quarterly Project Update Report: Billing System Replacement**

**Company Name:** OptiCom Networks Inc.

**Project Title:** Billing System Replacement

**Date:** June 30, 2024

**Executive Summary**

The Billing System Replacement project is progressing as planned during Q2 2024, with the system now in the Post-Go-Live Support phase. Key milestones have been achieved, including the successful migration of over 95% of customer accounts to the new billing platform. The project remains on track, demonstrating a positive impact on our company's goal of enhancing operational efficiency and reducing costs associated with legacy systems.

**Key Milestones Achieved**

1. Migration of 95% of customer accounts to the new billing system: This significant milestone has improved the overall stability and reliability of our billing processes, reducing errors and improving customer satisfaction.
2. Implementation of automated reconciliation tools: These tools have streamlined the reconciliation process between the old and new billing systems, ensuring accurate data transfer and minimizing potential discrepancies.
3. Successful resolution of major post-go-live issues: The team has effectively addressed and resolved critical issues that arose following the system launch, demonstrating our commitment to delivering a high-quality solution.

**Current Risks and Blockers**

1. Budget Overruns: Due to unforeseen complications during the migration process, we have experienced minor budget overruns totaling approximately 5% of the initial budget allocation. To mitigate this issue, we are implementing cost-saving measures in subsequent quarters, such as reducing non-essential project expenses and optimizing staffing levels.
2. Staff Training: While the majority of our team has successfully adapted to the new billing system, ongoing training is required for a small number of employees who have struggled with the transition. To address this challenge, we are providing additional resources and support to ensure all team members are proficient in using the new platform.

**Next Quarter Objectives**

1. Complete migration of remaining customer accounts: Our primary objective for Q3 2024 is to complete the migration of the remaining 5% of customer accounts, ensuring a seamless transition to the new billing system.
2. Optimize system performance and scalability: We will focus on fine-tuning the system's performance and scalability to accommodate future growth and ensure optimal service delivery.
3. Conduct user acceptance testing (UAT): In collaboration with key stakeholders, we will conduct UAT to validate the functionality of the new billing system and gather feedback for potential improvements.

**Resource and Budget Overview**

1. Budget Usage: Despite the minor budget overruns experienced during Q2 2024, we are confident that our cost-saving measures will bring us back on track in subsequent quarters.
2. Staffing: Our team remains dedicated to delivering a successful project, with key resources allocated to critical tasks such as migration, testing, and system optimization.
3. Vendor Collaboration: We continue to collaborate closely with our technology partners to ensure the smooth implementation of the new billing system and address any technical challenges that may arise.
4. Dependencies: Our primary dependencies for Q3 2024 include the successful completion of customer account migrations, ongoing staff training, and the resolution of any remaining post-go-live issues.

In conclusion, the Billing System Replacement project is progressing well, with key milestones achieved and a positive impact on our company's goals. We remain committed to addressing current challenges and delivering a high-quality solution that enhances operational efficiency and reduces costs associated with legacy systems.
