To mitigate this, we have established clear communication channels with all stakeholders and implemented a change management process to ensure any additional features or functionalities are properly assessed and prioritized.
2. The remaining 10% of the project, primarily focusing on advanced analytics and predictive maintenance, is currently delayed due to complexities in data collection and analysis. We are working closely with our data science team and third-party vendors to expedite this process while maintaining the quality of deliverables.

Next Quarter Objectives:
1. Complete the remaining 10% of the project, including advanced analytics and predictive maintenance modules.
2. Conduct a comprehensive user acceptance testing (UAT) phase involving all relevant stakeholders.
3. Finalize staff training on the new FMS features and functionalities.
4. Prepare for a phased rollout of the platform across our entire fleet, starting with key operational departments.
