Key deliverables have been completed, and we are on track with our timeline, demonstrating a strong commitment to our company's strategic goals.

Key Milestones Achieved:
1. Integration of the new scheduling algorithm with existing rail management systems: 95% completion. This milestone significantly improves efficiency in managing train schedules and reduces delays, contributing positively to our overall operational performance.
2. Successful pilot testing of the optimized scheduling system across three major rail lines: Completed. The results show a 10% reduction in delays and an increase in on-time arrivals by 8%.
3. Collaboration with key vendors for hardware and software solutions: Ongoing, with all contracts signed and deliveries scheduled for Q1 2026.

Current Risks and Blockers:
1. Staff turnover has been a challenge, particularly in the IT department. To mitigate this risk, we have implemented a retention strategy that includes competitive compensation packages, professional development opportunities, and team-building activities.

Next Quarter Objectives:
1. Complete system integration (remaining 5%) and conduct comprehensive testing across all rail lines.
2. Train staff on the new scheduling system and roll out the optimized schedules.
3. Monitor system performance and gather feedback for potential improvements.
4. Finalize vendor collaborations and ensure timely delivery of hardware and software solutions.

Resource and Budget Overview:
