**ElectroNexus Utilities Corporation**

Dear Stakeholders,

We are pleased to present the Q3 2024 update for our large-scale Power Grid Resilience Upgrade project. ElectroNexus Utilities Corporation remains committed to enhancing the reliability and resilience of our power grid infrastructure, a critical step towards ensuring uninterrupted service for our customers.

**Executive Summary**

The Power Grid Resilience Upgrade project is currently in the System Integration phase, with key milestones achieved on schedule. The project team has made significant progress in integrating various system components, demonstrating a positive trajectory towards completion.

**Key Milestones Achieved**

1. Completion of Smart Grid Infrastructure: We have successfully installed and integrated the smart grid infrastructure across our service areas, enabling real-time monitoring and control of power distribution. This development will significantly improve our ability to respond to outages and optimize energy usage.

2. Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) Deployment: The deployment of AMI is now 85% complete, with over 1 million smart meters installed. This milestone will enable us to provide customers with real-time energy consumption data, fostering energy efficiency and demand management.

**Current Risks and Blockers**

1. Insufficient Training: While we have made progress in training our staff on the new systems, there remains a need for further education to ensure full proficiency. To address this challenge, we are implementing additional training programs and resources to ensure all team members are adequately prepared to manage the upgraded infrastructure.

**Next Quarter Objectives**

1. Complete Advanced Metering Infrastructure Deployment: Our primary objective for Q4 2024 is to complete the deployment of AMI, ensuring full coverage across our service areas.

2. Finalize System Integration and Testing: We will focus on finalizing system integration and conducting rigorous testing to ensure the smooth operation of the upgraded power grid.

**Resource and Budget Overview**

1. Budget Usage: To date, we have utilized 65% of our allocated budget for this project. The remaining budget will be used primarily for system integration, testing, and training activities.

2. Staffing: We have maintained a dedicated team of engineers, technicians, and support staff to manage the Power Grid Resilience Upgrade project. In Q4 2024, we anticipate an increase in staffing levels as we enter the final stages of system integration and testing.

3. Vendor Collaboration: We continue to collaborate closely with our key vendors to ensure timely delivery of equipment and services. Our strong relationships with these partners have been instrumental in the successful execution of this project thus far.

We appreciate your continued support as we work towards completing the Power Grid Resilience Upgrade project. We remain committed to delivering a more resilient, efficient, and reliable power grid for our customers.
