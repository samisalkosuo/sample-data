 Title: Customer Portal Migration Project Update - Q4 2024

Dear Stakeholders,

I am pleased to present the quarterly update for our large-scale Customer Portal Migration project, spearheaded by AssuranceOne Insurance Group. This report provides an overview of our progress, key milestones, current risks, next quarter objectives, resource and budget status, and vendor collaborations.

**Executive Summary**

The Customer Portal Migration project is currently in the testing phase, with a general sentiment of being on track. We have made significant strides in migrating our customer portal to a more modern and user-friendly platform, which aligns with our strategic goals of enhancing customer experience and digital transformation.

**Key Milestones Achieved**

1. Completion of the development phase: 95% completion, with only minor bug fixes remaining. This milestone has significantly improved the functionality and efficiency of the new portal.
2. Successful user acceptance testing (UAT) with a pilot group of customers, resulting in valuable feedback for further improvements.
3. Establishment of partnerships with key vendors for seamless integration of third-party services into the new portal.

**Current Risks and Blockers**

1. Insufficient training: To mitigate this risk, we have allocated additional resources to provide comprehensive training sessions for both internal staff and customers.
2. Potential resistance from some customers due to change in interface: We are addressing this by providing clear communication about the benefits of the new portal and offering support during the transition period.

**Next Quarter Objectives**

1. Complete remaining bug fixes and re-run UAT with the pilot group.
2. Launch the updated portal for a wider customer base, starting with a controlled rollout.
3. Continue training sessions for staff and customers to ensure smooth operation of the new portal.
4. Monitor user feedback and make necessary adjustments to further improve the portal's functionality and usability.

**Resource and Budget Overview**

1. Budget usage: We are currently operating within our allocated budget, with no significant deviations expected for Q1 2025.
2. Staffing: We have maintained a dedicated team to manage the project, with additional resources allocated for training and customer support during the rollout phase.
3. Vendor collaboration: Collaboration with vendors has been productive, with successful integration of third-party services into the new portal.
4. Dependencies: Our primary dependency is the successful completion of the testing phase and the controlled rollout to customers in Q1 2025.

We appreciate your continued support and look forward to updating you on our progress in the coming quarters.
