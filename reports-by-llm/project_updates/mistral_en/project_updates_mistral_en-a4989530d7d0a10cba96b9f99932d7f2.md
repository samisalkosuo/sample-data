Current Risks and Blockers:

1. Insufficient Training: To mitigate this risk, we have allocated additional resources to our data science team for ongoing training and upskilling. We are also collaborating with NeuralTech to leverage their expertise in AI model training.
2. Data Privacy Concerns: To address these concerns, we have engaged a third-party consultant specializing in data privacy compliance to ensure that all data handling practices adhere to relevant regulations and industry standards.

Next Quarter Objectives:

1. Finalize AI Platform Contract with NeuralTech (January 2025)
2. Complete Data Collection and Preparation (February 2025)
3. Initiate AI Model Training (March 2025)
4. Conduct Initial Testing of Recommendation Engine (April 2025)

Resource and Budget Overview:

1. Budget Usage: To date, we have allocated $5 million for the project, with approximately 60% spent on procurement, team establishment, and data preparation.
2. Staffing: We have dedicated a team of 15 full-time employees to this project, with plans to expand as we move into the development phase.
3. Vendor Collaboration: In addition to NeuralTech, we are collaborating with several other vendors for data privacy compliance and infrastructure support.
4. Dependencies: Our primary dependencies include the finalization of the AI platform contract, completion of data collection and preparation, and ongoing collaboration with our vendor partners.
