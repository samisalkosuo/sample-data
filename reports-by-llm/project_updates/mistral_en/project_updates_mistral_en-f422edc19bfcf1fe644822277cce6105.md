Executive Summary:

The Digital Classroom Initiative, spearheaded by ELS, has made significant strides in Q4 2025, transitioning from the planning phase to full implementation. The project remains on track, with key milestones achieved and a positive sentiment pervading the team. Notable accomplishments include the successful deployment of digital learning platforms in over 100 pilot schools, impacting approximately 30,000 students and teachers.

Key Milestones Achieved:

1. Deployment of Digital Learning Platforms (DLP) in 100 pilot schools: With a completion rate of 95%, the DLP rollout has been successful, providing students with interactive learning experiences and teachers with tools for efficient lesson planning and grading.

2. Training Program for Teachers: A comprehensive training program was launched to familiarize educators with the new digital platforms. To date, over 80% of participating teachers have completed the training, demonstrating a strong commitment to embracing technology in education.

Current Risks and Blockers:

1. Insufficient Training: Despite the high completion rate, there remains a small percentage of teachers who require additional support to fully utilize the digital platforms. ELS is addressing this challenge by providing targeted training sessions and offering ongoing support through a dedicated helpdesk.

2. Infrastructure Challenges: Some schools have faced connectivity issues due to outdated infrastructure. ELS is collaborating with local internet service providers to upgrade network capabilities in these schools, ensuring seamless access to digital learning resources.

Next Quarter Objectives:

1. Complete DLP deployment in an additional 200 schools, impacting an estimated 60,000 students and teachers.
2. Launch a parent education program to familiarize parents with the new digital platforms and their benefits for their children's learning.
3. Continue providing targeted training sessions for underperforming teachers and offer ongoing support through the helpdesk.

Resource and Budget Overview:

1. Budget Usage: To date, 60% of the allocated budget has been expended, primarily on hardware, software, and teacher training. The remaining budget will be utilized for school infrastructure upgrades and parent education programs.
2. Staffing: ELS has hired additional project managers and technical support staff to manage the increased workload during the implementation phase. Vendor collaboration remains strong, with key partners providing essential resources and expertise.
3. Dependencies: The success of the Digital Classroom Initiative relies on continued collaboration with schools, teachers, parents, and internet service providers. ELS is actively engaging these stakeholders to ensure a smooth transition to digital learning.

In conclusion, the Digital Classroom Initiative is progressing as planned, with key milestones achieved and challenges being effectively managed. The project team remains committed to delivering a transformative digital learning experience for students across the country.
