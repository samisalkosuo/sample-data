 **Radiant Networks Q2 2023 Project Update: 5G Tower Infrastructure Buildout**

Dear Stakeholders,

I am pleased to present the Radiant Networks' Q2 2023 project update for our large-scale initiative, the 5G Tower Infrastructure Buildout. This report provides an overview of our current status, key milestones achieved, ongoing risks and blockers, next quarter objectives, and resource and budget considerations.

**Executive Summary**

The 5G Tower Infrastructure Buildout is progressing as planned, with the project currently in the testing phase. Key deliverables have been completed, including the installation of 200 towers across our target regions. We are on track with our timeline and remain optimistic about meeting our company goals for this quarter.

**Key Milestones Achieved**

- Completion of tower installations in Q1 target regions (50% of total)
- Successful integration of 5G technology into the installed towers
- Initiation of network testing and optimization processes
- Collaboration with key vendors for equipment and software support

These milestones have significantly improved our network coverage and capacity, positioning Radiant Networks as a leader in the 5G revolution.

**Current Risks and Blockers**

Despite our progress, we face challenges related to regulatory compliance in certain regions. To mitigate this risk, we are engaging with local authorities to ensure full compliance and expedite approval processes. Additionally, there is a lack of skilled technicians in some areas, which may delay the installation schedule. We are addressing this issue by partnering with vocational schools to train local talent and provide them with opportunities within our organization.

**Next Quarter Objectives**

- Complete tower installations in remaining regions (50%)
- Successfully pass network testing and optimization processes
- Initiate 5G service rollout in pilot cities
- Continue vendor collaboration for ongoing support and equipment upgrades

**Resource and Budget Overview**

Our budget allocation remains on track, with 60% of the total budget expended thus far. We have maintained an optimal staffing level, with a focus on hiring local talent to ensure efficient project execution and long-term sustainability. Vendor collaborations are progressing positively, with regular meetings scheduled to discuss ongoing requirements and future partnership opportunities.

In conclusion, we remain committed to delivering the 5G Tower Infrastructure Buildout on schedule and within budget. We appreciate your continued support and look forward to updating you on our progress in Q3.
