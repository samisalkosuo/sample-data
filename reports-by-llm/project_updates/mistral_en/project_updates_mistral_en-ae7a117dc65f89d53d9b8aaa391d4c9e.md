Core Banking Platform Upgrade Project Update

Executive Summary:

Dear Stakeholders,

We are pleased to present the Q3 2023 update for our Core Banking Platform Upgrade project at FinanceTech Solutions Inc. (FTSI). The project is currently in the Procurement phase, with significant progress made towards securing a suitable vendor partner. We are on track with our timeline and have made substantial strides in addressing key milestones, ensuring alignment with our company goals.

Key Milestones Achieved:

1. RFP (Request for Proposal) Distribution: Completed distribution of the RFP to a select pool of potential vendors, garnering responses from 20 qualified parties.
2. Vendor Evaluation: Successfully evaluated and shortlisted six vendors based on their technical capabilities, financial stability, and alignment with our company's values and objectives.
3. Negotiation and Contract Drafting: Initiated negotiations with the top three vendors, aiming to finalize contract terms by the end of Q4 2023.

The successful completion of these milestones has positioned FTSI favorably in securing a reliable vendor partner for our Core Banking Platform Upgrade project.

Current Risks and Blockers:

2. Project Kickoff: Launch the Core Banking Platform Upgrade project, marking the beginning of the Implementation phase.
3. Stakeholder Communication: Provide regular updates to stakeholders on project progress, risks, and mitigation strategies.

Resource and Budget Overview:

1. Budget Usage: To date, 20% of the allocated budget has been utilized for RFP distribution, vendor evaluation, and negotiation costs.
2. Staffing: A dedicated project team consisting of professionals from various departments is in place to oversee the procurement process and ensure seamless integration with existing systems.
3. Vendor Collaboration: Close collaboration with potential vendors has been established, with regular meetings scheduled to discuss project requirements, timelines, and expectations.
