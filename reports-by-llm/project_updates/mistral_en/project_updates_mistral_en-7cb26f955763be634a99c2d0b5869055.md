 Title: ERP Modernization Program Quarterly Update Report - Q1 2023

Dear Stakeholders,

I am pleased to present the first quarter update for our ERP Modernization Program at Stratus Manufacturing Solutions (SMS). This initiative aims to streamline our operations and enhance our competitive edge in the manufacturing sector.

**Executive Summary**

The ERP Modernization Program is progressing as planned, with key milestones achieved and a general sentiment of being on track. The implementation of the new system has commenced successfully, and we are currently in the Monitoring & Evaluation phase.

**Key Milestones Achieved**

1. System Installation: We have completed the installation of the new ERP system across all our manufacturing facilities. This milestone marks a significant step towards achieving our goal of improving operational efficiency.

2. User Training: Over 80% of our staff have been trained on the new system, ensuring a smooth transition and minimizing disruption to our operations.

3. Data Migration: We have migrated 75% of our data from the old system to the new one, with no reported data loss or corruption.

The successful completion of these milestones has positively impacted our company's goal of improving operational efficiency and reducing costs associated with outdated systems.

**Current Risks and Blockers**

1. Vendor Delays: There have been minor delays in the delivery of certain hardware components from our primary vendor. However, we have mitigated this risk by engaging a secondary vendor to ensure minimal impact on our project timeline.

2. User Adoption: While user training has been successful, there are still some resistance and apprehension among staff towards adopting the new system. To address this, we are implementing a phased rollout strategy, allowing users to gradually familiarize themselves with the new system before full adoption.

**Next Quarter Objectives**

1. Complete Data Migration: We aim to complete the migration of all data from our old system to the new one by Q2 2023.

2. Full System Implementation: By the end of Q2, we plan to have fully implemented the new ERP system across all our manufacturing facilities.

3. User Acceptance Testing: We will conduct user acceptance testing to ensure the new system meets our operational needs and addresses any identified issues or concerns.

**Resource and Budget Overview**

1. Budget Usage: To date, we have utilized 40% of our allocated budget for this project. This is within expectations given the current phase of the project.

2. Staffing: We have dedicated a team of 15 IT professionals to manage and oversee the ERP Modernization Program. Additionally, we are collaborating closely with our vendors to ensure seamless integration of hardware and software components.

3. Vendor Collaboration: Our primary vendor is working diligently to address the delays in hardware delivery, ensuring minimal impact on our project timeline.

In conclusion, while there are challenges, we remain confident that the ERP Modernization Program will deliver its intended benefits and contribute significantly to SMS's long-term success. We appreciate your continued support and look forward to updating you on our progress in Q2.
