The project remains on track, demonstrating our commitment to enhancing healthcare services and accommodating growing patient demands.

Key Milestones Achieved:

Current Risks and Blockers:

To mitigate these issues, we have engaged a third-party consultant specializing in healthcare IT integration to ensure a seamless transition.

Next Quarter Objectives:

1. Testing and Commissioning (80% completion target): We will continue testing the new hospital system, focusing on functionality, performance, and user experience. Our goal is to have 80% of the testing completed by Q3's end, allowing for thorough rectification of any identified issues before the official commissioning.

2. Staff Training (50% completion target): In parallel with testing, we will commence staff training on the new hospital system. By Q3's end, our aim is to have trained 50% of the staff who will be working in the expanded facilities.

Resource and Budget Overview:

1. Budget Usage: To date, we have utilized approximately 70% of our allocated budget for this project. This includes costs related to construction, equipment procurement, consultant fees, and staff training.

2. Staffing: We have maintained a dedicated team of professionals to oversee the various aspects of the Hospital Expansion Project. As we move into testing and commissioning phases, we will require additional resources to ensure timely completion.

3. Vendor Collaboration: Our partnerships with key vendors have been instrumental in the successful execution of this project. We continue to collaborate closely with them to address any arising challenges and ensure that our objectives are met.

4. Dependencies: The success of the Hospital Expansion Project is dependent on the seamless integration of the new hospital system with our existing infrastructure, as well as timely staff training and effective communication with patients and stakeholders throughout the transition process.
