**Edvance Learning Solutions**

Dear Stakeholders,

I am pleased to present the Campus WiFi Upgrade Project Quarterly Update for Q4 2024. Edvance Learning Solutions is committed to delivering a seamless and high-performance digital learning environment, and this project is a significant step towards that goal.

**Executive Summary**

The Campus WiFi Upgrade Project is currently in the Go-Live phase, with all campuses successfully transitioned to the new network infrastructure. The project is on track, with key progress points including the completion of hardware installation and software configuration across all campuses. The general sentiment is positive, with students and staff reporting improved connectivity and network performance.

**Key Milestones Achieved**

- Completion of hardware installation at all campuses: 100%
- Successful migration of user accounts to the new network: 98%
- Implementation of advanced network security measures: 95%
- Improvement in average network speed by 300% across all campuses

**Current Risks and Blockers**

While the project is progressing well, we have identified a few challenges that require attention. Insufficient training for some staff members has led to minor issues with network management and troubleshooting. To address this, we are organizing additional training sessions and providing comprehensive user guides.

**Next Quarter Objectives**

- Complete remaining user account migrations (2%)
- Finalize advanced network security measures (5%)
- Conduct post-implementation audits to ensure network performance and stability
- Begin planning for regular network maintenance and updates

**Resource and Budget Overview**

Budget usage remains within the allocated limits, with 80% of the budget expended primarily on hardware and software procurement. Staffing levels have been maintained, with a slight increase in IT support personnel to manage the new network infrastructure. Vendor collaboration has been effective, with timely deliveries and responsive technical support.

As we move into Q1 2025, our focus will shift towards ensuring the smooth operation of the new network and addressing any arising issues promptly. We appreciate your continued support and look forward to updating you on our progress in the coming quarters.
