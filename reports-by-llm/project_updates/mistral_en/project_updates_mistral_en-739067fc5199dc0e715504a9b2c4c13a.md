 **Healthcare Solutions Innovations (HSI) Electronic Health Record Migration Project Quarterly Update Report - Q2 2025**

Dear Stakeholders,

I am pleased to present the Q2 2025 update for our Electronic Health Record (EHR) Migration project. This initiative is a critical step towards modernizing HSI's healthcare delivery system and improving patient care.

**Executive Summary**

The EHR Migration project is currently in the System Integration phase, with key milestones achieved and overall progress on track. The team has successfully integrated the new EHR system with our existing infrastructure, ensuring seamless data flow between systems. However, we are experiencing a minor delay due to procurement holdup of certain hardware components, which is being actively managed.

**Key Milestones Achieved**

1. Successful integration of the new EHR system with our existing infrastructure (95% completion). This milestone significantly reduces the risk of data loss during migration and ensures a smooth transition for our healthcare providers.
2. Completion of user acceptance testing (UAT) for the integrated EHR system (80% completion). Feedback from users is being incorporated to refine the system before full implementation.
3. Development and deployment of training materials for staff on the new EHR system (100% completion). This will ensure a smooth transition for our healthcare providers when the new system goes live.

**Current Risks and Blockers**

1. Procurement holdup: Delays in the delivery of certain hardware components are causing minor delays in the project timeline. Our procurement team is actively working to expedite these deliveries to minimize disruption.
2. Staff training: While training materials have been developed and deployed, ensuring all staff are adequately trained before the system goes live remains a challenge due to the large number of employees involved. A comprehensive training plan is being implemented to address this issue.

**Next Quarter Objectives**

1. Complete UAT and resolve any identified issues (Q3 2025).
2. Finalize hardware procurement and ensure all components are delivered on time (Q3 2025).
3. Conduct a full-scale dry run of the new EHR system to test its readiness for implementation (Q3 2025).
4. Implement the new EHR system across all HSI facilities (Q4 2025).

**Resource and Budget Overview**

1. Budget: The project is currently within budget, with no significant unexpected expenses.
2. Staffing: The project team remains at full capacity, with additional resources being allocated for the training phase.
3. Vendor Collaboration: Close collaboration with our technology partners continues to ensure a successful migration.
4. Dependencies: Successful completion of this project depends on timely hardware deliveries and effective staff training.

We remain committed to delivering this project on time and within budget, and we appreciate your continued support and understanding as we navigate any challenges that arise.
