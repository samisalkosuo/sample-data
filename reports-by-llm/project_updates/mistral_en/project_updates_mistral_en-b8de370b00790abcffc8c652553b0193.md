### Executive Summary

During Q2 2024, the Smart Meter Installation project at ElectroNexus Utilities Corporation (ENUC) has made significant strides in the procurement phase. We are currently on track with our timeline and have successfully completed several key milestones that contribute positively to our company's strategic objectives. The overall sentiment of the project remains optimistic, with a focus on maintaining this momentum as we move into the implementation phase.

### Key Milestones Achieved

1. Vendor Selection: Following a rigorous evaluation process, we have selected three leading vendors for the supply and installation of smart meters. This decision represents a 75% completion of our procurement milestone. The chosen vendors are expected to enhance our service quality, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness.

2. Regulatory Approvals: We have secured necessary approvals from relevant regulatory bodies for the project's implementation plan, ensuring compliance with industry standards and customer protection regulations.

3. Stakeholder Engagement: Successful meetings were held with key stakeholders, including local governments, community leaders, and environmental groups, to discuss the benefits of the smart meter installation project and address any concerns related to privacy, security, and sustainability.

### Current Risks and Blockers

1. Staff Turnover: The recent departure of our Procurement Manager has created a temporary gap in project leadership. To mitigate this risk, we have assigned an interim manager with extensive experience in similar projects and are actively recruiting a permanent replacement.

2. Budget Constraints: While the project remains within budget, there is a need to closely monitor expenditures as we transition into the implementation phase, where costs are expected to increase significantly.

### Next Quarter Objectives

1. Contract Negotiation and Signing: Finalize contracts with selected vendors and secure their commitment for timely delivery and installation of smart meters.

2. Project Implementation Plan: Develop a detailed implementation plan, including milestones, deliverables, and timelines, to ensure smooth transition from procurement to implementation.

3. Staff Training: Organize training sessions for our field teams on the installation, maintenance, and troubleshooting of smart meters.

### Resource and Budget Overview

1. Budget Usage: To date, 40% of the allocated budget has been utilized primarily for vendor evaluations, regulatory approvals, and stakeholder engagement activities.

2. Staffing: The project team currently consists of 15 members, with additional resources being mobilized as we enter the implementation phase.

3. Vendor Collaboration: We have established strong relationships with our selected vendors and are working closely with them to ensure seamless integration of their solutions into our existing infrastructure.

4. Dependencies: The successful completion of the next quarter's objectives relies heavily on timely contract negotiations, effective staff training, and continued budget management.

We remain committed to delivering this project on time, within budget, and with a focus on quality and customer satisfaction.
