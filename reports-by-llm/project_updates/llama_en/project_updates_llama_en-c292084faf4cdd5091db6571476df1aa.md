**Quarterly Project Update Report: Customer Portal Migration in Insurance**

**Executive Summary**

The Customer Portal Migration project at Nova Insurance is currently in the Design Phase, having completed Q2 2024. Overall, we are on track to meet our project timeline and goals. The design phase has been productive, with significant progress made towards creating a user-centric and secure portal for our customers. However, we have encountered some challenges related to stakeholder misalignment, which are being actively managed.

**Key Milestones Achieved**

During Q2 2024, the following key milestones were achieved:

* Completion of the Requirements Gathering phase (80% complete)
* Development of a comprehensive design concept and wireframes (70% complete)
* Conducted user acceptance testing (UAT) with internal stakeholders (60% complete)

These milestones have had a significant impact on our company goals, including improved customer engagement, increased efficiency in claims processing, and enhanced data security.

**Current Risks and Blockers**

Several challenges have been identified during the design phase, including:

* Stakeholder misalignment: Some stakeholders have expressed concerns about the proposed portal's functionality and user experience. To address this, we are conducting regular stakeholder meetings to ensure that their needs are being met.
* Technical complexity: The integration of multiple third-party systems with the new portal has proven more complex than anticipated. We are working closely with our technical vendors to resolve these issues.

To mitigate these risks, we have established a dedicated project office to oversee stakeholder engagement and technical implementation. Regular progress updates and issue escalation procedures are also in place to ensure timely resolution of any challenges that arise.

**Next Quarter Objectives**

For Q3 2024, the following objectives will be focused on:

* Completion of the design phase (target completion date: end of Q3)
* Development of a functional prototype for UAT with external stakeholders
* Finalization of the project scope and timeline

Deliverables include:

* A comprehensive design document outlining the portal's architecture and user experience
* A functional prototype demonstrating the portal's key features and functionality
* An updated project schedule and resource allocation plan

**Resource and Budget Overview**

The project has been allocated a budget of $1.5 million, with a total workforce of 15 personnel. To date, we have spent approximately 60% of our allocated budget, which is within the approved scope.

Vendor collaboration has been successful, with all third-party vendors delivering high-quality services on time and to specification. However, we are closely monitoring vendor performance to ensure that costs remain within budget.

**Conclusion**

The Customer Portal Migration project at Nova Insurance is making steady progress in the design phase. While some challenges have arisen, they are being actively managed through regular stakeholder engagement and technical collaboration with our vendors. We are confident that we will meet our project timeline and goals, delivering a user-centric and secure portal for our customers.

Recommendations:

* Continue to prioritize stakeholder engagement and communication to ensure alignment with the project's objectives.
* Monitor vendor performance closely to ensure costs remain within budget.
* Conduct regular progress updates and issue escalation procedures to mitigate technical complexity and other challenges.
