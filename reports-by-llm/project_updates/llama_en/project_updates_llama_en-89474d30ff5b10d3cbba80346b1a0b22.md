**Executive Summary**

The Policy Admin System Modernization project at Nova Insurance Solutions (NIS) has made significant progress in Q1 2023, with a strong focus on system integration. The team has successfully completed several key milestones, and the overall sentiment remains positive. However, some challenges have arisen during the integration phase, which are being actively managed.

**Key Milestones Achieved**

During Q1 2023, the NIS project team achieved the following key milestones:

* Completion of the system architecture design (80% complete)
* Successful integration testing with third-party vendors (70% complete)
* Development and deployment of custom integrations for policy management and claims processing (60% complete)

These achievements have positively impacted company goals by reducing manual processes, increasing data accuracy, and enhancing overall operational efficiency. The team has also made significant progress in reducing the time-to-market for new policies, resulting in improved customer satisfaction.

**Current Risks and Blockers**

Several challenges have been identified during the integration phase, including:

* Complexity of integrating with multiple third-party systems
* Limited availability of critical data from legacy systems
* Insufficient testing resources to ensure thorough validation

To address these challenges, the NIS project team has implemented additional testing protocols, collaborated closely with vendors to resolve data issues, and allocated dedicated resources for quality assurance. The team is also exploring alternative solutions to mitigate potential risks associated with integration complexities.

**Next Quarter Objectives**

In Q2 2023, the NIS project team aims to:

* Complete system integration testing (90% complete)
* Deploy custom integrations for policy management and claims processing (80% complete)
* Conduct thorough user acceptance testing (UAT) with key stakeholders

These objectives are critical to ensuring a smooth transition to the new Policy Admin System Modernization, which is expected to be completed by Q4 2023.

**Resource and Budget Overview**

The NIS project team has made efficient use of allocated resources, including:

* Staffing: The team has maintained a stable workforce of 15 personnel, with an average utilization rate of 85%.
* Vendor collaboration: NIS has established strong partnerships with key vendors, ensuring timely delivery of critical components.
