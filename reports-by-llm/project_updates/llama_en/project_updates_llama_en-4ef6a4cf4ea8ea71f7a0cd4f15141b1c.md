**Omnichannel Sales System Launch Project Update Report**

**Company Name:** Azura Retail Solutions (ARS)

**Project Title:** Omnichannel Sales System Launch

**Quarterly Report: Q3 2024**

**Executive Summary:**
The Omnichannel Sales System Launch project is currently in the Design Phase, with a total of three quarters completed. Overall, we are on track to meet our project timeline and milestones. However, there have been some minor delays and budget adjustments due to unforeseen complexities in the design phase.

Key progress points include:

* Completion of the business requirements gathering (BRG) phase
* Development of the system architecture and technical specifications
* Conducting stakeholder workshops and user acceptance testing (UAT)

The project team has made significant progress, but we are still awaiting finalization of the design documents. We expect to complete the design phase by the end of Q3 2024.

**Key Milestones Achieved:**

| Milestone | Completion Percentage | Impact on Company Goals |
| --- | --- | --- |
| BRG Phase | 80% | Informing system requirements and ensuring alignment with business objectives |
| System Architecture Development | 70% | Providing a solid foundation for the system's technical implementation |
| Stakeholder Workshops | 90% | Ensuring stakeholder buy-in and understanding of the system's capabilities |

**Current Risks and Blockers:**
Several challenges have arisen during the design phase, including:

* Budget overruns due to unforeseen complexity in the design phase (5% above original budget allocation)
* Delays in vendor collaboration, resulting in a 2-week extension to the project timeline
* Changes in stakeholder requirements, requiring additional design iterations

To mitigate these risks, we have:

* Conducted regular progress meetings with stakeholders and vendors to ensure alignment and address concerns
* Implemented a change management process to minimize the impact of changes on the project timeline and budget
* Adjusted our resource allocation to accommodate the increased complexity in the design phase

**Next Quarter Objectives:**
To stay on track, we will focus on:

* Finalizing the system design documents by the end of Q3 2024
* Completing the development of the system architecture and technical specifications
* Conducting UAT with a subset of stakeholders to validate the system's functionality and performance

**Deliverables:**

* System design documents (finalized by the end of Q3 2024)
* System architecture and technical specifications (completed by the end of Q3 2024)
* UAT report (completed by the end of Q1 2025)

**Timeline:**
Q3 2024: Finalize system design documents, complete system architecture and technical specifications
Q4 2024: Conduct UAT with stakeholders, validate system functionality and performance

**Resource and Budget Overview:**
We have allocated a total budget of $2.5 million for the project, with a current expenditure of $1.8 million (72% of allocated budget). Our resource allocation includes:

* Project Manager: 20 hours/week
* Design Lead: 15 hours/week
* Development Team: 40 hours/week
* Vendor Collaboration: Ongoing

We are working closely with our vendors to ensure timely delivery of the system components and to minimize any potential delays.

In conclusion, while there have been some minor challenges in the design phase, we remain on track to meet our project timeline and milestones. We will continue to monitor progress, address any emerging risks, and adjust our plans as necessary to ensure a successful Omnichannel Sales System Launch for Azura Retail Solutions.
