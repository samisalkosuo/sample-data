**Quarterly Project Update Report: Claims Automation Engine**

**Executive Summary**

The Claims Automation Engine (CAE) project, undertaken by Nova Insurance Solutions, has reached its Q3 2024 milestone. The current status of the project is behind schedule due to unforeseen delays in vendor collaboration and lack of executive support. Despite these challenges, the team remains committed to delivering a successful CAE solution that aligns with Nova's strategic objectives.

**Key Milestones Achieved**

| Milestone | Completion Percentage | Impact on Company Goals |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Requirements Gathering | 30% | Established a comprehensive understanding of business requirements, enabling informed design decisions. |
| Solution Architecture Design | 20% | Developed a scalable and efficient solution architecture, ensuring seamless integration with existing systems. |

The completion percentage for these milestones is lower than expected due to the aforementioned delays in vendor collaboration and lack of executive support.

**Current Risks and Blockers**

1. **Lack of Executive Support**: Insufficient sponsorship from senior management has hindered the project's progress. Efforts are being made to address this issue through regular updates and re-emphasis on the project's strategic importance.
2. **Vendor Collaboration Challenges**: Delays in vendor response times and communication have impacted the project timeline. The team is working closely with vendors to resolve these issues and ensure timely delivery of critical components.

To mitigate these risks, the project team has established a dedicated stakeholder management plan, ensuring regular updates and progress reports are shared with senior management and key stakeholders.

**Next Quarter Objectives**

1. **Vendor Collaboration**: Strengthen relationships with key vendors through regular communication and issue escalation procedures.
2. **Requirements Refinement**: Finalize requirements gathering by completing the development of detailed use cases and acceptance criteria.
3. **Solution Design**: Complete solution architecture design, including the development of a functional prototype.

**Deliverables and Timelines**

* Vendor collaboration plan: Q4 2024
* Requirements refinement: Q1 2025 (by end of quarter)
* Solution design completion: Q2 2025

**Resource and Budget Overview**

The project has experienced some budget overruns due to unforeseen delays in vendor collaboration. However, the team has managed to optimize resource allocation, ensuring that all necessary personnel are utilized efficiently.

Vendor collaboration costs have increased by 15% compared to initial estimates. To mitigate this impact, the project team is exploring cost-saving measures and renegotiating contracts with key vendors.

**Conclusion**

The Claims Automation Engine project faces challenges in Q3 2024 due to lack of executive support and vendor collaboration issues. Despite these setbacks, the team remains committed to delivering a successful CAE solution that aligns with Nova's strategic objectives. The next quarter will focus on strengthening vendor relationships, refining requirements, and completing solution design.

Recommendations:

* Increase executive visibility and sponsorship for the project
