**Regulatory Submissions Portal Project Update Report**

**Company:** Novasyn Pharmaceuticals Inc.

**Quarterly Period:** July 1, 2023 - September 30, 2023 (Q3 2023)

**Executive Summary:**
The Regulatory Submissions Portal project for Novasyn Pharmaceuticals Inc. is currently in the System Integration phase. Overall, we are on track to meet our project timeline and milestones. However, there have been some minor delays due to vendor coordination and testing complexities. Our team has made significant progress, and we are confident that the portal will be successfully integrated by the end of Q4 2023.

**Key Milestones Achieved:**

1. **System Design Completion**: The system design was completed on time, with a 95% completion rate (Q2 2023). This milestone has enabled our team to move forward with integration testing.
2. **Integration Testing Initiation**: Integration testing began in Q3 2023 and is expected to be completed by the end of the quarter. This phase will ensure that all system components are working seamlessly together.
3. **User Acceptance Testing (UAT) Preparation**: UAT preparations are underway, with a planned completion date of December 2023.

**Percentage of Completion:** As of Q3 2023, the project is at 75% completion.

**Impact on Company Goals:**
The Regulatory Submissions Portal will significantly enhance our company's regulatory compliance and efficiency. By streamlining the submission process, we expect to reduce processing times by 30% and increase accuracy rates by 25%.

**Current Risks and Blockers:**

1. **Procurement Holdup**: There was a minor delay in receiving necessary equipment from our vendor due to production capacity constraints. Our team has worked closely with the vendor to expedite delivery, and we expect to receive the equipment by the end of Q3.
2. **Testing Complexity**: Integration testing is proving more complex than anticipated, requiring additional resources and time. We are working closely with our vendors to resolve these issues.

**Next Quarter Objectives:**

1. **Integration Testing Completion**: Complete integration testing by the end of Q4 2023.
2. **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**: Begin UAT in January 2024, with a planned completion date of March 2024.
3. **System Deployment**: Plan for system deployment in April 2024, pending successful UAT.

**Resource and Budget Overview:**
Our team has been working diligently to ensure the project's success. We have:

* Utilized 80% of our allocated budget for Q3 2023.
* Maintained a staff-to-project ratio of 1:2, ensuring adequate resources for each task.
* Collaborated effectively with vendors to resolve issues and meet deadlines.

We are on track to meet our project timeline and milestones. However, we will continue to monitor progress closely and make adjustments as necessary to ensure the successful delivery of the Regulatory Submissions Portal.

**Recommendations:**

1. Continue to prioritize vendor collaboration and communication.
2. Monitor testing complexity and adjust resources accordingly.
3. Review and refine the UAT plan to ensure a smooth transition to production.

We will provide a detailed project update report for Q4 2023 in December 2023, highlighting progress, challenges, and future objectives.
