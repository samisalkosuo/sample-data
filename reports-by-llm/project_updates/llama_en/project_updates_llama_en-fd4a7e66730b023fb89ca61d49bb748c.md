**Executive Summary**

The Patient Portal Implementation project at MedTech Solutions Inc., a leading healthcare technology provider, has reached a significant milestone in its deployment phase. As we enter Q4 2025, the project is on track to meet its overall objectives, with some minor adjustments made to address emerging challenges.
