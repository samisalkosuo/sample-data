**Quarterly Project Update Report: Core Banking Platform Upgrade**

**Executive Summary**

The Core Banking Platform Upgrade project, undertaken by NovaBank Limited, a leading financial institution in the region, has reached the Monitoring & Evaluation phase. As we enter Q2 2023, the overall project status is considered on track. Key progress points include the successful completion of the system integration phase and the deployment of the new core banking platform to a pilot group of users. However, some challenges have arisen, including procurement holdups and vendor collaboration issues.

**Key Milestones Achieved**

During Q1 2023, NovaBank Limited achieved the following key milestones:

* Completion of system integration with 85% accuracy (target: 90%)
* Successful deployment of the new core banking platform to a pilot group of users (target: 20)
* Conducted thorough testing and quality assurance with 95% pass rate (target: 92%)

These achievements have positively impacted NovaBank Limited's ability to enhance customer experience, improve operational efficiency, and increase competitiveness in the market.

**Current Risks and Blockers**

Several challenges have been identified during Q1 2023:

* Procurement holdup: The vendor selection process has been delayed due to unforeseen issues with one of the shortlisted vendors. NovaBank Limited is working closely with the remaining vendors to expedite the procurement process.
* Vendor collaboration issues: Communication breakdowns between NovaBank Limited and some of its vendors have hindered progress in certain areas. Efforts are being made to re-establish open communication channels.

To mitigate these risks, NovaBank Limited has established a dedicated project office to oversee the procurement process and facilitate regular meetings with vendors to address concerns and ensure timely delivery.

**Next Quarter Objectives**

In Q2 2023, NovaBank Limited aims to:

* Complete the procurement process for all remaining vendors (target: end of Q2)
* Conduct thorough testing and quality assurance for the new core banking platform (target: mid-Q2)
* Deploy the new core banking platform to the entire user base (target: late Q2)

**Resource and Budget Overview**

NovaBank Limited has allocated sufficient resources and budget to ensure the successful completion of the project. The current resource allocation stands at:

* In-house staff: 80% of total personnel
* Vendor collaboration: 15% of total personnel
* External consultants: 5% of total personnel

The budget for Q2 2023 is expected to be approximately $1.8 million, which will cover the costs associated with procurement, testing, and deployment.

In conclusion, while some challenges have arisen during Q1 2023, NovaBank Limited remains committed to delivering a successful Core Banking Platform Upgrade project. With careful risk management, effective communication, and focused resource allocation, we are confident that we will meet our objectives for Q2 2023 and beyond.

**Recommendations**

Based on the current status of the project, I recommend:

* Continuing to monitor procurement holdups closely and exploring alternative vendor options if necessary
* Enhancing communication channels with vendors to prevent similar issues in the future
* Maintaining a flexible resource allocation plan to accommodate any unexpected challenges that may arise

I look forward to providing regular updates on the project's progress and addressing any questions or concerns you may have.
