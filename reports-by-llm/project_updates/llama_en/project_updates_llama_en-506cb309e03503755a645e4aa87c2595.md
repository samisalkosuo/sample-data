**Executive Summary**

The Policy Admin System Modernization project at Nova Insurance Solutions (NIS) has made significant progress in Q1 2025, with a strong foundation laid for the Requirements Gathering phase. The team has successfully completed several key milestones, and we are on track to meet our overall project objectives.

Key Milestones Achieved:

* Completed a comprehensive needs assessment of the current Policy Admin System (PAS) to identify areas for improvement and opportunities for modernization.
* Conducted stakeholder interviews with key business users, including underwriters, claims adjusters, and policy administrators, to gather requirements for the new system.
* Developed a detailed project plan, including timelines, milestones, and resource allocation.

Percentage of Completion: 30%

Impact on Company Goals:

The successful completion of these milestones has enabled NIS to better understand its current PAS limitations and identify opportunities for process improvements. The new system will enhance operational efficiency, reduce errors, and improve customer satisfaction.

Current Risks and Blockers:

* Scope creep: The project team is working closely with stakeholders to ensure that all requirements are captured and prioritized correctly.
* Vendor selection: NIS has identified several vendors for the PAS modernization project, but final selections will be made in Q2 2025. The team is conducting thorough due diligence to ensure the chosen vendor meets our quality and security standards.

To mitigate these risks, we have established a regular stakeholder update process and are maintaining open communication channels with our vendors.

Next Quarter Objectives:

* Finalize PAS requirements documentation (RFP) by Q2 2025.
* Conduct a detailed analysis of existing data migration processes to ensure seamless integration with the new system.
* Begin vendor selection and due diligence for PAS implementation.

* Data migration analysis: Q3 2025, with a target date of June 30th, 2025.
* Vendor selection and due diligence: Ongoing, with final selections expected by August 31st, 2025.

Resource and Budget Overview:

The project team has been allocated sufficient resources to support the Requirements Gathering phase. We have also established a budget for PAS modernization, which includes vendor fees, consulting services, and system implementation costs.

Budget usage: As of Q1 2025, we have spent 20% of our allocated budget, with 80% remaining for future phases of the project.

Staffing:

The project team consists of experienced professionals from various departments within NIS. We have also engaged external consultants to support specific aspects of the project.
