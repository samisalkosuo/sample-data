**Executive Summary**

The ERP Modernization Program at NovaTech Industries (NTI), a leading manufacturer of industrial equipment, has reached its mid-point in Q2 2024. The project is currently in the Initiation phase, with a focus on defining the scope, requirements, and overall strategy for the modernization effort.

Overall, the project is on track to meet its objectives, with key stakeholders engaged and committed to the initiative. However, there are some challenges that require attention to ensure successful delivery. The general sentiment among team members is positive, with a sense of excitement and anticipation for the benefits that the new ERP system will bring.

**Key Milestones Achieved**

During Q2 2024, the following key milestones have been achieved:

1. **Business Requirements Gathering**: A comprehensive business requirements gathering (BRG) process has been completed, involving stakeholder interviews, workshops, and surveys to gather detailed information on NTI's current processes, systems, and pain points.
2. **Scope Definition**: The project scope has been defined, including the identification of functional and non-functional requirements, as well as the development of a high-level system architecture.
3. **Stakeholder Engagement**: Regular stakeholder meetings have been held to ensure that all key stakeholders are informed and engaged throughout the project.

The percentage of completion is approximately 30%, with the next quarter expected to see significant progress on the scope definition, requirements gathering, and stakeholder engagement.

**Current Risks and Blockers**

Several risks and blockers have been identified, including:

1. **Lack of Executive Support**: While senior management has expressed interest in the project, there is a need for more formalized support and commitment to ensure the project's success.
2. **Vendor Selection**: The selection process for ERP vendors is ongoing, with multiple options being considered. However, there are concerns about the complexity of the evaluation process and the potential for delays.

To mitigate these risks, the project team has established a risk management plan, which includes regular progress updates to senior management, as well as a contingency planning approach to address any unexpected issues that may arise.
