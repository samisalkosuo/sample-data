**Executive Summary**

The Customer Portal Migration project at Nova Insurance has successfully completed its Go-Live phase and entered the Post-Go-Live Support period. As we reflect on Q1 2025, I am pleased to report that the project is on track to meet its overall objectives.

Key progress points include:

* Successful completion of the migration process, with all customer portals now live and functional.
* Implementation of robust security measures to protect sensitive customer data.
* Effective training programs for end-users, resulting in high adoption rates.

However, we have encountered some challenges that require attention. Staff turnover has been a significant issue, affecting our ability to provide timely support to customers. We are working closely with HR to address this issue and ensure that our team is adequately staffed.

Overall sentiment remains positive, with the project team demonstrating resilience and adaptability in the face of challenges.

**Key Milestones Achieved**

**Resource and Budget Overview**

Budget usage: We have allocated 95% of our budget for the project, with a remaining 5% reserved for contingency planning. (Actual spend: $1.2M, vs. budgeted $1.2M.)

Staffing: Our team has been adequately staffed to support the post-go-live phase. However, we are monitoring staffing levels closely to ensure that we can respond effectively to customer queries.

Vendor collaboration: We have established clear communication channels with our vendors and are working collaboratively to address any issues that arise.
