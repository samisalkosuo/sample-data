**Executive Summary:**
The Patient Portal Implementation project for NovaHealthcare Solutions Inc. is currently in the System Integration phase, with a total of 75% completion rate as of Q1 2025. The project is on track to meet its overall objectives, but some delays have been experienced due to vendor coordination and testing complexities.

2. **Integration Testing**: 80% completion rate, with an estimated additional 4 weeks required to complete testing.
3. **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**: Scheduled for Q2 2025, with a target completion date of March 31st.

**Impact on Company Goals:**

The patient portal system is expected to improve patient engagement, reduce administrative burdens, and enhance the overall quality of care provided by NovaHealthcare Solutions Inc. We are confident that these benefits will be realized once the system is fully integrated and operational.

**Current Risks and Blockers:**
Several challenges have been identified during this quarter:

1. **Vendor Coordination**: Delays in receiving necessary documentation from our vendors have impacted testing timelines.
2. **Budget Overruns**: Unexpected expenses related to custom development and testing have resulted in a 5% increase in the overall budget.
3. **Staffing**: Temporary staffing shortages have affected our ability to complete tasks efficiently, particularly during peak testing periods.

To mitigate these risks, we are:

1. **Re-negotiating vendor contracts** to ensure timely delivery of necessary documentation.
2. **Implementing cost-saving measures**, such as reducing non-essential travel and optimizing resource allocation.
3. **Recruiting temporary staff** to support our team during peak testing periods.

**Next Quarter Objectives:**
To ensure successful completion of the project, we will focus on:

1. **Completing Integration Testing**: Achieve 100% completion rate by Q2 2025.
2. **Conducting User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**: Schedule UAT for March 31st, with a target completion date of April 30th.
3. **Finalizing System Deployment**: Plan for system deployment on May 15th, with a phased rollout to ensure minimal disruption to our operations.

**Resource and Budget Overview:**
Our team has utilized approximately 60% of the allocated budget, with an estimated remaining budget of $1.2 million. We have also experienced some staffing shortages, but have implemented measures to mitigate these effects.

In conclusion, we are confident that NovaHealthcare Solutions Inc. will successfully implement its patient portal system by the end of Q2 2025. We appreciate the support and trust placed in us by our stakeholders and look forward to delivering a high-quality solution that meets their needs.
