**Project Update Report: Clinical Trial Data Platform**

**Company:** NovaPharma Solutions Inc.

**Quarterly Period:** Q3 2025

**Executive Summary:**
The Clinical Trial Data Platform (CTDP) project is currently in the Requirements Gathering phase, with a total of 120 working days completed out of the planned 360 days. The team has made significant progress in defining the platform's functional and non-functional requirements, which will serve as the foundation for the subsequent development phases. While some delays are anticipated due to the complexity of the project, we remain on track to deliver the CTDP by the end of Q4 2026.

**Key Milestones Achieved:**

1. **Requirements Gathering Phase Completion:** The team has completed the requirements gathering phase, resulting in a comprehensive set of functional and non-functional requirements for the platform.
2. **Domain Expert Interviews:** Conducted 30 domain expert interviews to validate the requirements and gather additional insights from key stakeholders.
3. **Use Case Development:** Developed 50 use cases that outline the platform's user interactions and workflows.

Percentage of Completion: 33%

Impact on Company Goals:

* The CTDP will enable NovaPharma Solutions Inc. to improve data management, reduce costs, and enhance regulatory compliance for its clinical trials.
* The platform is expected to increase operational efficiency by 25% and reduce data errors by 30%.

**Current Risks and Blockers:**

1. **Integration Issues:** Integration with existing systems, such as Electronic Data Capture (EDC) and Clinical Trial Management Systems (CTMS), poses a significant challenge. To mitigate this risk, the team is working closely with vendors to develop custom interfaces and APIs.
2. **Data Quality Concerns:** Ensuring data quality and integrity across different sources and formats is a concern. The team is implementing robust data validation and cleansing processes to address this issue.

**Next Quarter Objectives:**

1. **Requirements Refinement:** Refine the requirements based on feedback from domain experts, stakeholders, and internal review.
2. **Use Case Development:** Develop an additional 20 use cases to further validate the platform's functionality.
3. **High-Level Design:** Create a high-level design document outlining the platform's architecture, data models, and technical infrastructure.

**Timeline:**

* Q4 2025: Requirements refinement and use case development
* Q1 2026: High-level design and prototype development

**Resource and Budget Overview:**
The project is being managed by a team of 15 full-time employees, with the following resource allocation:

* 8 developers
* 3 quality assurance engineers
* 2 domain experts
* 2 project managers

Budget usage for Q3 2025 is 75% of the allocated budget, with an expected total cost of $12 million.

Vendor collaboration is ongoing, with partnerships established with key vendors to ensure timely delivery of critical components. Dependencies on external factors, such as regulatory changes and technology advancements, are being closely monitored to minimize potential risks.

In conclusion, while some challenges remain, the Clinical Trial Data Platform project is progressing according to plan. We will continue to monitor progress, address risks, and adapt to changing requirements to ensure successful delivery of this critical initiative for NovaPharma Solutions Inc.
