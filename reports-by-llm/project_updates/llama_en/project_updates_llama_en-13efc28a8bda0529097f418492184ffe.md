**Quarter:** Q2 2024

**Executive Summary:**
The Factory Automation Overhaul project is currently in the Requirements Gathering phase, with a total of 12 weeks completed out of the planned 40 weeks. The team has made significant progress in understanding the manufacturing processes and identifying areas for improvement. However, we are facing some challenges in data quality issues, which may impact our ability to deliver on time.

**Key Milestones Achieved:**

1. **Process Mapping:** Completed process mapping for all production lines, with a 95% accuracy rate.
2. **Requirements Gathering:** Conducted stakeholder interviews and workshops, resulting in a comprehensive set of requirements (80% complete).
3. **System Selection:** Shortlisted three potential automation systems, with a recommended solution to be presented to the executive team.

**Percentage of Completion:** 30%

**Impact on Company Goals:**
The project is expected to reduce production downtime by 25%, increase productivity by 15%, and improve product quality by 10%. These improvements are aligned with NovaTech Industries Inc.'s strategic objectives for process efficiency and customer satisfaction.

**Current Risks and Blockers:**

1. **Data Quality Issues:** Inconsistent data from various sources is hindering our ability to accurately model production processes.
2. **Vendor Collaboration:** Delays in receiving necessary documentation from automation system vendors are impacting our timeline.
3. **Stakeholder Buy-In:** Some stakeholders are expressing concerns about the potential impact of automation on jobs, which may affect project adoption.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

1. **Data Quality:** Implemented data validation checks and established a data governance framework to ensure consistency.
2. **Vendor Collaboration:** Established regular communication channels with vendors and negotiated extensions for documentation delivery.
3. **Stakeholder Engagement:** Conducted workshops and presentations to address stakeholder concerns and provide transparent project updates.

**Next Quarter Objectives:**
