**Key Milestones Achieved**

During Q3 2024, our team achieved the following key milestones:

1. **RFP Development**: We completed the development of a comprehensive Request for Proposal (RFP) document, which outlines the requirements for the new policy administration system.
2. **Vendor Shortlisting**: Our procurement team shortlisted three vendors who have demonstrated the necessary expertise and capabilities to meet our project requirements.
3. **System Design**: We conducted a thorough analysis of the existing system and identified areas for improvement, which will inform the design of the new system.

The percentage of completion is approximately 60%, with the majority of this progress attributed to the RFP development and vendor shortlisting activities.

**Impact on Company Goals**

The successful implementation of the Policy Admin System Modernization project aligns with Nova Insurance Solutions' strategic objectives:
