The Requirements Gathering phase is nearing completion, and the team is actively engaging with stakeholders to finalize the project scope and deliverables. While some minor delays have occurred due to procurement holdups, the overall sentiment remains positive, with the team committed to delivering a high-quality solution that meets NES's strategic objectives.

**Key Milestones Achieved**

* Completion of 70% of Requirements Gathering activities
* Successful completion of 40% of Technical Design and Planning tasks
* Establishment of partnerships with key vendors for WiFi infrastructure and network services

These milestones demonstrate the team's progress in understanding the project requirements, defining technical specifications, and securing necessary resources. The completed Requirements Gathering phase will provide a solid foundation for the subsequent phases, ensuring that NES can deliver a comprehensive and integrated WiFi solution.

**Current Risks and Blockers**

* Procurement holdup: A minor delay has occurred due to unforeseen issues with one of our key vendors. The team is working closely with the vendor to resolve the issue and is exploring alternative solutions.
* Staffing constraints: The project team is facing some challenges in recruiting specialized talent, particularly for network architecture and security expertise. NES is actively engaging with recruitment agencies and exploring internal opportunities to address this gap.

To mitigate these risks, NES has established a contingency plan, which includes:

* Regular communication with vendors to ensure timely delivery of critical components
* Temporary staffing arrangements to bridge the skills gap until permanent positions are filled

**Next Quarter Objectives**

Q4 2025 will focus on completing the Requirements Gathering phase and commencing Technical Design and Planning activities. Key objectives include:

* Completing 100% of Requirements Gathering activities by December 31, 2025
* Finalizing technical specifications for WiFi infrastructure and network services by January 15, 2026
* Establishing a detailed project timeline and resource allocation plan

**Resource and Budget Overview**

The NES project team has been allocated a budget of $1.2 million for the Campus WiFi Upgrade project. To date, approximately 30% of this budget has been spent on Requirements Gathering activities, with an additional 20% committed to Technical Design and Planning tasks.

NES is pleased with the progress made so far and is confident that the team will meet its objectives within the allocated budget. However, the procurement holdup and staffing constraints have resulted in some minor cost overruns, which are being closely monitored by the project management team.
