**Current Risks and Blockers**

Several challenges have been identified during the testing phase, including:

* Vendor dependencies: Delays in receiving critical components from vendors have caused minor delays in the testing process. GreenMart Inc. is working closely with vendors to expedite delivery and minimize impact.

To mitigate these risks, additional training sessions have been scheduled for operations staff, and contingency plans have been developed to address potential vendor delays.

**Next Quarter Objectives**

The next quarter (Q2) will focus on:

* Completing testing and validation of the POS system
* Conducting user acceptance testing with key stakeholders
* Implementing the new system across all stores

Deliverables include:

* Completion of testing and validation by end of Q2
* User acceptance testing with key stakeholders completed by end of Q3
* Implementation of the new system across all stores by end of Q4

**Resource and Budget Overview**

The project has been allocated a budget of $1.5 million, with a total workforce of 20 personnel involved in the implementation.

To date, the project has utilized approximately 70% of its allocated budget, with the majority spent on development and testing costs.

Vendor collaboration has been successful, with all critical vendors providing timely delivery of components. However, additional resources have been allocated to ensure that vendor dependencies are managed effectively.

The project timeline remains on track, with minor delays anticipated due to vendor dependencies. GreenMart Inc. is confident that the new POS system will deliver significant benefits to the company, including improved operational efficiency, enhanced customer experience, and increased sales.
