**Executive Summary**

The Billing System Replacement project at NovaTel, a leading telecommunications provider, has made significant progress in Q1 2024. The project is currently in the Monitoring & Evaluation phase, with all major deliverables completed and testing underway. Overall, we are on track to meet the project timeline and budget, with some minor delays anticipated in the next quarter.

Key Milestones Achieved:

* Completion of system design and architecture (80% complete)
* Successful deployment of new billing software (90% complete)

Impact on Company Goals:
The new billing system is expected to improve revenue accuracy, reduce manual errors, and enhance customer experience. These improvements are anticipated to result in a 5% increase in revenue growth and a 10% reduction in operational costs.

Current Risks and Blockers:

* Vendor collaboration: We have experienced some delays in receiving critical components from our vendors. To mitigate this, we have increased our vendor management team's frequency of meetings and are working closely with them to prioritize delivery schedules.

Next Quarter Objectives:

Resource and Budget Overview:

* Staffing: Our project team has grown to 12 members, including 2 additional vendors providing support services. We anticipate this growth will continue as the project progresses.
* Vendor collaboration: We have established strong relationships with our vendors and are confident in their ability to deliver critical components on time.
