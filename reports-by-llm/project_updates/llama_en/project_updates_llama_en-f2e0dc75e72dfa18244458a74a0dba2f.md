To mitigate these risks, we are working closely with the executive team to secure additional funding and exploring alternative vendor options.

**Resource and Budget Overview:**
We have managed the project budget effectively, with a total expenditure of $120 million, exceeding our initial estimate of $100 million. The additional funding has enabled us to complete some critical upgrades, but we are working closely with the executive team to ensure that all costs are justified.

Vendor collaboration has been a challenge, but we have secured alternative vendors for some critical components, ensuring minimal disruption to the project timeline.

**Conclusion:**
The New Logistics Center Build project is making excellent progress, and we are confident that it will meet its overall objectives. However, we must continue to address the challenges identified in this report to ensure successful completion. We will maintain close communication with stakeholders and provide regular updates on our progress.
