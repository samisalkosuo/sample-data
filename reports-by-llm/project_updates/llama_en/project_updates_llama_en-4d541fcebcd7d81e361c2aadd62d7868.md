**Impact on Company Goals:**

The successful completion of these milestones has positively impacted our company goals by:

* Improving operational efficiency and reducing manual errors
* Positioning us for increased market share in the financial services sector

**Current Risks and Blockers:**
Several integration challenges have been identified, including:

1. **Integration with Existing Systems:** Integration with our existing customer relationship management (CRM) system is proving to be more complex than anticipated.
2. **Data Migration:** Data migration from our legacy systems to the new wealth management suite is a significant undertaking.

To mitigate these risks, we are working closely with our vendors and internal teams to:

* Develop custom integration solutions
* Implement data mapping and validation processes

**Next Quarter Objectives:**

3. **Integration Testing:** Initiate integration testing with our existing systems.

**Timeline:**

* Q2 EOD: Development phase completion
* Q3 EOD: Integration testing completion
* Q4 EOD: Project completion and go-live

**Resource and Budget Overview:**
Our project team consists of 15 full-time employees, including developers, testers, and project managers. We have allocated a budget of $1.5 million for the project, with a contingency fund of $200,000 to cover any unexpected expenses.

Vendor collaboration has been successful, with our vendors providing high-quality services and support. However, we are experiencing some delays in receiving critical components from our third-party vendors, which may impact our project timeline.

**Conclusion:**
The Wealth Management Suite Deployment project for Nova Financial Solutions is on track to meet its project timeline and goals. While some integration challenges have been identified, we are actively managing these risks and working closely with our vendors and internal teams to ensure a successful delivery. We look forward to completing the project by Q4 EOD and delivering a robust and scalable wealth management solution to our clients.
