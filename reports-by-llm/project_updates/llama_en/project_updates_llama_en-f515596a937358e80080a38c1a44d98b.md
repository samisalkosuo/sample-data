**Quarterly Project Update Report: Core Banking Platform Upgrade**

**Executive Summary**

The Core Banking Platform Upgrade project at NovaBank, a leading financial institution in the region, has made significant progress during Q1 2024. The project is currently in the testing phase, and while some challenges have arisen, we are on track to meet our overall objectives. Our team has worked diligently to address scope creep and ensure that all deliverables are completed to the highest standards.

**Key Milestones Achieved**

During Q1 2024, our team achieved the following key milestones:

* Completion of the system architecture design (80% complete)
* Successful integration of the new core banking platform with existing systems (70% complete)
* Development and testing of critical business processes (60% complete)

These milestones have had a significant impact on NovaBank's ability to improve operational efficiency, enhance customer experience, and reduce costs. The completion of these deliverables has also enabled us to move forward with the testing phase, which is currently underway.

**Current Risks and Blockers**

While we are making good progress, there are some challenges that require our attention:

* Scope creep: As expected, some stakeholders have requested additional features and functionalities that were not initially included in the project scope. Our team has worked closely with these stakeholders to prioritize and refine the requirements, ensuring that we stay on track.
* Vendor collaboration: We have experienced some delays in receiving critical components from our vendors. Our team has established a dedicated point of contact to ensure timely delivery of these components and has implemented a contingency plan to mitigate any potential impact.

To manage these risks, we are:

* Conducting regular project reviews with stakeholders to ensure that all requirements are clearly understood and prioritized
* Establishing clear communication channels with vendors to ensure timely delivery of critical components
* Developing a comprehensive risk management plan to address any unexpected issues that may arise

**Next Quarter Objectives**

In Q2 2024, our team will focus on the following objectives:

* Complete the testing phase (target completion date: June 30, 2024)
* Conduct thorough quality assurance and validation of all deliverables
* Develop a comprehensive training program for end-users to ensure a smooth transition to the new core banking platform

**Resource and Budget Overview**

Our team has worked diligently to manage the project budget and resources effectively. We have:

* Utilized 75% of our allocated budget, with a projected savings of $1.2 million compared to the original estimate
* Maintained a staff-to-project ratio of 1:3, ensuring that we have sufficient personnel to complete all deliverables on time
* Collaborated closely with vendors to ensure timely delivery of critical components and to optimize costs

We are pleased with our progress and are confident that we will meet our objectives for Q2 2024. If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to reach out.

**Recommendations**

Based on the current project status, I recommend that the project sponsor:

* Approve the revised project timeline, which takes into account the completion of testing and quality assurance
* Provide additional resources to support the training program for end-users
* Review and approve the comprehensive risk management plan to ensure that we are adequately prepared to address any unexpected issues that may arise

Thank you for your continued support.
