- Purpose of Inspection: Routine safety and compliance check

**4. Observations and Findings**

*Structural:*  
The building's reinforced concrete frame shows signs of minor cracking, consistent with age and thermal expansion/contraction cycles. The timber flooring is in good condition but requires periodic maintenance to prevent moisture-related issues.

*Electrical:*  
The electrical system appears outdated, featuring fuse boxes instead of modern circuit breakers. Wiring insulation shows some deterioration, necessitating replacement for safety.

*Plumbing:*  
Galvanized steel pipes exhibit signs of corrosion and reduced water flow. Recommend replacing with more durable materials like copper or PEX.

*HVAC:*  
The heating system, a vintage oil-fired boiler, is functional but inefficient. Consider upgrading to a modern, energy-efficient solution for compliance with current environmental standards.

*Fire Safety:*  
Smoke detectors are present on each floor but require battery replacement and testing. Fire extinguishers are located but some appear expired; all should be checked and renewed as per regulations.

*Accessibility:*  
The building lacks ramp access for wheelchair users, failing to meet current accessibility standards. Installation of a ramp or lift is recommended.

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

- Address structural cracking with monitoring and potential reinforcement if necessary.
- Upgrade electrical system to include modern circuit breakers and replace deteriorated wiring.
- Replace corroded plumbing with new, compliant materials.
- Modernize the HVAC system for energy efficiency and compliance.
- Ensure all fire safety equipment is functional, regularly tested, and meets current standards.
- Install ramp or lift to ensure accessibility compliance.

**6. Compliance Summary**

The building generally complies with Finnish National Building Code (HLK) but falls short in several areas including electrical systems, plumbing materials, HVAC efficiency, fire safety equipment maintenance, and accessibility features. Immediate attention is advised to rectify non-compliant aspects.

**7. Conclusion**

Upon completion of the routine inspection on 12.01.2025, the industrial building at Kauppakatu 23, Toivakka, Finland, was found to be structurally sound but requires significant upgrades in various systems to meet current safety and accessibility standards as well as energy efficiency requirements.
