The electrical system shows some outdated components, specifically in the lighting fixtures and non-emergency exit lighting. Wiring appears generally in good condition but could benefit from partial modernization to meet current safety codes.

*Plumbing:*  
Plumbing installations are adequate with no leaks or significant wear noted. However, some fixtures show signs of mineral build-up indicative of hard water usage, suggesting potential maintenance for efficiency and longevity.
