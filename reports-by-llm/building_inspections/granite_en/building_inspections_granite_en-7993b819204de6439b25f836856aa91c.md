- Construction Year: 1987
- Number of Floors: Two-story structure with a basement level
- Primary Materials: Reinforced concrete frame, brick facade, and timber interior finishes

**3. Inspection Context**

- Weather Conditions on Inspection Date: Overcast with intermittent light rain; typical for late March in the Helsinki metropolitan area.
- Purpose of Inspection: Routine safety and compliance check prior to planned renovations.

**4. Observations and Findings**

*Structural:*  
The building's reinforced concrete frame shows signs of minor cracking, consistent with age and typical Finnish construction practices of the era. No immediate structural concerns were identified.

*Electrical:*  
The electrical system appears outdated, featuring fuse boxes instead of modern circuit breakers. Wiring insulation is in good condition but non-compliant with current standards. Recommend upgrading to meet safety codes.

*Plumbing:*  
Galvanized steel pipes are present throughout; some exhibit corrosion and reduced water flow. Recommend replacement with more durable materials like copper or PEX.

*HVAC:*  
The heating system, a traditional hot water radiator setup, functions but lacks modern efficiency standards. Suggest exploring upgrades to more energy-efficient systems (e.g., underfloor heating or heat pumps).

*Fire Safety:*  
Smoke detectors are installed on each floor but require battery replacement and interconnection for comprehensive coverage. Recommend a centralized fire alarm system in compliance with current Finnish safety regulations.

*Accessibility:*  
The building lacks ramp access for wheelchair users, failing to meet contemporary accessibility standards. Propose installation of ramps or elevators as part of renovation plans.

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

- Upgrade electrical system to include circuit breakers and modern wiring.
- Replace corroded plumbing with compliant materials (copper/PEX).
- Modernize HVAC for improved energy efficiency.
- Install or upgrade fire alarm system for comprehensive coverage.
- Ensure accessibility compliance through ramp installation or elevator provision.

**6. Compliance Summary**

The building partially complies with current Finnish building codes, notably falling short in electrical systems, plumbing materials, HVAC efficiency, fire safety, and accessibility. Recommended upgrades will bring the structure into alignment with modern regulations.

**7. Conclusion**

Upon inspection of Kauppakatu 23, Espoo, on 09.03.2025, by Jari P. Lehtinen, several areas requiring attention were identified. While the structural integrity remains sound for its age, significant updates are necessary to meet contemporary safety and accessibility standards. It is recommended that the community center undergoes comprehensive renovation addressing electrical, plumbing, HVAC systems, fire safety measures, and accessibility improvements.
