**Official Building Inspection Report**

**1. General Information**

- Country: Finland  
- Municipality: Hattula  
- Address: Kauppakatu 23, 37800 Hattula, Finland  
- Inspection Date: 31.08.2024  
- Inspector Name: Jari P. Lehtinen

**2. Building Overview**

- Type: Industrial  
- Construction Year: 1997  
- Number of Floors: Two (ground floor and mezzanine)  
- Primary Materials: Reinforced concrete structure with timber framing, exterior clad in weathering steel panels.

**3. Inspection Context**

- Weather Conditions: The inspection was conducted under partly cloudy skies with a temperature of 18Â°C and moderate humidity, typical for the late summer in Hattula, Finland.  
- Purpose of Inspection: Routine annual check for compliance and maintenance planning.

**4. Observations and Findings**

*Structural:*  
- The reinforced concrete structure exhibits minor cracking consistent with age and thermal movement, posing no immediate structural concern.  
- Timber framing shows signs of insect infestation (wood-boring beetles), requiring treatment to prevent further damage.

*Electrical:*  
- Electrical system appears up-to-date, compliant with current Finnish standards (FS 3101:2018).  
- Some outdated wiring was identified in less accessible areas; recommended replacement for safety and efficiency.

*Plumbing:*  
- Plumbing fixtures are generally in good condition but show signs of corrosion, particularly in older steel pipes. Recommend partial repiping to prevent future leaks.

*HVAC:*  
- Heating system (oil-fired boiler) functions adequately but lacks modern efficiency features. Suggest exploring upgrade options for energy savings.  
- Cooling system (window units) is inadequate for industrial use; propose installation of central air conditioning.

*Fire Safety:*  
- Fire alarm system is present and tested, compliant with FS 3102:2019.  
- Emergency lighting requires battery replacements as per manufacturer recommendations.

*Accessibility:*  
- Building complies with basic accessibility standards for its age but lacks features to meet current Finnish accessibility code (Laki 735/2011). Recommend improvements, especially regarding ramp access and wider doorways.

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

- Address wood-boring beetle infestation promptly through professional pest control.
- Replace outdated electrical wiring to ensure safety and efficiency.
- Perform partial repiping to mitigate corrosion risks.
- Upgrade heating system for improved energy efficiency.
- Install central air conditioning for better industrial use conditions.
- Update emergency lighting batteries in compliance with current standards.
- Enhance building accessibility features to meet modern Finnish codes.

**6. Compliance Summary**

The building generally complies with older Finnish building regulations (e.g., FS 3057:1994 for structural design) but falls short of current standards in several areas, notably fire safety and accessibility. Immediate attention to recommended improvements is advised to ensure ongoing compliance and occupant safety.

**7. Conclusion**

Upon completion of the routine inspection on 31.08.2024, by Jari P. Lehtinen, the industrial building at Kauppakatu 23, Hattula, Finland, was found to be structurally sound with minor cosmetic and systemic issues typical for its age and construction materials. While compliance with older regulations is maintained, significant updates are necessary to align with contemporary Finnish building codes and enhance safety, efficiency, and accessibility.
