**4. Observations and Findings**

*Structural:*  
The building's reinforced concrete frame exhibits minor cracking, consistent with age and typical for structures of this vintage in Finland. No immediate structural concerns were identified.

*Electrical:*  
Wiring appears to be original and shows signs of wear. Some non-compliant junction boxes were noted; recommendations for updating electrical systems to meet current standards are advised.

*Plumbing:*  
Plumbing fixtures are functional but outdated. Corrosion in galvanized steel pipes suggests potential future leaks. Recommend replacement with modern materials like PVC or copper.

*HVAC:*  
Heating system (oil-fired boiler) is operational but inefficient. Cooling system (window units) is adequate for current needs but lacks modern energy-saving features. Suggest exploring renewable heating options and upgrading cooling systems.

*Fire Safety:*  
Smoke detectors are present but may require battery replacement. Fire extinguishers are located appropriately but show signs of aging; replacement is recommended. Emergency exit signs need updating to LED for better visibility and energy efficiency.

*Accessibility:*  
The building lacks ramp access for wheelchair users, failing to meet current accessibility standards. Installation of a ramp or lift is necessary to ensure compliance with the Accessibility Act (Finland).

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

- Update electrical wiring to comply with Finnish safety regulations (Standard SS 8001).
- Replace corroded plumbing pipes to prevent future leaks and water damage.
- Upgrade HVAC systems for improved energy efficiency and compliance with environmental standards.
- Install modern, low-maintenance fire safety equipment including smoke detectors and emergency lighting.
- Ensure full accessibility by installing ramps or lifts, adhering to the Accessibility Act (621/1999).

**6. Compliance Summary**

The building generally complies with current Finnish building codes (BS 8001) but falls short in several areas related to electrical systems, plumbing, fire safety, and accessibility. Immediate attention is required for electrical and plumbing updates, while long-term planning should address HVAC efficiency and full compliance with accessibility standards.

**7. Conclusion**

Upon completion of the routine inspection on 25.06.2025, the community center in Alavieska demonstrates a mix of well-maintained structural integrity and areas requiring significant modernization to meet contemporary safety, energy efficiency, and accessibility standards. It is recommended that the municipality of Alavieska prioritize the outlined improvements to ensure the building's continued safe and inclusive use for the public.
