**1. General Information**

- Country: Finland
- Municipality: Turku
- Address: Kalevinkatu 23, 20100 Turku, Finland
- Inspection Date: 05.07.2025 (DD.MM.YYYY format)
- Inspector Name: Jari Pietil채

**2. Building Overview**

- Type: Residential
- Construction Year: 1995
- Number of Floors: Two-story building with a semi-basement
- Primary Materials: Reinforced concrete structure, timber framing, brick veneer, and asphalt shingle roofing

**3. Inspection Context**

- Weather Conditions: The inspection was conducted under partly cloudy skies with a temperature of 18째C and moderate humidity, typical for the early summer in Turku, Finland.
- Purpose of Inspection: Routine annual building safety check

**4. Observations and Findings**

*Structural:*  
The building's structural integrity appears sound with minimal signs of settlement or distress. The reinforced concrete foundation and framing show consistent wear commensurate with the age of construction.

*Electrical:*  
The electrical system is generally in good condition, though some outlets exhibit minor cosmetic damage. Wiring insulation appears intact without signs of deterioration. A few GFCI (Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter) outlets in wet areas are missing or not functioning correctly and should be replaced.

*Plumbing:*  
Plumbing fixtures are functional, though there are indications of minor leaks under sinks that require attention to prevent water damage. The hot water system shows signs of age-related efficiency loss, suggesting potential upgrades for energy conservation.

*HVAC:*  
The heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system operates adequately but could benefit from maintenance and possible component replacement to enhance efficiency and performance. The heat exchanger shows signs of corrosion, necessitating inspection by an HVAC specialist.

*Fire Safety:*  
Smoke detectors are present on each floor but require battery replacement as indicated by low battery signals. Fire extinguishers are located appropriately but one is expired and should be replaced immediately. Emergency exit signs are functional, though one sign's illumination is dim and may need bulb replacement.

*Accessibility:*  
The building complies with basic accessibility standards for residential properties of its vintage, featuring ramp access to the entrance and a ground-floor bedroom/bathroom. However, improvements could be made in bathroom grab bar installation and door threshold adjustments for wheelchair users.

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

1. Replace missing or malfunctioning GFCI outlets in wet areas.
2. Address minor leaks under sinks to prevent water damage.
3. Consider upgrading the hot water system for energy efficiency.
4. Schedule maintenance and potential component replacement for the HVAC system, focusing on the heat exchanger.
5. Replace expired fire extinguishers and check battery levels in smoke detectors.
6. Enhance bathroom accessibility with improved grab bars and adjust door thresholds.

**6. Compliance Summary**

The building generally complies with current Finnish residential construction codes, considering its 1995 construction date. However, some areas fall short of contemporary standards for electrical safety, plumbing efficiency, fire protection, and accessibility enhancements.

**7. Conclusion**

This report summarizes the findings from a routine inspection of Kalevinkatu 23 in Turku on 05.07.2025, conducted by Jari Pietil채. While the structure remains sound and compliant with historical standards, several areas require attention to meet current safety, efficiency, and accessibility benchmarks. Immediate actions are recommended for electrical, plumbing, fire safety, and minor structural improvements to ensure ongoing habitability and compliance with modern regulations.
