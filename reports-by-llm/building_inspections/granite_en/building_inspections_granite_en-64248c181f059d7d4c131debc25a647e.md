**Official Building Inspection Report**

**1. General Information**

- Country: Finland
- Municipality: Vaala
- Address: Kauppakatu 10, 37800 Vaala
- Inspection Date: 22.06.2025
- Inspector Name: Jari P. Lehtinen

**2. Building Overview**

- Type: Public (Community Center)
- Construction Year: 1983
- Number of Floors: Two-story structure with a basement level
- Primary Materials: Reinforced concrete frame, brick facade, timber interior finishings

**3. Inspection Context**

- Weather Conditions: Clear skies with temperature at 18Â°C, suitable for an indoor inspection focused on routine maintenance and minor repairs.
- Purpose of Inspection: Routine maintenance check

**4. Observations and Findings**

*Structural:*  
The building's reinforced concrete frame shows signs of minor cracking, consistent with age and typical wear for structures built in the early 1980s. The foundation appears stable without significant movement or settlement issues.

*Electrical:*  
Wiring is outdated, using aluminum conductors that are prone to oxidation and potential fire hazards. Recommend replacement with modern copper wiring.

*Plumbing:*  
Galvanized steel pipes exhibit signs of corrosion, leading to reduced water flow in some fixtures. Suggest replacing with PVC or copper piping for improved longevity and performance.

*HVAC:*  
The heating system (oil-fired boiler) is functional but inefficient. Consider upgrading to a more modern, energy-saving solution like a heat pump system.

*Fire Safety:*  
Smoke detectors are present on each floor but require battery replacement and testing. Fire extinguishers are located but some appear expired; all should be checked and replaced as necessary.

*Accessibility:*  
The building has ramp access for wheelchair users, though handrails along these ramps need repair to meet current standards.

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

- Address cracking in the reinforced concrete frame with monitoring and possible reinforcement if deemed necessary by a structural engineer.
- Replace outdated aluminum electrical wiring with copper conductors to mitigate fire risk.
- Upgrade plumbing system using corrosion-resistant materials like PVC or copper.
- Modernize the HVAC system for energy efficiency, possibly transitioning to a heat pump solution.
- Ensure all fire safety equipment (smoke detectors, extinguishers) are functional and regularly maintained.
- Repair handrails on accessibility ramps to meet current building codes.

**6. Compliance Summary**

The building generally complies with contemporary Finnish building regulations, though several areas require updates to meet current safety and efficiency standards. Specifically, electrical, plumbing, HVAC systems, and fire safety equipment need upgrading. Accessibility features, while present, need minor adjustments for full compliance.

**7. Conclusion**

The Vaala Community Center, constructed in 1983, requires targeted upgrades to ensure ongoing safety and efficiency. Immediate attention is advised for electrical, plumbing, HVAC systems, fire safety equipment, and accessibility features. Further detailed engineering assessments are recommended for structural integrity concerns.
