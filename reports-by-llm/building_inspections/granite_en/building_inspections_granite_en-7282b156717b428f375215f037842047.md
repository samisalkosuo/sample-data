**Official Building Inspection Report**

**1. General Information**

- Country: Finland
- Municipality: Huittinen
- Address: Kauppakatu 12, 48730 Huittinen, Finland
- Inspection Date: 28.02.2025
- Inspector Name: Jari P. Lehtinen

**2. Building Overview**

- Type: Industrial (Manufacturing Facility)
- Construction Year: 2009
- Number of Floors: Two-story structure with a mezzanine level, totaling three levels.
- Primary Materials: Reinforced concrete frame, steel roof trusses, and exterior cladding in fiber cement boards.

**3. Inspection Context**

- Weather Conditions: The inspection was conducted under partly cloudy skies with a temperature of -5°C and light snowfall, typical for late February in Huittinen, Finland.
- Purpose of Inspection: Routine safety and compliance check.

**4. Observations and Findings**

*Structural:*  
The building's structural integrity appears sound with no visible signs of distress or settlement. The reinforced concrete frame exhibits minor surface cracking, consistent with the age and typical behavior of such materials in Finland’s climate.

*Electrical:*  
The electrical system is generally well-maintained, though some wiring shows signs of aging. Recommend updating to modern standards for safety and efficiency.

*Plumbing:*  
Plumbing fixtures are functional but show minor leaks in a few areas. Recommend repairing these to prevent water damage and mold growth.

*HVAC:*  
Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems are operational but could benefit from an energy audit for potential efficiency improvements.

*Fire Safety:*  
Fire safety equipment is present and appears serviceable; however, the fire alarm system requires testing and possible component replacement due to age-related degradation.

*Accessibility:*  
The building has ramps and elevators compliant with current accessibility standards for individuals with disabilities.

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

1. **Structural:** Schedule a detailed structural engineering assessment to monitor cracking progression and ensure long-term stability.
2. **Electrical:** Upgrade electrical wiring to meet current Finnish safety codes (FS 34-600) for improved safety and energy efficiency.
3. **Plumbing:** Replace aging pipes and fixtures in areas noted for leaks to prevent water damage and ensure proper functioning.
4. **HVAC:** Conduct an energy audit to identify opportunities for reducing energy consumption and costs, potentially qualifying for Finnish energy efficiency grants.
5. **Fire Safety:** Test and, if necessary, replace components of the fire alarm system to ensure compliance with FS 13-201 (Finnish building code for fire safety).
6. **Accessibility:** Regularly inspect accessibility features to maintain compliance with the Accessibility Act (488/2017) and address any emerging issues promptly.

**6. Compliance Summary**

The building generally complies with current Finnish building regulations, including FS 34-600 for electrical installations and FS 13-201 for fire safety. However, some areas require updates to meet the latest standards fully.

**7. Conclusion**

This inspection reveals that while the industrial facility in Huittinen, constructed in 2009, maintains a satisfactory overall condition, several areas necessitate immediate attention to ensure ongoing safety and compliance. It is recommended that the property owner address the identified issues promptly to prevent potential hazards and optimize operational efficiency.
