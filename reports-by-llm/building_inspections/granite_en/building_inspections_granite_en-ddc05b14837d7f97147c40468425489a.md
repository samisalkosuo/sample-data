**1. General Information**

- Country: Finland  
- Municipality: Kouvola  
- Address: Pohjoisranni 23, 45100 Kouvola, Finland  
- Inspection Date: 17.06.2025  
- Inspector Name: Jari Pietiläinen  

**2. Building Overview**

- Type: Public (Community Center)  
- Construction Year: 1973  
- Number of Floors: Two-story structure  
- Primary Materials: Reinforced concrete frame with brick facade and timber interior finishings  

**3. Inspection Context**

- Weather Conditions: The inspection was conducted under partly cloudy skies with a temperature of 16°C and moderate humidity, typical for the transitional period between spring and summer in Kouvola.  
- Purpose of Inspection: Routine safety and compliance check  

**4. Observations and Findings**

*Structural:*  
- Foundation and load-bearing walls appear sound with minimal cracking, consistent with age and settlement.  
- Roof structure shows signs of minor water ingress requiring attention to flashing and sealing.  

*Electrical:*  
- Wiring is outdated; non-compliant with current safety standards. Recommend complete rewiring to meet contemporary codes.  
- Emergency lighting inadequate, needs upgrading for safety compliance.  

*Plumbing:*  
- Water supply lines show signs of corrosion, suggesting replacement to prevent leaks and potential health hazards.  
- Drainage system functional but exhibits minor root intrusion; consider professional cleaning and inspection.  

*HVAC:*  
- Heating system (likely a district heating connection) operational but efficiency could be improved with modernization of distribution.  
- Cooling system nonexistent; consideration for installation may be warranted given modern comfort standards.  

*Fire Safety:*  
- Fire alarm system absent; installation is mandatory for public buildings under current regulations.  
- Emergency exits clear but lack current signage; update in accordance with Finnish fire safety codes.  

*Accessibility:*  
- Building has ramp access but lacks elevator, posing challenges for individuals with mobility impairments. Recommendation to install an elevator or ensure all floors are accessible via ramp alone.  

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

1. Electrical system overhaul to meet current Finnish safety standards (EN 60335-1:2019).  
2. Replace corroded water supply lines to prevent future leaks and contamination risks.  
3. Upgrade emergency lighting throughout the building.  
4. Install a fire alarm system compliant with FS 1786:2019.  
5. Update emergency exit signage to current Finnish standards.  
6. Evaluate necessity and feasibility of installing an elevator for accessibility compliance (EN 1753:2019).  

**6. Compliance Summary**

The building, while structurally sound, fails to meet several contemporary Finnish building codes and safety regulations, particularly in electrical systems, plumbing, fire safety, and accessibility provisions. Immediate attention is required for non-compliant areas to ensure public safety and legal adherence.

**7. Conclusion**

Upon completion of the routine inspection on 17.06.2025, significant discrepancies were identified that necessitate urgent remedial action to bring the Kouvola Community Center into compliance with current Finnish building regulations and safety standards.
