**Official Building Inspection Report**

**1. General Information**

- Country: Finland
- Municipality: Inari
- Address: Kauppakatu 10, 99800 Saariselkä (Invented for reporting purposes)
- Inspection Date: 22.02.2025
- Inspector Name: Jorma Hietanen

**2. Building Overview**

- Type: Public (Community Center)
- Construction Year: 1984
- Number of Floors: Two-story structure with a basement level
- Primary Materials: Reinforced concrete for the main frame, timber framing for interior partitions and roof construction, exterior cladding in wooden planks treated for weather resistance.

**3. Inspection Context**

- Weather Conditions: The inspection was conducted under clear, cold conditions typical of the Finnish winter, with temperatures around -15°C and light snowfall.
- Purpose of Inspection: Routine safety and compliance check as part of the municipality's regular maintenance schedule for public buildings.

**4. Observations and Findings**

*Structural:*  
The building’s reinforced concrete frame shows minor signs of corrosion, primarily at joints and connections. The timber framing within appears sound but exhibits some moisture-related discoloration in the basement areas, suggesting past water ingress issues.

*Electrical:*  
Wiring is outdated, using older installations that do not meet current safety standards. Some circuits show signs of overheating and require immediate attention to prevent fire hazards.

*Plumbing:*  
The plumbing system includes galvanized steel pipes which are corroded in several sections, leading to reduced water flow and potential leaks. The water heater is an old model lacking modern energy-saving features.

*HVAC:*  
Heating is provided by an aging oil-fired boiler system with poor efficiency ratings. The ventilation system is basic and inadequate for current air quality standards, lacking proper filtration or humidity control mechanisms.

*Fire Safety:*  
The building has a fire alarm system installed but lacks modern smoke detectors and sprinkler systems as per contemporary regulations. Emergency exits are present but some signs are faded and unclear.

*Accessibility:*  
There is limited accessibility for individuals with disabilities, primarily due to the absence of ramps and inadequate width of doorways and corridors.

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

- **Structural:**  
  *Recommendation:* Engage a structural engineer to assess and reinforce or replace corroded components of the concrete frame and address moisture issues in timber framing.
  
- **Electrical:**  
  *Recommendation:* Upgrade electrical systems to comply with current Finnish safety standards (FS 3101:2020), including replacement of outdated wiring and installation of modern circuit breakers.

- **Plumbing:**  
  *Recommendation:* Replace corroded steel pipes with more durable materials like PEX or copper, and consider installing a modern, energy-efficient water heater.

- **HVAC:**  
  *Recommendation:* Retire the oil boiler in favor of a high-efficiency heat pump system. Upgrade ventilation to include proper filtration and humidity control.

- **Fire Safety:**  
  *Recommendation:* Install smoke detectors throughout, upgrade to an automatic sprinkler system, and improve emergency exit signage for clarity and visibility.

- **Accessibility:**  
  *Recommendation:* Implement accessibility improvements such as installing ramps, widening doorways, and ensuring all public areas are navigable for individuals with mobility impairments.

**6. Compliance Summary**

The building demonstrates significant non-compliance with current Finnish building codes (FS 3101:2020) and accessibility standards (LS 1401:2018). Major systems such as electrical, plumbing, HVAC, and fire safety fall short of required modern standards. Structural integrity, while not immediately compromised, requires professional evaluation for long-term safety assurance.

**7. Conclusion**

This inspection reveals that Kauppakatu 10 in Saariselkä, Inari, Finland, is in need of comprehensive modernization to meet current safety and accessibility standards. Immediate attention is advised for electrical, plumbing, HVAC systems, and fire safety measures. Structural assessments and accessibility modifications are recommended to ensure the building's continued safe use.
