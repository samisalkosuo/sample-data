**4. Observations and Findings**

*Structural:*  
The building's structural integrity appears sound, with reinforced concrete showing minimal signs of deterioration. Some minor cracking in the lower levels is noted but does not indicate immediate concern given the age and construction materials.

*Electrical:*  
The electrical system requires updating to meet current safety standards. Outdated wiring and insufficient outlets for modern office use are observed.

*Plumbing:*  
Plumbing fixtures are functional, though some pipes show signs of corrosion. Water pressure is adequate but could benefit from upgrading to prevent future leaks.

*HVAC:*  
Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems are present but inefficient. The heating system relies on old radiators, while the cooling capacity is insufficient for contemporary comfort standards.

*Fire Safety:*  
Fire safety measures include smoke detectors and a fire alarm system, though these require battery replacement and system testing to ensure functionality. Fire doors are present but may need adjustment for proper sealing.

*Accessibility:*  
The building lacks modern accessibility features such as ramps and elevators, which are necessary for compliance with current Finnish accessibility laws (e.g., the Accessibility Act 2016).

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

- **Electrical System:** Upgrade wiring to comply with Finnish electrical codes (FS 33120), install additional outlets, and ensure ground fault circuit interrupters (GFCIs) in wet areas.
- **Plumbing:** Replace corroded pipes, upgrade water pressure regulation system, and consider installing low-flow fixtures to conserve water.
- **HVAC:** Replace or retrofit HVAC systems to improve energy efficiency and meet contemporary comfort standards, including central air conditioning if required for office use.
- **Fire Safety:** Test fire alarm system annually, replace batteries in smoke detectors, ensure fire doors seal properly, and consider installing a sprinkler system as per Finnish building regulations (e.g., BS 5839-1).
- **Accessibility:** Install ramps at entrances, elevators to all floors, and accessible restrooms to comply with the Accessibility Act 2016.

**6. Compliance Summary**

The building demonstrates partial compliance with current Finnish building regulations and accessibility laws. While structural integrity is maintained, several critical areas including electrical systems, plumbing, HVAC, fire safety, and accessibility do not meet contemporary standards. Immediate attention to these issues is recommended for full compliance.

**7. Conclusion**

Upon completion of the routine inspection on 12.03.2025, the commercial office space at Kauppakatu 10, Lemi, Finland, was found to require significant upgrades across multiple systems to meet current safety, efficiency, and accessibility standards. Immediate action is advised to address electrical, plumbing, HVAC deficiencies, enhance fire safety measures, and ensure full compliance with the Accessibility Act 2016.
