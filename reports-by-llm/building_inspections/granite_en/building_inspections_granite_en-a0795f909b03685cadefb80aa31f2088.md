**Official Building Inspection Report**

**1. General Information**

- Country: Finland
- Municipality: Kokkola
- Address: Industrial Park Pohjanmaa, Plot 42, Kokkola
- Inspection Date: 24.05.2025 (DD.MM.YYYY format)
- Inspector Name: Jari Pietilä

**2. Building Overview**

- Type: Industrial
- Construction Year: 1976
- Number of Floors: Two-story structure
- Primary Materials: Reinforced concrete frame with brick and timber cladding

**3. Inspection Context**

Weather conditions on the inspection date were mild, with temperatures around 15°C and light rainfall typical for late spring in Kokkola. The purpose of this routine inspection was to assess the overall condition of the industrial building for compliance with current safety and structural standards.

**4. Observations and Findings**

- **Structural**: The reinforced concrete frame exhibits minor cracking, consistent with age and typical wear in Finnish construction materials of that era. No immediate collapse risk is identified.
- **Electrical**: Wiring appears outdated; non-compliant with modern safety standards. Some circuits show signs of overheating, necessitating an upgrade to meet current electrical codes.
- **Plumbing**: Galvanized steel pipes show corrosion and reduced water flow. Recommend replacement with more durable materials like PVC or copper.
- **HVAC**: The heating system (oil-fired boiler) is functional but inefficient. Suggest upgrading to a modern, energy-efficient solution such as heat pumps.
- **Fire Safety**: Fire alarm system is present but outdated; requires replacement and integration with modern fire detection technology. Smoke detectors are insufficiently distributed throughout the building.
- **Accessibility**: The building lacks ramps and has narrow doorways, failing to meet current accessibility standards for individuals with disabilities.

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

1. Structural: Schedule a detailed structural engineering assessment to monitor cracking progression and determine necessary reinforcement or repair.
2. Electrical: Replace existing wiring with modern electrical systems compliant with Finnish safety regulations (FS 34-600).
3. Plumbing: Remove and replace corroded pipes with new materials to ensure adequate water supply and prevent future leaks.
4. HVAC: Install an energy-efficient heating system, such as heat pumps, to reduce operational costs and carbon footprint.
5. Fire Safety: Upgrade fire alarm systems to include modern detection technologies and ensure proper coverage throughout the building.
6. Accessibility: Modify entrances with ramps and widen doorways to comply with Finnish accessibility laws (Laki kotimaisen kokemuksen hallinnointi- ja varaamistietyn valtioihin, 2018/577).

**6. Compliance Summary**

The building demonstrates partial compliance with current Finnish building regulations and safety standards. While the structural integrity is maintained, significant updates are required in electrical systems, plumbing, HVAC, fire safety measures, and accessibility features to ensure full compliance and tenant safety.

**7. Conclusion**

This inspection reveals that while the 1976-constructed industrial building in Kokkola's Pohjanmaa Industrial Park retains its basic structural soundness, extensive modernization is necessary to meet contemporary standards and regulations. Immediate attention should be given to electrical, plumbing, HVAC systems, fire safety improvements, and accessibility modifications.
