**4. Observations and Findings**

*Structural:*  
The building's structural integrity appears sound with no visible signs of distress or settlement. The reinforced concrete frame meets contemporary standards for industrial use in Finland.

*Electrical:*  
The electrical system is generally well-maintained, though some wiring shows minor degradation, suggesting potential future attention to ensure safety and efficiency.

*Plumbing:*  
Plumbing fixtures are functional but show signs of corrosion, particularly in older sections installed around the time of construction.

*HVAC:*  
Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems are operational but could benefit from an upgrade to improve energy efficiency, aligning with modern standards.

*Fire Safety:*  
Fire safety measures, including fire alarms and extinguishers, are present and appear serviceable. However, the sprinkler system is outdated and requires replacement or modernization.

*Accessibility:*  
The building has adequate access for persons with disabilities, complying with Finnish accessibility laws of 2008, though some areas could benefit from minor adjustments to meet current best practices.

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

- **Electrical:** Replace outdated wiring to prevent potential hazards and improve energy efficiency.
- **Plumbing:** Inspect and replace corroded sections of plumbing to avoid leaks and water damage.
- **HVAC:** Upgrade HVAC systems to meet current energy standards, reducing operational costs and environmental impact.
- **Fire Safety:** Install a modern sprinkler system in compliance with Finnish safety regulations (EN 166).
- **Accessibility:** Review accessibility features, particularly in high-traffic areas, ensuring they align with the latest guidelines (FS 1305).

**6. Compliance Summary**

However, several areas fall short of current standards or best practices, particularly concerning electrical systems, plumbing, HVAC, and accessibility features.

**7. Conclusion**

The industrial facility at Kauppakatu 23 demonstrates satisfactory structural condition but requires attention to various systems to ensure ongoing safety, efficiency, and compliance with modern regulations. It is recommended that the owner address the identified issues promptly to maintain a safe and functional workspace.
