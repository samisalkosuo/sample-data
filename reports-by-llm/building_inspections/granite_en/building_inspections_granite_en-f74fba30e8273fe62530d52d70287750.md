**Official Building Inspection Report**

**1. General Information**

- Country: Finland
- Municipality: Eura
- Address: Kauppakatu 23, 02510 Eura, Finland
- Inspection Date: 19.08.2024
- Inspector Name: Jari P. Lehtinen

**2. Building Overview**

- Type: Residential (Single-family detached house)
- Construction Year: 1978
- Number of Floors: Two, including a basement level
- Primary Materials: Reinforced concrete frame with timber framing and wooden cladding typical for Finnish construction in the late 20th century.

**3. Inspection Context**

- Weather Conditions: The inspection was conducted under partly cloudy skies with a temperature of 18Â°C and moderate humidity, common for Eura's August climate.
- Purpose of Inspection: Routine annual check as per local municipal regulations.

**4. Observations and Findings**

*Structural:*  
The building frame shows signs of minor settling, consistent with its age and construction materials. No immediate structural concerns were identified.

*Electrical:*  
Wiring appears to be original and in need of updating. Some outlets lack ground-fault circuit interrupters (GFCIs), particularly in bathrooms and kitchen areas, which is a safety concern.

*Plumbing:*  
Plumbing system functions adequately but exhibits signs of corrosion in older metal pipes, suggesting potential future leaks or reduced water pressure.

*HVAC:*  
The heating system (oil-fired boiler) is functional but outdated and inefficient. Cooling is nonexistent; given modern standards, consideration should be made for improved thermal comfort.

*Fire Safety:*  
Smoke detectors are present on each floor but require battery replacement. There is a lack of sprinkler systems, which would enhance fire safety in line with contemporary standards.

*Accessibility:*  
The property has no significant accessibility barriers for typical residential use; however, improvements could be made to ensure compliance with modern accessibility codes if modifications are planned.

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

- **Electrical:** Upgrade wiring to meet current safety standards, install GFCIs in all required areas, and consider a subpanel for better load management.
- **Plumbing:** Replace corroded metal pipes to prevent future leaks; evaluate the feasibility of a whole-house water filtration system.
- **HVAC:** Recommend replacing the oil-fired boiler with a more efficient heating solution, such as a heat pump, and explore options for cooling installation.
- **Fire Safety:** Replace smoke detector batteries immediately and consider installing an interconnected smoke alarm system. Evaluate the necessity of retrofitting a sprinkler system.
- **Accessibility:** Conduct a detailed accessibility audit if renovations or modifications are planned to ensure compliance with current standards.

**6. Compliance Summary**

The property generally complies with building codes as they stood in 1978, but several areas fall short of current Finnish regulations and best practices. Specifically, electrical, plumbing, HVAC systems, fire safety measures, and potential accessibility improvements require attention to meet today's standards.

**7. Conclusion**

The residential property at Kauppakatu 23, Eura, demonstrates a solid structural foundation but requires updates across various systems to align with contemporary Finnish building codes and enhance safety, efficiency, and accessibility. It is recommended that the owner schedule necessary upgrades, particularly in electrical, plumbing, HVAC, fire safety, and consider accessibility improvements to ensure the property's long-term compliance and resident well-being.
