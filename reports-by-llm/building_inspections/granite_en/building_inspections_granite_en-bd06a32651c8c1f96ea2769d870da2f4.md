**Official Building Inspection Report**

**1. General Information**

- Country: Finland
- Municipality: Lemland
- Address: Kauppakatu 23, 28100 Lemland
- Inspection Date: 17.05.2025 (DD.MM.YYYY format)
- Inspector Name: Jari Pietilä

**2. Building Overview**

- Type: Residential
- Construction Year: 1987
- Number of Floors: Two-story building with a pitched roof
- Primary Materials: Reinforced concrete frame, timber framing for walls, and a standing seam metal roof common in Finnish construction during the late 20th century.

**3. Inspection Context**

- Weather Conditions: The inspection was conducted under partly cloudy skies with a temperature of 14°C and moderate winds, typical for the Lemland region in mid-May.
- Purpose of Inspection: Routine annual building safety check.

**4. Observations and Findings**

*Structural:*  
The building's foundation appears sound with no visible cracking or settlement issues. The structural framing shows minor signs of rust on exposed steel elements, consistent with age and exposure to Finland’s climate.

*Electrical:*  
Wiring is present but outdated; non-metallic sheathed cable (NM-cable) is used throughout. Some junction boxes are overloaded, posing a fire hazard. Recommend upgrading to modern wiring standards.

*Plumbing:*  
Plumbing system includes galvanized steel pipes which exhibit signs of corrosion and reduced water flow. Recommend replacement with more durable materials like copper or PEX.

*HVAC:*  
The heating system, a gas-fired boiler with radiators, functions but lacks modern efficiency features. Insulation levels are inadequate for contemporary energy standards. Suggest upgrading to a high-efficiency condensing boiler and improving insulation.

*Fire Safety:*  
Smoke detectors are present on each floor but require battery replacement. Fire extinguishers are located but some are expired; all should be checked and replaced as necessary.

*Accessibility:*  
The building has a single-level entry with no apparent barriers for typical mobility. However, interior doorways are narrow, potentially posing challenges for wheelchair users or those with mobility aids. Recommend widening doorways to meet current accessibility standards.

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

1. **Electrical:** Upgrade wiring to comply with current Finnish electrical codes (FS 3201:2018).
2. **Plumbing:** Replace corroded galvanized steel pipes with modern alternatives like copper or PEX.
3. **HVAC:** Install a high-efficiency condensing boiler and enhance insulation to meet Finnish energy efficiency standards (FS 5100:2019).
4. **Fire Safety:** Replace expired fire extinguishers, test all smoke detectors, and ensure they are interconnected for optimal safety.
5. **Accessibility:** Widen interior doorways to comply with the Accessibility Act (627/1999) in Finland.

**6. Compliance Summary**

The building generally adheres to structural integrity requirements but falls short on several key areas including electrical, plumbing, HVAC efficiency, fire safety equipment maintenance, and accessibility standards. While the core structure is sound for its age, significant upgrades are recommended to ensure compliance with current Finnish building codes and enhance safety and comfort.

**7. Conclusion**

This residential property in Lemland demonstrates a solid structural foundation but requires comprehensive modernization across various systems to meet contemporary standards of safety, energy efficiency, and accessibility. Immediate attention is advised for electrical, plumbing, HVAC upgrades, fire safety equipment maintenance, and accessibility improvements.
