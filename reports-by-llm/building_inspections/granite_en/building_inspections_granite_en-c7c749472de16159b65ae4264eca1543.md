**Official Building Inspection Report**

**1. General Information**

- Country: Finland
- Municipality: Muonio
- Address: Kauppakatu 23, 94800 Kittila (Note: This is a fictional address for the purpose of this report)
- Inspection Date: 20.03.2025
- Inspector Name: Jari Pekka Hietanen

**2. Building Overview**

- Type: Public (Community Center)
- Construction Year: 1989
- Number of Floors: Two-story structure with a basement level
- Primary Materials: Reinforced concrete for the main frame, timber framing for interior partitions and roof construction, exterior cladding in wood fiber boards (Finnframing)

**3. Inspection Context**

- Weather Conditions: The inspection was conducted under partly cloudy skies with a temperature of -5Â°C and light snowfall, typical for the Muonio region during late March.
- Purpose of Inspection: Routine annual compliance check

**4. Observations and Findings**

*Structural:*  
The building's structural integrity appears sound, with no visible signs of distress or settlement. The reinforced concrete frame exhibits minor surface cracking, consistent with age and climatic conditions.

*Electrical:*  
The electrical system shows some outdated components, including non-grounded outlets and wiring that does not meet current safety standards. There are signs of moisture intrusion in the basement electrical panel, necessitating immediate attention to prevent hazards.

*Plumbing:*  
Plumbing fixtures are generally functional but show signs of corrosion, particularly in older galvanized steel pipes. Water pressure is adequate, though some faucets exhibit reduced flow due to mineral buildup.

*HVAC:*  
The heating system (oil-fired boiler) operates efficiently but lacks modern energy-saving features. The ventilation system shows signs of inadequate air exchange, potentially leading to poor indoor air quality.

*Fire Safety:*  
Smoke detectors are present on each floor but require battery replacement and interconnection for comprehensive coverage. Fire extinguishers are located but some appear expired and need immediate attention. Emergency exits are clearly marked but one exit is partially obstructed by stored materials.

*Accessibility:*  
The building has ramp access for wheelchair users, though the gradient exceeds recommended specifications for ease of use. Handrails on stairs are present but incomplete on one section.

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

- Upgrade electrical system to meet current safety standards, including grounding and replacement of outdated wiring.
- Address moisture issues in the basement electrical panel to prevent hazards.
- Replace corroded plumbing components and consider upgrading to more durable materials like PEX or copper.
- Improve HVAC efficiency by installing programmable thermostats and enhancing ventilation systems for better air quality.
- Replace expired fire safety equipment and ensure all smoke detectors are interconnected. Clear obstructions from emergency exits.
- Adjust ramp gradients to comply with accessibility standards and complete handrail installations on stair sections.

**6. Compliance Summary**

The building generally adheres to structural requirements but falls short in several critical areas related to electrical, plumbing, fire safety, and accessibility compliance. Immediate attention is required for identified hazards and non-compliant features to ensure public safety and legal adherence.

**7. Conclusion**

This inspection reveals that while the 1989 community center in Muonio retains structural soundness, numerous areas require urgent modernization to meet current building codes and safety standards. It is recommended that the municipality of Muonio prioritize repairs and upgrades, particularly concerning electrical systems, plumbing, fire safety measures, and accessibility improvements.
