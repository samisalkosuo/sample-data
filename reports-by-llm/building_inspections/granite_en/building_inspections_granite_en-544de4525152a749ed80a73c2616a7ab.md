**2. Building Overview**

- Type: Industrial  
- Construction Year: 2008  
- Number of Floors: Two (ground floor and mezzanine level)  
- Primary Materials: Reinforced concrete structure with a metal cladding facade, typical for industrial buildings in Finland during that era.

**3. Inspection Context**

- Weather Conditions: The inspection was conducted under partly cloudy skies with a temperature of 18°C and moderate humidity, common for the late summer season in Siikalatva.  
- Purpose of Inspection: Routine safety and compliance check.

**4. Observations and Findings**

*Structural:*  
- The reinforced concrete structure showed minor signs of cracking, consistent with natural aging and typical for buildings of this age in Finland's climate. No immediate structural concerns were identified.

*Electrical:*  
- Electrical systems appeared to be in good condition, compliant with current standards. However, some older components suggested a potential need for upgrades to meet modern efficiency criteria.

*Plumbing:*  
- Plumbing fixtures and pipes were generally sound but showed minor corrosion indications, particularly around joints. Recommendation for inspection and possible replacement of vulnerable sections.

*HVAC:*  
- Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems functioned adequately. However, the age of the units recommended considering modern energy-efficient alternatives to reduce operational costs.

*Fire Safety:*  
- Fire safety measures including smoke detectors and fire alarms were present and functional. Recommendation for periodic testing and maintenance of these systems.

*Accessibility:*  
- The building complied with basic accessibility standards, though improvements could be made to enhance full compliance with current regulations, particularly regarding ramp inclines and doorway widths.

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

1. Address minor cracking in the reinforced concrete structure through monitoring and potential reinforcement if expansion continues.
2. Upgrade electrical components to improve energy efficiency and ensure compliance with contemporary standards.
3. Inspect and replace corroded plumbing sections to prevent leaks and water damage.
4. Evaluate modern HVAC systems for potential installation to reduce operational costs and enhance performance.
5. Conduct thorough testing of fire safety equipment and update maintenance schedules.
6. Review accessibility features to ensure full compliance with current Finnish building codes, focusing on ramp improvements and doorway dimensions.

**6. Compliance Summary**

The building generally complies with the 2024 revision of Finnish industrial building regulations. However, several areas require attention to meet ongoing standards, particularly concerning energy efficiency, plumbing integrity, and accessibility enhancements.

**7. Conclusion**

Upon completion of this routine inspection on 25.08.2024, the industrial building at Kauppakatu 23, Siikalatva, Finland, was found to be structurally sound with minor aging-related issues. While compliance is maintained, proactive measures are recommended to address identified areas for improvement.
