**Official Building Inspection Report**

**1. General Information**

- Country: Finland  
- Municipality: Joutsa  
- Address: Kauppakatu 23, 37400 Joutsa, Finland  
- Inspection Date: 03.01.2025 (DD.MM.YYYY format)  
- Inspector Name: Marko Pietilä

**2. Building Overview**

- Type: Industrial  
- Construction Year: 2004  
- Number of Floors: Two-story structure with a mezzanine level  
- Primary Materials: Reinforced concrete frame, timber framing for interior partitions, metal cladding exterior, and asphalt shingle roofing  

**3. Inspection Context**

- Weather Conditions: The inspection was conducted under clear, cold conditions typical of a Finnish January, with temperatures around -10°C and light snowfall present on the ground.  
- Purpose of Inspection: Routine annual compliance check  

**4. Observations and Findings**

*Structural:*  
- Foundation: Generally sound, with minor cracking observed in some areas, consistent with settling over time.  
- Load-bearing elements: Reinforced concrete beams and columns appear adequate for the building's design load.  
- Roof structure: Metal cladding and asphalt shingle roof show signs of wear but are structurally intact.  

*Electrical:*  
- Wiring: Mostly up to code, though some older sections near the main service panel exhibit deterioration and require replacement for safety.  
- Lighting fixtures: Several outdated fixtures identified; recommendations for energy-efficient LED upgrades.  

*Plumbing:*  
- Water supply lines: Galvanized steel pipes show signs of corrosion, suggesting potential future leaks; partial repiping with PEX is recommended.  
- Drainage system: Functional but with some minor root intrusion in older sections, requiring cleaning and inspection.  

*HVAC:*  
- Heating system: Older gas-fired boiler operational but nearing end of life; suggest evaluation for modern, high-efficiency replacement.  
- Ventilation: Adequate but could benefit from improved air filtration systems to meet current environmental standards.  

*Fire Safety:*  
- Fire alarm system: Functional but outdated components identified; recommend full system upgrade in compliance with current regulations.  
- Fire extinguishers: Some expired, requiring immediate replacement.  

*Accessibility:*  
- Building entrances and pathways comply with accessibility standards for individuals with disabilities. However, interior modifications may be necessary to fully meet modern requirements.  

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

1. Address foundation cracking with sealant and monitoring.
2. Replace outdated electrical wiring near the main service panel.
3. Upgrade lighting fixtures to energy-efficient LEDs throughout.
4. Schedule partial repiping of water supply lines using PEX material.
5. Clean and inspect drainage system for root intrusion and blockages.
6. Evaluate heating system for replacement with a modern, high-efficiency boiler.
7. Upgrade fire alarm system to meet current regulatory standards.
8. Replace expired fire extinguishers immediately.
9. Consider interior modifications to enhance accessibility fully.

**6. Compliance Summary**

The building generally complies with Finnish building codes, notably in structural integrity and basic safety measures. However, several areas require attention to meet current standards and regulations, particularly concerning electrical systems, plumbing, HVAC, fire safety, and energy efficiency.

**7. Conclusion**

This report summarizes the findings of a routine inspection conducted on 03.01.2025 at Kauppakatu 23 in Joutsa, Finland. While the industrial building from 2004 demonstrates overall structural soundness, numerous areas necessitate updates to ensure compliance and safety. Immediate actions are recommended for electrical, plumbing, fire safety systems, and consideration of energy-efficient upgrades. Further detailed engineering assessments may be required for specific recommendations.
