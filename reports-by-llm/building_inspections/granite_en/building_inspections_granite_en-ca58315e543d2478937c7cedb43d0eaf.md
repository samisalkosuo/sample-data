**Official Building Inspection Report**

**1. General Information**

- Country: Finland
- Municipality: Hammarland
- Address: Kauppakatu 23, 40100 Hammarland, Finland
- Inspection Date: 05.01.2025 (DD.MM.YYYY)
- Inspector Name: Jari Pietilä

**2. Building Overview**

- Type: Industrial
- Construction Year: 2018
- Number of Floors: Two-story structure with a mezzanine level, totaling three levels.
- Primary Materials: Reinforced concrete frame, timber framing for interior partitions, and exterior cladding in Finnish white spruce siding with asphalt roof tiles.

**3. Inspection Context**

- Weather Conditions: The inspection was conducted under partly cloudy skies with a temperature of -5°C and light snowfall, typical for early January in Hammarland, Finland.
- Purpose of Inspection: Routine safety and compliance check.

**4. Observations and Findings**

*Structural:*  
The building's structural integrity appears sound with no visible signs of distress or settlement. The reinforced concrete frame meets contemporary standards for industrial buildings in Finland.

*Electrical:*  
The electrical system is generally compliant, though minor discrepancies were noted regarding ground fault circuit interrupters (GFCIs) in wet areas, which are required by current Finnish electrical codes.

*Plumbing:*  
Plumbing fixtures and piping show no immediate leaks or issues. However, the water heating system's insulation could be improved to meet energy efficiency standards set forth by Finnish building regulations.

*HVAC:*  
The heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system operates efficiently. Regular maintenance records were found, indicating compliance with Finnish environmental and energy-saving guidelines.

*Fire Safety:*  
Smoke detectors and fire alarms are present and functional. The fire suppression system is adequate for the building's size and use but requires biannual testing as per Finnish safety codes, which was overdue.

*Accessibility:*  
The building has ramp access and elevator service to all floors, meeting Finnish accessibility standards for industrial buildings constructed post-2015.

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

- **GFCI Installation:** Install GFCIs in all wet areas as required by current electrical codes.
- **Water Heating Insulation:** Improve insulation on water heating systems to enhance energy efficiency.
- **Fire Suppression Testing:** Schedule and conduct fire suppression system testing within the next 60 days to ensure ongoing compliance.

**6. Compliance Summary**

The building largely complies with Finnish industrial building codes, notably in structural integrity, plumbing, HVAC efficiency, and accessibility features. However, there are minor deviations concerning electrical safety (GFCI installation) and fire suppression system maintenance, necessitating corrective actions to fully meet current regulatory standards.

**7. Conclusion**

Upon completion of the recommended corrective actions, the building will be in full compliance with Finnish industrial construction codes. It is advised that the property owner/manager address the noted issues promptly to ensure ongoing safety and efficiency.
