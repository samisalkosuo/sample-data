**Official Building Inspection Report**

**1. General Information**

- Country: Finland  
- Municipality: Parikkala  
- Address: Kauppakatu 12, 47100 Parikkala, Finland  
- Inspection Date: 18.06.2025  
- Inspector Name: Jari Pietilä

**2. Building Overview**

- Type: Industrial  
- Construction Year: 1972  
- Number of Floors: Two-story structure  
- Primary Materials: Reinforced concrete and brick façade with timber framing

**3. Inspection Context**

Weather conditions on the inspection date were partly cloudy with a temperature range of 14°C to 20°C, typical for early summer in Parikkala. The purpose of this routine inspection was to assess the structural integrity and compliance with current building safety standards prior to potential renovation activities.

**4. Observations and Findings**

- **Structural**: The reinforced concrete frame shows signs of minor cracking, consistent with age-related settlement. No immediate concerns for load-bearing capacity were identified.
- **Electrical**: Wiring appears outdated; non-compliant with current safety standards. Some circuits show overheating potential due to insufficient amperage.
- **Plumbing**: Galvanized steel pipes exhibit signs of corrosion, leading to reduced water flow in several fixtures. Recommend replacement for improved efficiency and compliance.
- **HVAC**: The heating system (oil-fired boiler) is functional but lacks modern energy-saving features. Consider upgrading to a more efficient system.
- **Fire Safety**: Fire alarm system is present but outdated, requiring immediate attention for reliability. Smoke detectors are insufficient in coverage and need updating.
- **Accessibility**: The building does not meet current accessibility standards, particularly regarding ramp construction and doorway widths for wheelchair access.

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

1. Address minor cracks in the reinforced concrete frame with epoxy injections to prevent further deterioration.
2. Upgrade electrical wiring to meet current safety standards, ensuring adequate circuit protection and amperage.
3. Replace corroded galvanized steel plumbing with modern materials like PEX or copper for improved water quality and flow.
4. Install an energy-efficient HVAC system, such as a heat pump, to reduce operational costs and environmental impact.
5. Update the fire alarm system components and extend smoke detector coverage in accordance with Finnish safety regulations (FS 3801).
6. Modify building entrances and interior pathways to ensure compliance with accessibility standards (e.g., installing ramps, widening doorways).

**6. Compliance Summary**

The building demonstrates partial compliance with current Finnish building codes (FS 3801), particularly concerning electrical systems, plumbing, fire safety, and accessibility. Immediate attention to the identified issues is recommended to ensure full compliance and occupant safety.

**7. Conclusion**

This inspection reveals that while the industrial building in Parikkala retains structural integrity, several critical areas require modernization to meet contemporary standards of safety, efficiency, and accessibility. It is advised to address these issues promptly to ensure the building's continued usability and compliance with Finnish regulations.
