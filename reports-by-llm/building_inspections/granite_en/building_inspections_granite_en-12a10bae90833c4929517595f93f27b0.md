**Official Building Inspection Report**

**1. General Information**

- Country: Finland
- Municipality: Alajärvi
- Address: Kauppakatu 23, 80100 Alajärvi, Finland
- Inspection Date: 05.05.2025 (DD.MM.YYYY format)
- Inspector Name: Jari Pekkarinen

**2. Building Overview**

- Type: Industrial
- Construction Year: 1990
- Number of Floors: Two-story structure with a mezzanine level, typical for industrial use in the early 1990s.
- Primary Materials: Reinforced concrete frame with timber flooring and metal cladding on exterior walls, common for Finnish industrial buildings of this vintage.

**3. Inspection Context**

- Weather Conditions: The inspection was conducted under partly cloudy skies with a temperature of 12°C and moderate winds, typical for the transition period between spring and summer in Alajärvi.
- Purpose of Inspection: Routine safety and compliance check as per local municipal regulations.

**4. Observations and Findings**

*Structural:*  
The building's structural integrity appears sound with minimal signs of settlement or distress. The reinforced concrete frame exhibits standard wear consistent with its age, no immediate concerns identified.

*Electrical:*  
The electrical system shows some outdated components, including non-grounded outlets and older wiring. These elements require upgrading to meet current safety standards.

*Plumbing:*  
Plumbing fixtures are generally functional but show signs of corrosion, particularly in older galvanized steel pipes. Recommend replacement with modern materials to prevent future leaks or contamination.

*HVAC:*  
Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems are present but outdated. The boiler is operational though lacks modern efficiency features. Suggest upgrading to energy-efficient models for cost savings and environmental compliance.

*Fire Safety:*  
Smoke detectors are installed but may not meet current density requirements for industrial spaces. Additional detectors might be necessary, especially on the mezzanine level. Fire extinguishers are present but some appear expired; replacement is advised.

*Accessibility:*  
The building lacks ramp access for individuals with mobility impairments as per current Finnish accessibility standards (e.g., Act on the Promotion of Equal Rights for People with Disabilities). Installation of ramps or lifts is recommended to ensure compliance.

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

- Upgrade electrical system to include grounded outlets and modern wiring.
- Replace corroded plumbing pipes with contemporary materials (e.g., PEX, copper).
- Modernize HVAC systems for energy efficiency; consider heat pump solutions.
- Increase the number of smoke detectors to meet current safety standards.
- Replace expired fire extinguishers and ensure regular maintenance checks.
- Install ramps or elevators to comply with accessibility regulations.

**6. Compliance Summary**

The building generally adheres to Finnish industrial construction codes from the early 1990s but falls short in several areas due to outdated systems and lack of recent upgrades. While structural integrity is maintained, non-compliance with current electrical, plumbing, HVAC, fire safety, and accessibility standards necessitates remedial action to ensure safety and legal adherence.

**7. Conclusion**

Upon completion of the inspection on 05.05.2025, several areas require attention to meet present-day Finnish building regulations and safety standards. Immediate recommendations are outlined to address electrical, plumbing, HVAC system deficiencies, fire safety concerns, and accessibility issues. Failure to implement these changes may result in non-compliance penalties and pose risks to occupant safety.
