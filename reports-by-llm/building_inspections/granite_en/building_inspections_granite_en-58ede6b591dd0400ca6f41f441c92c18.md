**4. Observations and Findings**

*Structural:*  
The building's structural integrity appears sound with minimal signs of settlement or distress. The reinforced concrete frame exhibits standard wear consistent with its age.

*Electrical:*  
The electrical system shows some outdated components, including non-grounded outlets and wiring that does not meet current safety standards. There are also insufficient data points for modern technology integration.

*Plumbing:*  
Plumbing fixtures are generally functional but show signs of corrosion in older pipes, particularly in the basement level. Water pressure is adequate, though some faucets exhibit dripping due to worn-out washers.

*HVAC:*  
The heating system (district heating connection) is operational but less efficient than newer models. The air conditioning unit, if present, was not functional and requires replacement or repair.

*Fire Safety:*  
Smoke detectors are installed on each floor but require battery replacement. Fire extinguishers are present but some appear expired. Emergency lighting is functional but could benefit from an upgrade to LED technology for energy efficiency.

*Accessibility:*  
The building has ramp access but lacks elevator facilities, posing challenges for individuals with mobility impairments. Handrails on stairs are present but in need of repair in some sections.

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

- **Electrical:** Upgrade electrical system to meet current standards, including ground fault circuit interrupters (GFCIs) and additional data outlets.
- **Plumbing:** Replace corroded pipes in the basement to prevent leaks and water damage.
- **HVAC:** Install a modern, energy-efficient heating solution and ensure proper functioning of any air conditioning units.
- **Fire Safety:** Replace expired fire extinguishers, check and replace batteries in smoke detectors, and consider upgrading emergency lighting to LED systems.
- **Accessibility:** Install an elevator to comply with accessibility standards or provide clear signage indicating the building's non-elevator status for visitor information.

**6. Compliance Summary**

The building generally complies with Finnish building codes, particularly concerning structural integrity and fire safety measures. However, several areas fall short of current regulations, notably in electrical systems, plumbing, HVAC efficiency, and accessibility provisions. Immediate attention to these issues is recommended for full compliance.

**7. Conclusion**

Upon completion of the routine inspection on 26.02.2025, the community center in Pori exhibits satisfactory structural condition but requires updates across various systems to meet contemporary safety and accessibility standards. It is recommended that the municipality address the noted deficiencies promptly to ensure public safety and compliance with Finnish building regulations.
