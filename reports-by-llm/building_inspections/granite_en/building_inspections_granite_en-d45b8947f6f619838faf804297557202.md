**Official Building Inspection Report**

**1. General Information**

- Country: Finland  
- Municipality: Pukkila  
- Address: Kauppakatu 23, 02610 Pukkila, Finland  
- Inspection Date: 23.02.2025  
- Inspector Name: Jari P. Lehtinen

**2. Building Overview**

- Type: Industrial  
- Construction Year: 1989  
- Number of Floors: Two (ground floor and mezzanine level)  
- Primary Materials: Reinforced concrete structure with timber framing, exterior clad in weathering steel panels.

**3. Inspection Context**

- Weather Conditions: The inspection was conducted under partly cloudy skies with a temperature of -5Â°C and light snowfall, typical for early February in Pukkila, Finland.  
- Purpose of Inspection: Routine safety and compliance check.

**4. Observations and Findings**

*Structural:*  
The building's reinforced concrete structure appears sound with minimal signs of cracking, consistent with its age and construction materials. The timber framing shows some minor decay, which is being monitored.

*Electrical:*  
The electrical system is outdated but functional. Wiring insulation is in good condition, though the panelboard requires upgrading to meet current safety standards due to limited space for expansion.

*Plumbing:*  
Plumbing fixtures are generally in fair condition, with some corrosion noted on older steel pipes. Water pressure is adequate, but there are signs of minor leaks requiring attention.

*HVAC:*  
The heating system, comprising an old oil-fired boiler and radiator network, functions but lacks modern efficiency standards. Recommendation for transition to a more energy-efficient solution is advised.

*Fire Safety:*  
Smoke detectors are present on each floor but require battery replacement and interconnection for comprehensive coverage. Fire extinguishers are adequately placed but some are expired, necessitating immediate replacement.

*Accessibility:*  
The building has limited accessibility features, with no ramps or elevators present. This poses challenges for individuals with mobility impairments and does not comply with current Finnish accessibility regulations.

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

- Replace expired fire extinguishers and ensure all detectors are interconnected and battery-tested regularly.
- Upgrade electrical panelboard to accommodate modern electrical loads and safety standards.
- Address minor leaks in plumbing and replace corroded sections of pipework.
- Transition the HVAC system to a more energy-efficient model, considering modern technologies like heat pumps.
- Install ramps and consider an elevator to meet accessibility requirements under Finnish Building Code (Tiedonantaminenlaki).

**6. Compliance Summary**

The building generally complies with structural integrity and basic safety standards for its age. However, several areas fall short of current Finnish building codes, particularly in electrical systems, fire safety equipment, plumbing, HVAC efficiency, and accessibility features. Immediate attention to these issues is recommended to ensure ongoing compliance and occupant safety.

**7. Conclusion**

Upon completion of the routine inspection on 23.02.2025, by Inspector Jari P. Lehtinen, it is noted that while the industrial building at Kauppakatu 23 demonstrates structural soundness, numerous areas require updating to meet contemporary standards and regulations. Immediate action is advised for electrical upgrades, fire safety improvements, plumbing repairs, HVAC modernization, and accessibility enhancements to ensure the property's continued safe and legal operation.
