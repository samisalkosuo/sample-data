**4. Observations and Findings**

*Structural:*  
The building's structural integrity appears sound with minimal signs of settlement or distress. The reinforced concrete frame exhibits standard wear consistent with its age, and no immediate concerns were noted.

*Electrical:*  
The electrical system shows some outdated components, including non-grounded outlets and older wiring. These elements require upgrading to meet current safety standards.

*Plumbing:*  
Plumbing fixtures are generally functional but show signs of corrosion in older pipes, particularly in the basement area. Recommend replacement of affected sections to prevent leaks or water damage.

*HVAC:*  
The heating system (district heating connection) is operational but less efficient than modern systems. Insulation levels around pipes and within walls could be improved for better energy conservation.

*Fire Safety:*  
Smoke detectors are present on each floor, but some batteries are low and need replacement. Fire extinguishers are adequately located but should be inspected and serviced according to current regulations.

*Accessibility:*  
The building has ramp access for wheelchair users, though door thresholds require adjustment to meet current accessibility standards.

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

- Upgrade electrical system components to ensure grounding and compliance with modern safety codes.
- Replace corroded sections of plumbing in the basement to prevent future leaks.
- Improve insulation around HVAC pipes and within walls for enhanced energy efficiency.
- Service and replace smoke detector batteries, ensuring all detectors are fully functional.
- Adjust door thresholds to meet accessibility standards.

**6. Compliance Summary**

The building generally complies with current Finnish building codes, notwithstanding some areas requiring updates to align with contemporary safety and accessibility standards. Specifically, electrical, plumbing, fire safety, and accessibility aspects need attention to ensure full compliance.

**7. Conclusion**

Upon completion of the routine inspection on 13.04.2025, the community center in Sauvo demonstrates satisfactory structural integrity but requires updates to electrical systems, plumbing, fire safety equipment, and accessibility features. It is recommended that these issues be addressed promptly to maintain a safe and compliant environment for public use.
