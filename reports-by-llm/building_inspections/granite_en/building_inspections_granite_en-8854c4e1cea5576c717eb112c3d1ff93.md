**Official Building Inspection Report**

**1. General Information**

- **Country**: Finland
- **Municipality**: Juva
- **Address**: Kauppakatu 10, 32510 Juva (Invented for reporting purposes)
- **Inspection Date**: 14.03.2025 (DD.MM.YYYY format)
- **Inspector Name**: Marko Pietilä

**2. Building Overview**

- **Type**: Industrial
- **Construction Year**: 1993
- **Number of Floors**: Two-story structure, typical for industrial buildings from that era in Finland.
- **Primary Materials**: Reinforced concrete and steel framework with a brick facade, common in Finnish construction during the early 1990s.

**3. Inspection Context**

- **Weather Conditions**: On the inspection date, the weather was overcast with light rain, typical for late March in Juva, Finland. Temperature was around 5°C (41°F).
- **Purpose of Inspection**: Routine safety and compliance check as part of regular industrial facility maintenance schedules.

**4. Observations and Findings**

- **Structural Integrity**: The building's structural elements showed minor signs of corrosion on steel components, consistent with age and exposure to Finland’s harsh winter conditions. No immediate structural concerns were identified.
- **Electrical Systems**: Wiring appeared aged but functional. Some non-compliant outlets were noted; recommendations for updating to meet current safety standards are advised.
- **Plumbing**: Water supply lines and drainage systems were in reasonable condition, though minor leaks were detected requiring attention.
- **HVAC**: Heating system functioned adequately but showed signs of inefficiency. Recommendation is to assess modernization options for energy savings.
- **Fire Safety**: Fire alarm system was present and tested, compliant with basic standards. However, fire extinguishers were outdated; replacement is recommended.
- **Accessibility**: The building lacked ramp access for individuals with mobility impairments as per current Finnish accessibility laws. Modifications are necessary to ensure compliance.

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

1. **Corrosion on Steel Framework**: Schedule a detailed inspection by a specialist to assess the extent of corrosion and plan for protective coating or replacement where necessary.
2. **Outdated Electrical Outlets**: Replace all non-compliant outlets with modern, grounded alternatives that meet current Finnish electrical codes (FS 3101).
3. **Plumbing Leaks**: Repair minor leaks in water supply and drainage systems to prevent further damage and water wastage.
4. **HVAC Inefficiency**: Conduct an energy audit to evaluate modernization options, possibly including high-efficiency heating solutions compliant with Finnish energy regulations.
5. **Fire Safety Upgrades**: Replace outdated fire extinguishers with new models approved by the Finnish safety standards (e.g., EN 3 standard).
6. **Accessibility Modifications**: Install ramps and ensure all entrances comply with the Accessibility Act (627/1999) to accommodate individuals with disabilities.

**6. Compliance Summary**

The building generally adheres to Finnish industrial construction standards of 1993 but falls short in several areas due to subsequent regulatory updates and technological advancements. Key non-compliance issues include electrical wiring, fire safety equipment, plumbing fixtures, and accessibility features. Addressing these will bring the building into alignment with current Finnish building codes and safety standards.

**7. Conclusion**

Upon completion of the inspection on 14.03.2025, the industrial facility in Juva demonstrates a solid structural foundation but requires various updates to meet contemporary safety, energy efficiency, and accessibility requirements. Immediate attention to electrical systems, plumbing repairs, HVAC modernization, fire safety equipment replacement, and accessibility modifications is recommended.
