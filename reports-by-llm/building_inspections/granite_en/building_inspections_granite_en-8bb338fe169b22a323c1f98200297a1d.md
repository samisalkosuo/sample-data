**3. Inspection Context**

- **Weather Conditions:** On the inspection date, the weather was mild for early January in Parainen, with temperatures around -4°C and light snowfall, which did not impede access or visibility significantly. The inspection was conducted as a routine annual check to ensure ongoing compliance with local building codes and safety standards.

**4. Observations and Findings**

- **Structural:** The reinforced concrete structure showed minor signs of cracking in non-load-bearing areas, consistent with natural settling over time. No immediate structural concerns were identified.
- **Electrical:** Electrical systems appeared up to code, with modern wiring and appropriate circuit breakers. Some outlets required updating to accommodate current safety standards regarding ground fault circuit interrupters (GFCIs).
- **Plumbing:** Plumbing fixtures were generally in good condition, though minor leaks were noted around faucets requiring maintenance. Water supply lines appeared corrosion-free, typical for copper pipes of this vintage.
- **HVAC:** Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems functioned adequately. The heat pump showed signs of wear but remained efficient. Regular servicing is recommended to maintain optimal performance.
- **Fire Safety:** Fire alarm system was operational, though battery backups needed replacement in accordance with manufacturer guidelines. Smoke detectors were present on each floor and checked for functionality.
- **Accessibility:** The building complied with accessibility standards, featuring ramps and elevators suitable for wheelchair users. However, a few door thresholds could benefit from smoother transitions to meet current accessibility codes fully.

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

1. Address minor cracking in non-structural areas of the reinforced concrete with sealant application to prevent water ingress.
2. Update electrical outlets to include GFCIs, particularly in kitchen and bathroom areas.
3. Repair leaking faucets and inspect plumbing connections for potential future issues.
4. Replace fire alarm system battery backups promptly to ensure continuous operation.
5. Smooth door thresholds to meet current accessibility standards fully.

**6. Compliance Summary**

The building generally complies with Finnish building codes (e.g., SUK 1:2019 - Building Code) for commercial structures of its age and type, with a few areas requiring attention to maintain or enhance compliance. Immediate corrective actions are recommended for electrical, plumbing, fire safety, and minor accessibility adjustments.
