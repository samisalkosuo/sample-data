**Official Building Inspection Report**

**1. General Information**

- Country: Finland
- Municipality: Lapua
- Address: Kauppakatu 23, 37100 Lapua, Finland
- Inspection Date: 06.12.2024
- Inspector Name: Jari P. Lehtinen

**2. Building Overview**

- Type: Public (Community Center)
- Construction Year: 1993
- Number of Floors: Two-story building with a basement level
- Primary Materials: Reinforced concrete structure, brick facade, timber framing for interior partitions

**3. Inspection Context**

- Weather Conditions: The inspection was conducted under partly cloudy skies with a temperature of -5Â°C and light snowfall, typical for the early winter season in Lapua, Finland.
- Purpose of Inspection: Routine safety and compliance check prior to the upcoming winter maintenance schedule.

**4. Observations and Findings**

*Structural:*  
The building's structural integrity appears sound with no visible signs of distress or settlement. The reinforced concrete foundation and load-bearing walls are in good condition, consistent with their age and construction standards of the early 1990s.

*Electrical:*  
The electrical system shows some outdated components, including non-grounded outlets and older wiring. While functional, these elements do not meet current Finnish safety standards (FS 3101:2018).

*Plumbing:*  
Plumbing fixtures are generally in working order, though there are signs of minor corrosion in exposed copper pipes, particularly in the basement. This may warrant replacement to prevent leaks or water quality issues.

*HVAC:*  
The heating system (district heating connection) is operational but shows signs of inefficiency, with higher-than-expected energy consumption compared to modern systems. Insulation levels around pipes and within walls could be improved for better thermal performance.

*Fire Safety:*  
Smoke detectors are present on each floor but require battery replacement as indicated by low battery signals. Fire extinguishers are located according to code but some appear expired, necessitating immediate attention.

*Accessibility:*  
The building has ramp access for wheelchair users, though the handrails along these ramps show wear and need repair or replacement to ensure safety compliance with the Accessibility Act (628/1999).

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

- Upgrade electrical system to comply with FS 3101:2018 standards, including grounding and replacing outdated wiring.
- Replace corroded copper pipes in the basement to prevent potential leaks and water damage.
- Improve HVAC efficiency by enhancing insulation and considering modern heating solutions for long-term cost savings.
- Replace batteries in smoke detectors and ensure all fire extinguishers are serviceable and within expiration dates.
- Repair or replace worn handrails on accessibility ramps to meet current safety regulations.

**6. Compliance Summary**

The building generally complies with Finnish building codes (BS 5837:2019) but falls short in several areas related to electrical safety, plumbing integrity, fire protection, and accessibility features. Immediate attention is advised for non-compliant elements to ensure public safety and adherence to regulatory standards.

**7. Conclusion**

Upon completion of the routine inspection on 06.12.2024, by Inspector Jari P. Lehtinen, the community center in Lapua demonstrates a mix of well-maintained structural components and areas requiring immediate attention to meet current safety and accessibility standards. It is recommended that the municipality of Lapua prioritize remedial actions for electrical, plumbing, fire safety, and accessibility issues to ensure the building's ongoing compliance and public safety.
