- Address: Kauppakatu 23, 37400 Hämeenkyrö, Finland  
- Inspection Date: 01.03.2025  
- Inspector Name: Jari Pekkarinen

**2. Building Overview**

- Type: Residential  
- Construction Year: 1980  
- Number of Floors: Two (ground floor and first floor)  
- Primary Materials: Reinforced concrete frame with timber framing, brick veneer, and asphalt shingle roof.

**3. Inspection Context**

- Weather Conditions: The inspection was conducted under partly cloudy skies with a temperature of 5°C and light winds, typical for early spring in Hämeenkyrö.  
- Purpose of Inspection: Routine annual check.

**4. Observations and Findings**

*Structural:*  
The building's structural integrity appears sound, with the reinforced concrete frame showing minimal signs of deterioration. The timber framing within the masonry is in good condition, though some areas exhibit minor wood rot requiring attention.

*Electrical:*  
The electrical system includes a mix of older and newer components. While the main service panel appears functional, there are outdated wiring configurations that do not meet current safety standards. Recommend updating to comply with Finnish electrical code KE-101.

*Plumbing:*  
Plumbing consists primarily of galvanized steel pipes showing signs of corrosion and mineral buildup, potentially leading to reduced water flow or leaks. Suggest replacing sections with modern PVC or copper piping to prevent future issues.

*HVAC:*  
The heating system is an old oil-fired boiler with radiator baseboard heating. It functions adequately but lacks modern efficiency standards. Consider upgrading to a high-efficiency condensing boiler or transitioning to a more sustainable heating solution like heat pump technology.

*Fire Safety:*  
Smoke detectors are present on each floor, but they require battery replacement and testing. Install interconnected smoke alarms with long-life batteries for improved safety. Additionally, the absence of a fire sprinkler system in this residential building is noted as per current Finnish regulations (Laki 468/2011).

*Accessibility:*  
The property has one entrance level suitable for wheelchair users, but interior doorways are narrower than recommended by the Accessibility Act (579/2011), necessitating modifications to ensure compliance.

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

- Update electrical wiring to meet KE-101 standards.
- Replace corroded plumbing sections with modern materials.
- Upgrade heating system for energy efficiency and compliance.
- Install or upgrade smoke detectors to interconnected, long-life battery models.
- Consider fire sprinkler installation if extensive renovations are planned.
- Modify interior doorways to meet accessibility standards.

**6. Compliance Summary**

The building generally complies with current Finnish building codes (e.g., Sähköilmiöudetuslaki, BW 38) but requires updates in electrical systems, plumbing, heating, fire safety, and accessibility to meet contemporary standards fully.

**7. Conclusion**

The residential property at Kauppakatu 23 demonstrates a solid structural foundation with some aging components necessitating modernization for safety, efficiency, and compliance. Immediate attention is advised for electrical, plumbing, HVAC systems, fire safety improvements, and accessibility modifications to ensure the dwelling meets current regulatory requirements and occupant comfort standards.
