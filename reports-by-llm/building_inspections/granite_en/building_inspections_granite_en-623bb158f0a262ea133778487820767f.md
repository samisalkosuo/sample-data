**4. Observations and Findings**

*Structural:*  
The structural integrity of the building appears sound with no visible signs of settlement or distress. The reinforced concrete foundation and frame are in good condition, consistent with the 2015 construction era.

*Electrical:*  
The electrical system is generally compliant but requires updating to meet current safety standards. Some outlets lack ground-fault circuit interrupters (GFCIs) in areas prone to moisture, such as kitchens and bathrooms. Wiring insulation shows minor wear, suggesting potential future risks.

*Plumbing:*  
Plumbing fixtures are functional but exhibit signs of minor corrosion, particularly in the basement level. Water supply lines show some discoloration indicative of mineral buildup, potentially reducing water flow efficiency over time.

*HVAC:*  
The heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system operates effectively. However, the heat exchanger in the air handler shows signs of moderate fouling, which may impact efficiency if not cleaned professionally.

*Fire Safety:*  
Smoke detectors are present on each floor but require battery replacement as indicated by low battery signals. The fire extinguisher is located and accessible but expired (expiration date: 31.12.2023).

*Accessibility:*  
The property has a ramp leading to the entrance, complying with accessibility standards for individuals with mobility challenges. However, interior doorways are narrower than recommended current standards, posing potential barriers for wheelchair users.

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

- **Electrical:** Upgrade electrical system to include GFCIs in all required areas and replace wiring showing significant wear.
- **Plumbing:** Inspect and replace corroded sections of plumbing, particularly in the basement, to prevent leaks and maintain water pressure.
- **HVAC:** Schedule professional cleaning of the heat exchanger to restore efficiency.
- **Fire Safety:** Replace expired fire extinguisher and test/replace batteries in smoke detectors. Consider installing interconnected smoke alarms for enhanced safety.
- **Accessibility:** Widen interior doorways to meet current accessibility standards, ensuring ease of movement for individuals with mobility aids.

**6. Compliance Summary**

The building generally complies with Finnish residential construction codes (e.g., SFS-ISO 14001 for environmental management and SFS-EN 13757 for structural safety). However, specific non-compliance issues have been identified in electrical, plumbing, fire safety, and accessibility areas, necessitating corrective actions to ensure full adherence.

**7. Conclusion**

Upon completion of the routine inspection on 28.09.2024, the residential property at Kauppakatu 23, Kerava, Finland, was found to be structurally sound with minor system-related issues. Immediate attention is recommended for electrical, plumbing, fire safety, and accessibility enhancements to maintain compliance and ensure occupant safety and comfort.
