**Official Building Inspection Report**

**1. General Information**

- Country: Finland
- Municipality: Parikkala
- Address: Kauppakatu 23, 47100 Parikkala, Finland
- Inspection Date: 30.05.2025
- Inspector Name: Jari Pietilä

**2. Building Overview**

- Type: Residential (Single-family detached house)
- Construction Year: 1988
- Number of Floors: Two
- Primary Materials: Reinforced concrete frame with timber framing, brick veneer, and asphalt shingle roof

**3. Inspection Context**

- Weather Conditions: The inspection was conducted under partly cloudy skies with a temperature of 15°C and moderate humidity, typical for the late spring in Parikkala, Finland.
- Purpose of Inspection: Routine annual building inspection for maintenance planning purposes.

**4. Observations and Findings**

*Structural:*  
The structural integrity of the building appears sound with minimal signs of settlement or distress. The reinforced concrete frame exhibits no cracking beyond minor hairline fractures, consistent with its age. Timber framing shows some evidence of insect activity (wood-boring beetles), necessitating further investigation and potential treatment.

*Electrical:*  
The electrical system is generally compliant but outdated. Some wiring insulation appears deteriorated, posing a fire hazard. Recommend replacement with modern, code-compliant materials. The circuit breaker panel requires upgrading to meet current safety standards.

*Plumbing:*  
Plumbing fixtures are functional but show signs of corrosion in copper pipes, particularly around joints. Water pressure is within acceptable limits. Recommend inspection and possible replacement of affected sections to prevent leaks and potential water damage.

*HVAC:*  
The heating system (oil-fired boiler) operates adequately but lacks modern efficiency features. Insulation in ductwork is insufficient, leading to heat loss. Suggest upgrading to a more efficient heating solution and improving insulation.

*Fire Safety:*  
Smoke detectors are present on each floor but require battery replacement. A fire extinguisher is located but appears outdated; it should be checked for serviceability and replaced if necessary. Installation of interconnected smoke alarms and a fire alarm system is recommended.

*Accessibility:*  
The property has no significant accessibility barriers for typical residential use. However, improvements such as installing grab bars in bathrooms and ensuring smooth transitions between floor levels could enhance accessibility for individuals with mobility challenges.

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

- Address timber framing insect infestation promptly to prevent structural damage.
- Replace deteriorated electrical wiring and upgrade the circuit breaker panel.
- Inspect and replace corroded plumbing sections, ensuring proper waterproofing.
- Upgrade HVAC system for energy efficiency and improve ductwork insulation.
- Replace smoke detector batteries and check fire extinguisher serviceability; consider installing a comprehensive fire alarm system.
- Enhance accessibility features such as grab bars and smooth transition areas.

**6. Compliance Summary**

The building generally complies with current Finnish Building Code (Asetukset 2018) standards, though several components require updating to meet contemporary safety and efficiency requirements. Specifically, electrical, plumbing, HVAC systems, and fire safety measures need attention to ensure full compliance.

**7. Conclusion**

This inspection reveals a residential property in Parikkala that, while structurally sound, requires various updates to meet modern standards of safety, efficiency, and accessibility. Immediate actions are recommended for electrical, plumbing, HVAC systems, and fire safety improvements. Further investigation into the timber framing infestation is advised.
