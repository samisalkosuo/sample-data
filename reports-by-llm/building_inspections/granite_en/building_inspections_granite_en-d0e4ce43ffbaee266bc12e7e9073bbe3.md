**Official Building Inspection Report**

**1. General Information**

- Country: Finland  
- Municipality: Rusko  
- Address: Kauppakatu 23, 80100 Rusko, Finland  
- Inspection Date: 06.07.2025  
- Inspector Name: Jari P. Lehtinen

**2. Building Overview**

- Type: Commercial (Retail Store)  
- Construction Year: 2003  
- Number of Floors: Two-story building with a basement level  
- Primary Materials: Reinforced concrete structure, brick facade, and timber roof construction common for the era.

**3. Inspection Context**

- Weather Conditions: Clear skies with temperature at 18Â°C, typical for early July in Rusko, Finland. The inspection was conducted as a routine annual check to ensure ongoing compliance with local building codes and safety standards.

**4. Observations and Findings**

*Structural:*  
- Foundation: Generally sound, with minor cracking observed, consistent with settling over two decades. No immediate concern.  
- Load-bearing walls and columns: In good condition, no signs of distress or damage.  
- Roof: Timber trusses and covering show age-related wear but are structurally intact. Recommendation for inspection by a specialist in timber structures within the next year.

*Electrical:*  
- Wiring: Mostly updated to current standards, though some older sections near original fittings require attention due to potential degradation of insulation.  
- Lighting fixtures: A mix of modern and older models; suggest full replacement to ensure energy efficiency and safety compliance.

*Plumbing:*  
- Water supply lines: Primarily copper, in good condition with minor corrosion noted at joints. Recommend inspection of hidden sections during renovation or extensive repair if planned.  
- Drainage system: Functional but shows signs of mineral buildup; cleaning and potential material replacement in older sections advised.

*HVAC:*  
- Heating system: Older gas boiler functioning adequately, though efficiency could be improved with modernization. Suggest evaluation for heat pump integration to align with current energy standards.  
- Ventilation: Basic system present but insufficient for modern commercial use; recommend upgrade to meet current air quality and energy recovery standards.

*Fire Safety:*  
- Fire alarm system: Outdated, non-compliant with current regulations. Full replacement recommended.  
- Fire extinguishers: Some are expired; all should be replaced immediately and checked annually thereafter.  
- Emergency exits: Clearly marked but one exit requires adjustment for wheelchair accessibility.

*Accessibility:*  
- Ramp access to the building is present but steep, not compliant with current standards. Recommend redesign for easier use by individuals with mobility impairments.

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

1. Address foundation cracks with monitoring or minor reinforcement as necessary.
2. Update electrical wiring to ensure full compliance and efficiency.
3. Replace outdated lighting fixtures with modern, energy-efficient models.
4. Inspect hidden plumbing sections and clean/replace components showing signs of degradation.
5. Modernize heating system and consider heat pump integration for improved efficiency.
6. Upgrade HVAC ventilation to meet current standards for air quality and energy recovery.
7. Replace fire alarm system entirely to ensure compliance with safety regulations.
8. Replace expired fire extinguishers and establish an annual inspection schedule.
9. Adjust ramp gradient to comply with accessibility standards.

**6. Compliance Summary**

The building demonstrates overall structural integrity but falls short in several areas concerning electrical, plumbing, HVAC, fire safety, and accessibility compliance with current Finnish regulations. Immediate attention is required for fire safety systems and gradual modernization of other systems to ensure full adherence to contemporary standards.

**7. Conclusion**

This inspection reveals that while the building's core structure remains sound, various systems require updating to meet present-day Finnish building codes and safety requirements. It is recommended that the property owner prioritize the outlined improvements for continued safe and legal operation.
