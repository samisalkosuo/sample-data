**4. Observations and Findings**

*Structural:*  
The structural integrity of the building appears sound with no visible signs of settlement or distress. The foundation and load-bearing walls are in good condition, consistent with a modern wood frame construction.

*Electrical:*  
The electrical system is generally compliant with current Finnish standards (FS 3101:2018). However, minor discrepancies were noted in the ground fault circuit interrupter (GFCI) protection in bathroom outlets, which should be addressed to ensure safety.

*Plumbing:*  
Plumbing fixtures are in working order with no leaks identified. The water heater shows signs of corrosion and is recommended for replacement to prevent potential future issues.

*HVAC:*  
The heating system (underfloor radiant heating) functions efficiently. However, the air conditioning unit requires servicing as it was inoperative during the inspection.

*Fire Safety:*  
Smoke detectors are installed on each floor and connected to a central alarm system, meeting Finnish fire safety regulations (FS 1234:2020). Fire extinguishers are present but require recharging.

*Accessibility:*  
The property has ramp access at the entrance, complying with accessibility standards for residential buildings in Finland (Laki 736/2011). However, interior doorways could benefit from wider clearances to improve ease of movement for individuals using mobility aids.
