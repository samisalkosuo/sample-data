*Structural:*  
The building's structural integrity appears sound, with no visible signs of settlement or distress. The reinforced concrete foundation and timber framing adhere to modern Finnish construction standards.

The electrical system is generally compliant but requires updating of some ground fault circuit interrupters (GFCIs) in bathrooms and kitchen areas to meet current safety codes. Wiring appears in good condition with adequate protection against moisture intrusion.

*Plumbing:*  
Plumbing fixtures are in satisfactory condition, though minor leaks were noted around the main water supply valve, suggesting potential for future issues if addressed promptly.

*HVAC:*  
The heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system functions adequately. However, the heat pump efficiency could be improved by ensuring proper insulation in less-used areas like attic spaces to minimize heat loss.

*Fire Safety:*  
Smoke detectors are installed on each floor as required, but battery levels need checking and replacement where necessary. Fire extinguishers are present and accessible, though one unit's expiration date has passed (recommend replacement).

*Accessibility:*  
The building meets accessibility standards with ramp access to the entrance and elevator provision for upper floors, ensuring compliance with Finnish Accessibility Act 2016.
