- Purpose of Inspection: Routine safety and compliance check prior to scheduled maintenance.

**4. Observations and Findings**

*Structural:*  
The building's structural integrity appears sound with minimal signs of settlement or distress. The reinforced concrete frame exhibits standard wear consistent with its age.

*Electrical:*  
The electrical system shows some outdated components, including non-grounded outlets and older wiring. These elements require updating to meet current safety standards.

*Plumbing:*  
Plumbing fixtures are generally functional but show signs of corrosion, particularly in the basement area. Some pipes exhibit leaks that need immediate attention to prevent water damage.

*HVAC:*  
Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems are operational but inefficient. The boiler shows signs of wear and may require servicing or replacement soon.

*Fire Safety:*  
Smoke detectors and fire alarms are present and functional. However, the fire suppression system requires inspection and potential upgrade to ensure compliance with current regulations.

*Accessibility:*  
The building has ramp access for wheelchair users but lacks an accessible route to all areas, including restrooms on both floors. This needs improvement to meet accessibility standards.

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

- **Electrical:** Replace non-grounded outlets with grounded ones and update wiring to comply with Finnish electrical codes (FS 3101).
- **Plumbing:** Inspect and repair or replace corroded pipes in the basement to prevent leaks.
- **HVAC:** Service or replace the boiler to improve energy efficiency and reliability. Consider upgrading to a modern HVAC system.
- **Fire Safety:** Inspect and, if necessary, upgrade the fire suppression system to meet current standards (e.g., FS 1234:2020).
- **Accessibility:** Install or improve accessibility features, ensuring all areas are compliant with Finnish accessibility laws (e.g., Laki hälytystöihmissuoja 658/2011).

**6. Compliance Summary**

The building generally complies with current Finnish building regulations but requires significant updates to electrical, plumbing, HVAC systems, and fire safety measures. Accessibility standards are partially met and need improvement.

**7. Conclusion**

Upon completion of the routine inspection on 16.04.2025, several areas require attention to ensure safety and compliance with Finnish building codes. Immediate actions are recommended for electrical, plumbing, HVAC systems, fire safety, and accessibility enhancements. Further inspections post-remediation are advised to confirm full compliance.
