**Official Building Inspection Report**

**1. General Information**

- Country: Finland
- Municipality: Pyhäntä
- Address: Kauppakatu 23, 40100 Pyhäntä
- Inspection Date: 05.12.2024 (DD.MM.YYYY)
- Inspector Name: Jari Pietilä

**2. Building Overview**

- Type: Industrial
- Construction Year: 1974
- Number of Floors: Two-story structure
- Primary Materials: Reinforced concrete frame with brick and timber cladding

**3. Inspection Context**

Weather conditions on the inspection date were mild for late autumn in Finland, with temperatures around 5°C and light rainfall. The purpose of this routine inspection was to assess the overall condition of the industrial building for compliance with current safety standards and to identify any necessary maintenance or renovation needs.

**4. Observations and Findings**

- **Structural Integrity**: The reinforced concrete frame shows signs of minor cracking, consistent with age and typical weather exposure in Finland's climate. No immediate structural concerns were identified.
- **Electrical Systems**: Wiring appears to be original and shows some deterioration. Recommend replacement to meet current safety standards.
- **Plumbing**: Galvanized steel pipes show signs of corrosion, necessitating replacement to prevent leaks and water quality issues.
- **HVAC**: The heating system functions but is inefficient and outdated. Suggest upgrading to a modern, energy-efficient solution for cost savings and environmental compliance.
- **Fire Safety**: Fire alarm system is present but lacks recent testing records. Recommend inspection and maintenance by a certified professional.
- **Accessibility**: The building does not meet current accessibility standards due to lack of ramps and insufficient door widths, necessitating modifications for compliance with the Finnish Accessibility Act (Hänen käyttöihmisen suojaamisesta ja käytössäöllessa olevaan haittaa poistamisesta 3/2018).

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

- **Issue**: Outdated electrical wiring
  - **Recommendation**: Replace all electrical wiring to ensure safety and compliance with Finnish electrical codes (KS E 1647).

- **Issue**: Corroded plumbing system
  - **Recommendation**: Replace galvanized steel pipes with modern, corrosion-resistant materials like copper or PEX.

- **Issue**: Inefficient HVAC system
  - **Recommendation**: Upgrade to an energy-efficient heating solution, such as a heat pump, in compliance with Finnish energy efficiency regulations (Ympäristöministeriön maksutapa 2019).

- **Issue**: Non-compliant fire safety measures
  - **Recommendation**: Conduct a thorough inspection and maintenance of the fire alarm system by a certified professional to ensure it meets Finnish safety standards.

- **Issue**: Lack of accessibility features
  - **Recommendation**: Implement modifications including ramp installation, widening doorways, and ensuring accessible restrooms to comply with the Finnish Accessibility Act.

**6. Compliance Summary**

The building demonstrates compliance with foundational structural integrity but falls short in several areas crucial for safety, efficiency, and accessibility. While the core structure is sound, significant updates are required to meet current Finnish building codes and regulations, particularly concerning electrical systems, plumbing, HVAC, fire safety, and accessibility standards.

**7. Conclusion**

This inspection reveals that while the 1974-constructed industrial building in Pyhäntä retains its structural integrity, extensive modernization is necessary to ensure compliance with contemporary Finnish regulations and standards. Immediate attention should be given to electrical, plumbing, HVAC systems, fire safety measures, and accessibility improvements.
