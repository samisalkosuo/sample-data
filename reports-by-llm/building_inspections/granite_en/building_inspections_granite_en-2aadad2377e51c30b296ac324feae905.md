**Official Building Inspection Report**

**1. General Information**

- **Country**: Finland
- **Municipality**: Sotkamo
- **Address**: Kauppakatu 23, 84600 Sotkamo, Finland (Invented for reporting purposes)
- **Inspection Date**: 21.03.2025 (DD.MM.YYYY format)
- **Inspector Name**: Marko Pietilä

**2. Building Overview**

- **Type**: Industrial
- **Construction Year**: 2001
- **Number of Floors**: Two-story structure, typical for industrial buildings from that era in Finland, facilitating efficient use of space and minimizing environmental impact through design.
- **Primary Materials**: The building predominantly features reinforced concrete construction with a timber frame, reflecting common practices in Finnish industrial architecture during the early 2000s, balancing durability with sustainable material usage.

**3. Inspection Context**

- **Weather Conditions**: On the inspection date, clear weather conditions prevailed with temperatures around -4°C and light snowfall, typical for late March in Sotkamo, Finland. Such conditions allowed for a thorough external examination without interference from adverse weather that could obscure details.
- **Purpose of Inspection**: Routine safety and compliance check as mandated by local authorities to ensure ongoing adherence to building codes and safety standards.

**4. Observations and Findings**

- **Structural Integrity**: The reinforced concrete structure showed minor signs of cracking, consistent with natural material aging in Finland's climate. No immediate structural concerns were identified.
- **Electrical Systems**: Wiring appeared well-maintained, though some older components suggested a phased upgrade might be prudent to meet current safety standards.
- **Plumbing**: Plumbing fixtures were functional but showed signs of corrosion in exposed sections, indicating potential for future leaks if addressed promptly.
- **HVAC Systems**: Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems operated adequately, though efficiency could be improved with modernization to reduce energy consumption.
- **Fire Safety**: Fire alarms and suppression systems were present and tested, meeting current regulations; however, periodic maintenance checks are recommended.
- **Accessibility**: The building complied with accessibility standards for its age, but modifications might be necessary to fully accommodate modern disability access requirements.

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

1. **Cracking in Reinforced Concrete**: Schedule a detailed structural engineering assessment to evaluate the extent of cracking and determine if reinforcement is required.
2. **Electrical Upgrades**: Plan for partial electrical system modernization, focusing on replacing outdated components to ensure safety and efficiency.
3. **Plumbing Maintenance**: Address corrosion in exposed plumbing sections with immediate repairs or replacements to prevent future leaks.
4. **HVAC Modernization**: Consider upgrading HVAC systems to more energy-efficient models to reduce operational costs and environmental impact.
5. **Accessibility Enhancements**: Consult accessibility experts for a detailed plan to retrofit the building, ensuring it meets contemporary standards without major structural alterations.

**6. Compliance Summary**

The building generally complies with Finnish industrial building codes from 2001, noting some areas where updates align with evolving safety and efficiency standards. While current compliance is maintained, several recommendations aim to bring the structure in line with modern expectations and regulatory advancements.

**7. Conclusion**

This inspection reveals an industrial building in Sotkamo that, while structurally sound and compliant with its original codes, requires targeted upgrades to address aging components and enhance safety, efficiency, and accessibility. Immediate attention to electrical, plumbing, and HVAC systems alongside a strategic plan for structural assessments and potential accessibility modifications is advised.
