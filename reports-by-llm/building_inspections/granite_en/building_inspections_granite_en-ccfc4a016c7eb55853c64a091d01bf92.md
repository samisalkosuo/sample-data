- Purpose of Inspection: Routine compliance check as part of annual commercial property maintenance requirements.

**4. Observations and Findings**

*Structural:*  
The building's reinforced concrete frame shows signs of minor cracking, consistent with age and typical for structures of this vintage in Finland’s climate. No immediate structural concerns were identified.

*Electrical:*  
Wiring appears to be original and partially outdated. Some non-compliant components noted, including lack of ground fault circuit interrupters (GFCIs) in wet areas. Recommend updating electrical systems to meet current safety standards.

*Plumbing:*  
Plumbing fixtures are generally functional but show signs of corrosion, particularly in older sections. Recommend replacement or refurbishment of affected pipes to prevent leaks and potential water damage.

*HVAC:*  
Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems are operational but inefficient. Suggest upgrading to more energy-efficient models to reduce utility costs and environmental impact.

*Fire Safety:*  
Fire alarm system present and tested; however, smoke detectors require battery replacement due to low voltage readings. Ensure all fire safety equipment is regularly maintained and meets current regulations.

*Accessibility:*  
Building has limited accessibility features, with no elevator installed for the upper floors. Recommend installation of an elevator or ramp to comply with modern accessibility standards.

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

- Address cracking in concrete structure through monitoring and potential reinforcement if expansion continues.
- Upgrade electrical systems, including installation of GFCIs in wet areas and replacement of outdated wiring.
- Replace or refurbish corroded plumbing sections to prevent leaks and ensure water quality.
- Install energy-efficient HVAC units to reduce operational costs and improve environmental performance.
- Service fire alarm system, replace batteries in smoke detectors, and review overall fire safety measures for compliance.
- Install an elevator or ramp to ensure accessibility for all users as per current legislation.

**6. Compliance Summary**

The building generally complies with Finnish Building Code (Tiedotuslaki) but falls short in several areas, notably electrical safety, plumbing integrity, HVAC efficiency, fire safety equipment maintenance, and accessibility provisions. Immediate attention to these issues is advised to ensure full compliance and occupant safety.

**7. Conclusion**

Upon completion of the routine inspection on 21.07.2025, Kauppakatu 23 in Salo demonstrates a structure that, while fundamentally sound, requires updates across various systems to meet contemporary standards and regulations. Immediate action is recommended for electrical, plumbing, HVAC, fire safety, and accessibility improvements.
