**4. Observations and Findings**

*Structural:*  
The building's structural integrity appears sound, with no visible signs of distress or settlement. The reinforced concrete frame and timber floor joists show minimal wear consistent with the age of construction.

*Electrical:*  
The electrical system is generally in good condition, though some wiring insulation shows minor degradation. Recommend updating to meet current safety standards.

*Plumbing:*  
Plumbing fixtures are functional but exhibit signs of corrosion, particularly in older galvanized steel pipes. Suggest replacement with modern materials to prevent future leaks.

*HVAC:*  
Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems are operational but show inefficiencies. Recommend assessment for potential upgrade to energy-efficient models.

*Fire Safety:*  
Smoke detectors and fire alarms are present and functional. However, fire extinguishers require replacement, and the fire escape routes need clearer marking for visibility during winter conditions.

*Accessibility:*  
The building complies with basic accessibility requirements but lacks features such as ramps for wheelchair access, which should be installed to meet current standards fully.

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

- Update electrical wiring to address insulation degradation.
- Replace corroded plumbing sections with modern materials (e.g., PEX or copper).
- Evaluate HVAC system for efficiency improvements or replacement.
- Ensure fire extinguishers are up-to-date and improve visibility of emergency exits.
- Install ramps and other accessibility features to meet current standards.
