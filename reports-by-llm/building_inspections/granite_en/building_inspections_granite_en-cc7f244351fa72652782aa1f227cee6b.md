**Official Building Inspection Report**

**1. General Information**

- Country: Finland
- Municipality: Myrskylä
- Address: Kauppakatu 23, 40800 Myrskylä
- Inspection Date: 08.09.2024 (DD.MM.YYYY)
- Inspector Name: Jari Pekkarinen

**2. Building Overview**

- Type: Industrial
- Construction Year: 1992
- Number of Floors: Two-story structure
- Primary Materials: Reinforced concrete frame with timber flooring and brick facade

**3. Inspection Context**

- Weather Conditions: The inspection was conducted under partly cloudy skies with a temperature of 15°C and moderate humidity, typical for the late summer in Myrskylä.
- Purpose of Inspection: Routine annual compliance check

**4. Observations and Findings**

*Structural:*  
The building's structural integrity appears sound, with no visible signs of distress or deformation in the reinforced concrete frame. The timber flooring shows minor wear consistent with its age but remains serviceable.

*Electrical:*  
The electrical system is outdated, featuring a mix of old wiring and some newer installations. There are concerns regarding overloaded circuits and insufficient ground-fault circuit interrupters (GFCIs) in areas exposed to moisture.

*Plumbing:*  
Plumbing fixtures are generally functional but exhibit signs of corrosion, particularly in older galvanized steel pipes. Some leaks have been identified that require immediate attention to prevent water damage and mold growth.

*HVAC:*  
The heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system is operational but shows signs of inefficiency and potential for improved energy performance. The age of the system suggests a possible upgrade could enhance comfort and reduce utility costs.

*Fire Safety:*  
Smoke detectors are present on each floor, though some batteries are low and need replacement. Fire extinguishers are located but appear to be outdated; they should be inspected and possibly replaced according to current standards.

*Accessibility:*  
The building lacks modern accessibility features such as ramps or automatic doors, which are essential for compliance with current Finnish accessibility laws, particularly considering its public-facing industrial nature.

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

1. **Electrical System:** Upgrade wiring to meet current safety standards and install GFCIs in all required areas.
2. **Plumbing:** Replace corroded sections of pipework, ensuring use of modern, non-corrosive materials.
3. **HVAC:** Evaluate the system for efficiency improvements or replacement to comply with energy performance regulations.
4. **Fire Safety:** Replace outdated fire extinguishers and ensure all smoke detectors are fully functional with fresh batteries.
5. **Accessibility:** Install ramps, automatic doors, and other necessary modifications to meet current accessibility standards.

**6. Compliance Summary**

The building generally complies with structural integrity requirements but falls short in several key areas including electrical safety, plumbing, fire safety measures, HVAC efficiency, and accessibility features. Immediate attention is advised for non-compliant aspects to ensure adherence to Finnish Building Code (Hakuohje) and related regulations.

**7. Conclusion**

This inspection reveals that while the structural framework of the industrial building in Myrskylä remains sound, several critical areas require updating to meet contemporary safety, efficiency, and accessibility standards. It is recommended that the property owner address the identified issues promptly to ensure compliance and enhance the building's functionality and safety.
