- **Purpose of Inspection:** Routine annual compliance check as per local municipal regulations.

**4. Observations and Findings**

*Structural:*  
- Foundation appears sound with no visible cracking or settlement issues.
- Wooden framing shows minor signs of moisture ingress, consistent with age and exposure to Finland's climate.

*Electrical:*  
- Electrical system generally compliant; however, some outdated wiring in less accessible areas requires updating for safety.

*Plumbing:*  
- Plumbing fixtures functional but show signs of minor corrosion, particularly in older pipes. Recommend replacement to prevent future leaks.

*HVAC:*  
- Heating system efficient; however, the air conditioning unit shows reduced efficiency and requires servicing.

*Fire Safety:*  
- Fire alarm system operational, but smoke detectors need battery checks and possible replacement due to age.

*Accessibility:*  
- Building has ramp access meeting current standards, though handrails on one ramp show wear and require reinforcement or replacement.

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

1. **Moisture Management:** Address moisture ingress in timber framing to prevent structural degradation. Consider applying water-resistant treatments or sealants.
   
2. **Electrical Upgrades:** Update outdated wiring, especially in less visible areas, to meet current safety standards.

3. **Plumbing Maintenance:** Replace corroded pipes to avoid future leaks and water damage.

4. **HVAC Servicing:** Service the air conditioning unit for improved efficiency and longevity.

5. **Fire Safety Enhancements:** Conduct battery checks on smoke detectors and replace units as necessary to ensure compliance with fire safety regulations.

6. **Accessibility Improvements:** Reinforce or replace worn handrails on ramps for continued accessibility compliance.

**6. Compliance Summary**

The building largely complies with current Finnish building codes, notably in structural integrity and accessibility features. However, several areas require attention to meet ongoing safety and maintenance standards, particularly concerning electrical systems, plumbing, HVAC efficiency, and fire safety equipment.

**7. Conclusion**

The Mäntsälä Community Center, constructed in 2011, is in generally good condition but requires targeted interventions to address identified issues related to moisture management, electrical systems, plumbing, HVAC maintenance, fire safety equipment, and accessibility features. It is recommended that these actions be prioritized to ensure continued compliance with Finnish building regulations and the safety of occupants and visitors.
