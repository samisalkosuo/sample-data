The building's structural integrity appears sound, with no visible signs of distress or settlement. The reinforced concrete foundation and timber framing are in good condition, consistent with the 2013 construction era.

*Electrical:*  
The electrical system is generally compliant but noted minor issues: outdated wiring in some non-critical areas requiring replacement to meet current safety standards.

*Plumbing:*  
Plumbing fixtures are functional; however, leaks were detected in the basement utility area suggesting potential pipe degradation due to age and moisture exposure.

*HVAC:*  
Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems are operational but show signs of wear, particularly in ductwork insulation which is recommended for upgrading to improve efficiency.

Smoke detectors and fire alarms are present and tested during the inspection; however, fire extinguishers require replacement as they are past their service life.

*Accessibility:*  
The building has ramp access and elevator provision meeting current accessibility standards for public buildings.
