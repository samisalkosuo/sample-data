**Official Building Inspection Report**

**1. General Information**

- Country: Finland
- Municipality: Kannonkoski
- Address: Pohjoiskuja 23, 40100 Kannonkoski, Finland
- Inspection Date: 05.02.2025 (DD.MM.YYYY)
- Inspector Name: Jari Pietilä

**2. Building Overview**

- Type: Commercial (Office Space)
- Construction Year: 1973
- Number of Floors: 3
- Primary Materials: Reinforced concrete structure with brick façade and timber interior finishes

**3. Inspection Context**

Weather conditions on the inspection date were mild for late winter, with temperatures around -5°C and light snowfall. The purpose of this routine inspection was to assess the overall condition of the building for compliance with current safety standards and to provide recommendations for maintenance and potential renovations.

**4. Observations and Findings**

- **Structural**: The reinforced concrete structure showed minor signs of cracking, consistent with age and typical wear. No immediate structural concerns were identified.
- **Electrical**: Electrical systems appeared outdated but functional. Wiring insulation was in good condition, though some non-compliant fixtures were noted.
- **Plumbing**: Plumbing system showed signs of corrosion, particularly in older galvanized steel pipes. Water pressure was adequate, but leaks were detected in several areas requiring immediate attention.
- **HVAC**: Heating and ventilation systems were operational but inefficient. The age of the systems suggested potential for upgrade to modern energy-saving models.
- **Fire Safety**: Fire alarms and suppression systems were present and appeared functional, though manual inspection of smoke detectors revealed some dead batteries needing replacement.
- **Accessibility**: The building lacked ramp access for wheelchair users, failing to meet current accessibility standards.

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

- Address cracking in the concrete structure with monitoring and possible reinforcement where necessary.
- Upgrade electrical fixtures to comply with modern safety codes.
- Replace corroded plumbing sections and address leaks promptly to prevent water damage.
- Consider replacement of HVAC systems for improved energy efficiency and performance.
- Service all fire alarm components, including battery checks and system testing.
- Install ramps or elevators to ensure compliance with accessibility regulations for individuals with mobility impairments.

**6. Compliance Summary**

The building generally complies with Finnish National Building Code (Laki kokonainen muuttuva huoneistotuotantovalmistuksen mukaan) but has several areas requiring immediate attention to meet current safety and accessibility standards. Non-compliance issues include electrical fixture standards, plumbing integrity, HVAC system efficiency, fire alarm maintenance, and lack of adequate accessibility features.

**7. Conclusion**

This inspection reveals that while the 1973 commercial building in Kannonkoski maintains structural integrity, it faces several pressing maintenance needs to ensure safety and legal compliance. Immediate actions are recommended for electrical, plumbing, HVAC systems, fire safety equipment, and accessibility improvements. Further detailed engineering assessments may be necessary for comprehensive repair planning.
