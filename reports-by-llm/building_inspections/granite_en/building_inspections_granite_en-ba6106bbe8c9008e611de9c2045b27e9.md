- Purpose of Inspection: Routine annual building safety check.

**4. Observations and Findings**

*Structural:*  
The building's foundation appears sound with no visible cracks or settlement issues. The structural framing shows minor signs of wood decay in the basement level, which is typical for its age and exposure to moisture.

*Electrical:*  
Wiring is generally in good condition but some outdated components were identified that may require upgrading to meet current safety standards. The electrical panel appears functional but could benefit from a modern replacement to ensure compliance with contemporary codes.

*Plumbing:*  
Plumbing systems are in reasonable condition, though there are signs of minor corrosion in older copper pipes, particularly in the basement. Recommendations for partial pipe replacement are suggested to prevent future leaks.

*HVAC:*  
The heating system (district heating connection) is operational but could be more energy-efficient. Insulation levels around windows and doors are adequate for the building's age, though upgrading could reduce heat loss in colder months.

*Fire Safety:*  
Smoke detectors are present on each floor as required by Finnish fire safety regulations. However, they may need battery replacement or potential upgrade to interconnected alarms for enhanced protection.

*Accessibility:*  
The building complies with basic accessibility standards for its construction era, though improvements such as installing ramps and widening doorways could enhance accessibility for individuals with mobility challenges.

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

- Address wood decay in basement timber framing promptly to prevent structural integrity issues.
- Upgrade electrical components and consider replacing the electrical panel to meet current safety standards.
- Replace corroded sections of copper plumbing to avoid potential leaks.
- Evaluate modern, energy-efficient HVAC options for improved performance and cost savings.
