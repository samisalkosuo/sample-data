**1. General Information**

- Country: Finland
- Municipality: Tuusula
- Address: Kauppakatu 23, 04510 Tuusula
- Inspection Date: 19.10.2024 (DD.MM.YYYY)
- Inspector Name: Jari Pekkarinen

**2. Building Overview**

- Type: Industrial
- Construction Year: 2019
- Number of Floors: Two-story structure with a mezzanine level, totaling three levels.
- Primary Materials: Reinforced concrete frame with exterior cladding in Finnish timber and glass, interior walls finished in drywall.

**3. Inspection Context**

- Weather Conditions: The inspection was conducted under partly cloudy skies with a temperature of 8°C and moderate winds, typical for the autumn season in Tuusula.
- Purpose of Inspection: Routine safety and compliance check.

**4. Observations and Findings**

*Structural:*  
The building's structural integrity appears sound with no visible signs of distress or settlement. The reinforced concrete frame meets contemporary standards for industrial construction in Finland.

*Electrical:*  
The electrical system is generally compliant, though minor discrepancies were noted in ground fault circuit interrupter (GFCI) protection in wet areas, requiring immediate attention to ensure safety compliance with Finnish Electrical Safety Act (Ensimmäinen elektrikkovarjoituksen laki 2018:47).

*Plumbing:*  
Plumbing fixtures are in good condition, but there is evidence of minor water leakage around the base of several sinks and toilets. This suggests potential issues with sealing or pipe connections that need addressing to prevent water damage and mold growth.

*HVAC:*  
The heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system functions adequately but shows signs of inefficient insulation around ductwork, leading to energy loss. Recommendation is to retrofit with improved thermal insulation materials to meet Finnish Building Regulations (Habitats- ja ruokaasemuksen laki 2018:34).

*Fire Safety:*  
The fire safety measures, including smoke detectors and sprinkler systems, are present and appear operational. However, the emergency lighting requires battery replacement as per Finnish Fire Safety Act (Varjoihmisen turvallisuuslaki 2018:56).

*Accessibility:*  
The building complies with accessibility standards for industrial use, featuring ramps and elevators suitable for wheelchair users. However, signage could be improved to clearly indicate emergency exits and evacuation routes.

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

- Address electrical GFCI compliance issues in wet areas promptly.
- Repair leaking plumbing fixtures to prevent water damage.
- Insulate HVAC ductwork to enhance energy efficiency.
- Replace batteries in emergency lighting systems.
- Enhance accessibility signage for clearer emergency procedures.

**6. Compliance Summary**

The building generally complies with Finnish building regulations, notably the Building Regulations Act (Habitats- ja ruokaasemuksen laki 2018:34) and the Electrical Safety Act (Ensimmäinen elektrikkovarjoituksen laki 2018:47). However, there are specific areas requiring immediate attention to maintain full compliance with safety standards.

**7. Conclusion**

The industrial building at Kauppakatu 23, Tuusula, demonstrates satisfactory structural integrity and adherence to contemporary Finnish construction practices for its age. Noted issues are minor and correctable with timely interventions. It is recommended that the property owner address the identified electrical, plumbing, HVAC, fire safety, and accessibility concerns to ensure ongoing compliance and occupant safety.
