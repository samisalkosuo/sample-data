**4. Observations and Findings**

*Structural:*  
The structural frame appears sound, with no significant signs of deterioration or damage. The foundation shows minor cracking, common for buildings of this age, but no immediate concern is identified.

*Electrical:*  
Wiring is presently compliant with Finnish electrical codes (FS 34-100), though some outlets show signs of wear and may require replacement to meet current safety standards.

*Plumbing:*  
Plumbing systems are functional, but there are indications of minor leaks in the copper pipes leading to potential water damage if not addressed promptly.

*HVAC:*  
The heating system (district heating connection) is operational and efficient for the building's size. However, the ventilation system could be improved for better air quality management.

*Fire Safety:*  
Smoke detectors are installed on each floor as required by Finnish fire safety regulations (FS 123-1). The fire doors are present and functioning correctly.

*Accessibility:*  
The building has a ramp providing access to the entrance, complying with accessibility standards for residential buildings constructed post-1994. However, interior doorways could benefit from wider clearances to enhance ease of use for individuals with mobility aids.

- Replace worn electrical outlets to ensure compliance with current safety standards (FS 34-100).
- Repair leaking pipes to prevent water damage and potential mold growth.
- Upgrade ventilation system for improved air quality, considering modern energy-efficient solutions.
- Widen interior door clearances to meet or exceed accessibility guidelines.

**6. Compliance Summary**

The building generally complies with current Finnish building codes (FS 34-100 for electrical, FS 123-1 for fire safety, and accessibility standards post-1994 construction). However, some areas require updates to meet contemporary standards and prevent potential hazards.

**7. Conclusion**
