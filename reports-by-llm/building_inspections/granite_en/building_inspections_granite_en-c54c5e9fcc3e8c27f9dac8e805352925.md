**Official Building Inspection Report**

**1. General Information**

- Country: Finland
- Municipality: Ristijärvi
- Address: Kauppakatu 23, 40100 Ristijärvi, Finland
- Inspection Date: 03.03.2025 (DD.MM.YYYY format)
- Inspector Name: Jari Pekka Hietanen

**2. Building Overview**

- Type: Residential
- Construction Year: 1974
- Number of Floors: Two-story building with a pitched roof, typical for residential construction in the era.
- Primary Materials: Wood frame construction with brick veneer and asphalt shingles, common in Finnish residential buildings from that period.

**3. Inspection Context**

- Weather Conditions: On the inspection date, clear skies with a temperature of -5°C were observed, typical for early spring in Ristijärvi.
- Purpose of Inspection: Routine annual building safety check.

**4. Observations and Findings**

*Structural:*  
The foundation appears sound, with no visible cracks or settlement issues. The framing shows minor signs of wood rot around window and door frames, indicative of age-related deterioration.

*Electrical:*  
The electrical system is outdated, featuring ungrounded two-prong outlets. Wiring insulation in some areas appears frayed, posing a potential fire hazard. The main panel lacks modern safety features like arc-fault circuit interrupters (AFCIs).

*Plumbing:*  
Galvanized steel pipes are present throughout; signs of corrosion and reduced water flow suggest the need for replacement to prevent leaks and improve efficiency. No immediate leaks were detected during inspection.

*HVAC:*  
The heating system, a gas-fired boiler with radiators, functions but shows signs of inefficiency. Ductwork insulation is absent or degraded, leading to heat loss. The cooling system (window unit) is non-functional and should be replaced for occupant comfort.

*Fire Safety:*  
Smoke detectors are present on each floor but require battery replacement. There is a lack of sprinkler systems, which would be recommended for enhanced fire safety in residential buildings of this age and construction.

*Accessibility:*  
The building does not meet current accessibility standards due to narrow doorways and lack of ramp access, posing challenges for individuals with mobility impairments.

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

- Address wood rot around window and door frames by replacing affected materials.
- Upgrade electrical system to include grounded three-prong outlets and modern safety features such as AFCIs.
- Replace corroded galvanized steel pipes with copper or PEX for improved water quality and flow.
- Install or upgrade the HVAC system, including proper ductwork insulation and a more efficient cooling solution.
- Install or service smoke detectors with non-replaceable batteries and consider installing a sprinkler system for fire safety.
- Modify doorways and install ramps to ensure compliance with accessibility standards.

**6. Compliance Summary**

The building partially complies with current Finnish residential building codes (e.g., KV145, KV200). While the structural integrity is maintained, several systems (electrical, plumbing, HVAC, fire safety, and accessibility) require significant upgrades to meet contemporary standards and ensure occupant safety and comfort.

**7. Conclusion**

This residential building in Ristijärvi, constructed in 1974, requires comprehensive renovations to address multiple deficiencies identified during the inspection. Immediate attention is advised for electrical, plumbing, HVAC systems, and fire safety measures. Accessibility modifications are also necessary to ensure compliance with current regulations promoting inclusivity.
