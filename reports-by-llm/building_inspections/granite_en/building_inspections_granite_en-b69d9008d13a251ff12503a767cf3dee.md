**Official Building Inspection Report**

**1. General Information**

- Country: Finland
- Municipality: Sonkajärvi
- Address: Kauppakatu 23, 40100 Sonkajärvi, Finland
- Inspection Date: 09.03.2025 (DD.MM.YYYY)
- Inspector Name: Marko Pietilä

**2. Building Overview**

- Type: Industrial (Manufacturing Facility)
- Construction Year: 1970
- Number of Floors: Two-story structure
- Primary Materials: Reinforced concrete frame, timber framing, and brick veneer cladding

**3. Inspection Context**

- Weather Conditions: Overcast with intermittent light rain; typical for early spring in Sonkajärvi.
- Purpose of Inspection: Routine safety and compliance check prior to planned maintenance.

**4. Observations and Findings**

*Structural:*  
The building's reinforced concrete frame shows signs of minor cracking, consistent with age and environmental exposure. The timber framing within the structure appears sound but exhibits some moisture-related degradation in a few areas.

*Electrical:*  
Wiring is outdated, using cloth-insulated cables that are no longer compliant with current standards. Some junction boxes show signs of corrosion and potential fire hazard.

*Plumbing:*  
Galvanized steel pipes display significant corrosion, leading to reduced water flow in several fixtures. Evidence of past leaks suggests the need for replacement.

*HVAC:*  
The heating system, comprising old oil-fired boilers, is operational but highly inefficient and non-compliant with modern emission standards. Cooling is provided by window units, insufficient for industrial use.

*Fire Safety:*  
Fire alarm system is absent; emergency lighting is partially functional. Fire doors are present but show signs of wear and potential malfunction.

*Accessibility:*  
The building lacks ramp access for individuals with mobility impairments, failing to meet current accessibility standards.

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

- **Structural:** Schedule a detailed structural assessment by a civil engineer to evaluate the extent of cracking and propose reinforcement or repair strategies.
- **Electrical:** Upgrade wiring to comply with Finnish safety regulations (e.g., replace cloth insulation with modern alternatives). Address corrosion in junction boxes promptly to mitigate fire risk.
- **Plumbing:** Replace corroded steel pipes with compliant materials like PVC or copper. Inspect for and address any hidden leaks to prevent future damage.
- **HVAC:** Evaluate options for modern, energy-efficient heating solutions (e.g., heat pumps) and consider centralized cooling systems suitable for industrial operations.
- **Fire Safety:** Install a comprehensive fire alarm system and ensure all emergency lighting is fully functional. Conduct regular checks on fire doors to maintain operational integrity.
- **Accessibility:** Design and implement an access ramp or lift to comply with Finnish accessibility laws, ensuring the building is accessible to all users.

**6. Compliance Summary**

The current state of the industrial facility demonstrates non-compliance with several aspects of Finnish building codes, particularly concerning electrical safety, plumbing integrity, HVAC efficiency, fire safety measures, and accessibility standards. Immediate attention is required to address these deficiencies.

**7. Conclusion**

This inspection reveals that while the 1970 manufacturing facility in Sonkajärvi retains structural integrity overall, significant updates are necessary across various systems to ensure safety, efficiency, and legal compliance. It is recommended that the owner engage qualified professionals for detailed assessments and subsequent remediation efforts.
