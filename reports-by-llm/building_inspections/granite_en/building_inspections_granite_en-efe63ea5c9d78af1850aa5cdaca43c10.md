**1. General Information**

- Country: Finland
- Municipality: Uurainen
- Address: Kauppakatu 23, 80100 Joensuu (Invented for reporting purposes)
- Inspection Date: 17.10.2024
- Inspector Name: Jari Pekkarinen

**2. Building Overview**

- Type: Residential
- Construction Year: 2018
- Number of Floors: Two-story building with a semi-basement for utility areas
- Primary Materials: Reinforced concrete frame, timber framing for interior walls, exterior cladding in natural wood shingles, triple-glazed windows for energy efficiency.

**3. Inspection Context**

- Weather Conditions: The inspection was conducted under partly cloudy skies with a temperature of 8Â°C and moderate winds typical for the autumn season in Uurainen, Finland.
- Purpose of Inspection: Routine annual building maintenance check.

**4. Observations and Findings**

*Structural:*  
The structural integrity of the building appears sound with no visible signs of settlement or distress. The reinforced concrete frame meets contemporary standards for residential construction in Finland, ensuring adequate load-bearing capacity.

*Electrical:*  
The electrical system is generally compliant with current regulations. However, minor discrepancies were noted in ground fault circuit interrupter (GFCI) placements near water sources in bathrooms and kitchen areas, which should be corrected to ensure safety against electric shock.

*Plumbing:*  
Plumbing fixtures are in good working order with no leaks identified during the inspection. The water supply lines appear to be in copper, a common material in newer Finnish residential construction, and are properly insulated to prevent freezing in colder months.

*HVAC:*  
The heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system functions efficiently. The heat pump unit shows signs of regular maintenance and is appropriately sized for the building's needs. Ductwork insulation could be improved to enhance energy efficiency further.

*Fire Safety:*  
Smoke detectors are installed on each floor as required by Finnish fire safety regulations. However, there is a lack of sprinkler systems, which, while not mandatory in all residential buildings in Finland, would be recommended for enhanced safety.

*Accessibility:*  
The building demonstrates some accessibility features such as ramp access to the entrance and wide doorways. Nonetheless, improvements could be made, particularly in bathroom modifications to accommodate individuals with mobility challenges more fully.

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

- Correct GFCI placements in wet areas to meet safety standards.
- Consider installing a sprinkler system for enhanced fire protection.
- Improve ductwork insulation in the HVAC system for better energy efficiency.
- Enhance accessibility features, especially in bathrooms, to fully comply with Finnish accessibility codes.

**6. Compliance Summary**

The building generally complies with current Finnish residential construction standards and regulations. However, there are areas where improvements can be made to align more closely with best practices and ensure safety and efficiency.

**7. Conclusion**

Upon completion of the routine inspection on 17.10.2024, the residential building at Kauppakatu 23, Joensuu, Uurainen, Finland, was found to be structurally sound with minor deviations from optimal compliance in electrical safety, fire protection, and accessibility features. It is recommended that the property owner address the identified issues promptly to ensure adherence to Finnish building codes and enhance overall safety and efficiency.
