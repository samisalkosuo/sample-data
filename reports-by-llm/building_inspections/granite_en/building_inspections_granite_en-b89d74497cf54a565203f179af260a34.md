*Structural:*  
The building's structural integrity appears sound with no visible signs of distress or settlement. The reinforced concrete foundation and framing are in good condition, consistent with the 2011 construction era.

*Electrical:*  
The electrical system is generally compliant but requires updating to meet current safety standards. Some non-compliant outlets and wiring were identified, particularly in older sections of the building.

*Plumbing:*  
Plumbing fixtures are in fair condition with minor leaks noted in the basement area, likely due to age and wear. Water supply lines show signs of corrosion, suggesting potential for future issues.

*HVAC:*  
Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems function adequately but are nearing the end of their expected lifespan. Regular maintenance and possible component replacements are recommended.

*Fire Safety:*  
The fire alarm system is present and operational; however, smoke detectors in less accessible areas require testing and potential relocation for optimal coverage. Fire extinguishers were found to be expired and need immediate replacement.

*Accessibility:*  
The building has ramp access but lacks adequate signage indicating wheelchair routes. The entrance threshold does not meet current accessibility standards, posing a barrier for individuals with mobility impairments.

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

- Update electrical systems to comply with Finnish safety regulations (FS 3201:2020).
- Replace expired fire extinguishers and ensure regular testing of smoke detectors, especially in less accessible areas.
- Address plumbing corrosion issues proactively to prevent leaks and water damage.
- Plan for HVAC system maintenance or replacement to ensure efficient and safe operation.
- Improve accessibility by installing clear signage for wheelchair routes and adjusting entrance thresholds to meet current standards.

**6. Compliance Summary**

The building generally complies with Finnish Building Code (Laki häiritystöihmisäädintöön, 2019) but falls short in specific areas such as electrical safety, fire safety equipment maintenance, and accessibility standards. Immediate attention to these issues is advised to ensure ongoing compliance and occupant safety.

**7. Conclusion**

Upon completion of the routine inspection on 08.05.2025, the commercial property at Kauppakatu 23 in Rantasalmi, Finland, was found to be structurally sound with minor areas requiring attention. Immediate and planned maintenance are recommended to address electrical, plumbing, HVAC, fire safety, and accessibility concerns.
