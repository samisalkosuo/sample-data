- Municipality: Harjavalta
- Address: Kauppakatu 23, 37800 Harjavalta, Finland
- Inspection Date: 12.01.2025 (DD.MM.YYYY format)
- Inspector Name: Jari Pietilä

**2. Building Overview**

- Type: Public (Community Center)
- Construction Year: 2017
- Number of Floors: Two-story building with a basement level
- Primary Materials: Reinforced concrete structure, timber framing, and exterior cladding in Finnish pine

**3. Inspection Context**

- Weather Conditions: The inspection was conducted under clear, cold conditions typical for early January in Harjavalta, Finland, with a temperature of -8°C and minimal precipitation.
- Purpose of Inspection: Routine safety and compliance check

**4. Observations and Findings**

*Structural:*  
The building's structural integrity appears sound, with no visible signs of distress or settlement. The reinforced concrete foundation and framing meet contemporary standards for residential and public buildings in Finland.

*Electrical:*  
The electrical system is generally compliant but requires updating to current safety codes. Some outlets lack ground-fault circuit interrupters (GFCIs), particularly in wet areas like the basement.

*Plumbing:*  
Plumbing fixtures are in good condition, with no leaks or signs of corrosion. However, the water heating system shows minor scale buildup, suggesting periodic maintenance is advisable.

*HVAC:*  
The heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system functions adequately but could benefit from an energy audit to optimize efficiency and reduce operational costs.

*Fire Safety:*  
Smoke detectors are present on each floor, but battery backups need replacement. Fire extinguishers are located appropriately, though some require servicing.

*Accessibility:*  
The building has ramp access for wheelchair users and accessible restrooms, complying with Finnish accessibility standards for public buildings constructed post-2015.

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

- **Electrical:** Upgrade electrical outlets to include GFCIs in all wet areas, especially the basement.
- **Plumbing:** Schedule a professional cleaning of water heaters to remove scale buildup.
- **HVAC:** Conduct an energy audit to assess efficiency improvements and potential cost savings.
- **Fire Safety:** Replace batteries in smoke detectors and service fire extinguishers.

**6. Compliance Summary**

The building generally complies with Finnish building regulations, notably the Building Control Act (Tietöiden hallinto) and the Safety in Mind Act (Turvallisuusvaroituksen mukainen käsittelymenettely). However, some areas require immediate attention to meet current safety standards.

**7. Conclusion**

The Harjavalta Community Center, constructed in 2017, demonstrates satisfactory adherence to contemporary Finnish building practices. While the structure is sound and meets many regulatory requirements, specific updates are recommended for electrical safety, plumbing maintenance, HVAC efficiency, and fire safety measures.
