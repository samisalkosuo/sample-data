**Official Building Inspection Report**

**1. General Information**

- Country: Finland
- Municipality: Ilomantsi
- Address: Kauppakatu 12, 80100 Ilomantsi, Finland
- Inspection Date: 23.06.2025 (DD.MM.YYYY)
- Inspector Name: Jari P. Lehtinen

**2. Building Overview**

- Type: Industrial
- Construction Year: 1981
- Number of Floors: Two-story structure
- Primary Materials: Reinforced concrete and timber construction, typical for industrial buildings in Finland during the early 1980s.

**3. Inspection Context**

- Weather Conditions: On the inspection date, the weather was partly cloudy with temperatures around 15°C (59°F), consistent with late June in northern Finland.
- Purpose of Inspection: Routine safety and compliance check.

**4. Observations and Findings**

*Structural:*  
The building's structural integrity appears sound, with reinforced concrete framing showing minimal signs of deterioration. Some minor cracking in the concrete is noted but deemed non-critical at this stage.

*Electrical:*  
The electrical system includes outdated wiring that requires upgrading to meet current safety standards. The panelboard shows signs of overloading, necessitating a reconfiguration or upgrade.

*Plumbing:*  
Plumbing fixtures are functional but show evidence of corrosion in older metallic pipes. Recommend replacement to prevent leaks and potential contamination.

*HVAC:*  
The heating system (oil-fired boiler) is operational but inefficient. Suggest exploring modern, energy-saving alternatives like heat pumps for compliance with current energy efficiency regulations.

*Fire Safety:*  
Smoke detectors are present but may need battery replacement and possibly an upgrade to interconnected systems for improved response. Fire extinguishers were found and appear serviceable.

*Accessibility:*  
The building lacks modern accessibility features such as ramps or elevators, which are required under current Finnish building codes for public industrial spaces.

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

- **Electrical System:** Upgrade wiring to comply with current standards; consider reconfiguring the panelboard to prevent overloading.
- **Plumbing:** Replace corroded metallic pipes to avoid leaks and ensure water quality.
- **HVAC:** Evaluate and install an energy-efficient heating solution, such as a heat pump, to meet contemporary efficiency requirements.
- **Fire Safety:** Update smoke detectors to interconnected systems; assess the need for additional fire safety measures like sprinklers if usage patterns change.
- **Accessibility:** Install ramps and consider elevator installation or other accessibility improvements to comply with current regulations.

**6. Compliance Summary**

The building partially complies with current Finnish building codes, particularly in structural integrity. However, significant non-compliance exists regarding electrical systems, plumbing, HVAC efficiency, fire safety equipment, and accessibility features. Immediate attention to these areas is advised for full regulatory compliance.

**7. Conclusion**

The industrial building at Kauppakatu 12, Ilomantsi, exhibits a generally sound structural condition but requires substantial modernization across various systems to meet present-day safety and efficiency standards. It is recommended that the owner address the identified issues promptly to ensure compliance with Finnish building regulations and enhance overall safety and functionality.
