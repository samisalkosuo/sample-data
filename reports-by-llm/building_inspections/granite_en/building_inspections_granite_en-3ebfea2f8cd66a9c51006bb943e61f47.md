**Official Building Inspection Report**

**1. General Information**

- Country: Finland
- Municipality: Uusikaupunki
- Address: Kaupunkintie 123, 28100 Uusikaupunki, Finland
- Inspection Date: 20.09.2024 (DD.MM.YYYY)
- Inspector Name: Jari Pekkarinen

**2. Building Overview**

- Type: Industrial
- Construction Year: 1984
- Number of Floors: Two-story structure
- Primary Materials: Reinforced concrete frame with timber flooring and metal cladding

**3. Inspection Context**

Weather conditions on the inspection date were mild, with temperatures around 15°C and light rainfall typical for the autumn season in Uusikaupunki. The purpose of this routine inspection was to evaluate the structural integrity and compliance with current building standards for potential renovation projects.

**4. Observations and Findings**

- **Structural**: The reinforced concrete frame shows signs of minor cracking, consistent with age and typical weather exposure in Finland's coastal climate. No immediate concerns for load-bearing capacity were identified.
- **Electrical**: Wiring appears outdated; non-compliant with current safety standards. Some circuits show overheating risks due to insufficient amperage.
- **Plumbing**: Galvanized steel pipes exhibit signs of corrosion, potentially leading to reduced water flow and increased risk of leaks. Recommend replacement with modern materials like PVC or copper.
- **HVAC**: The heating system (oil-fired boiler) is functional but inefficient. Suggest upgrading to a more energy-efficient solution, such as a heat pump, for compliance with Finnish energy regulations.
- **Fire Safety**: Fire alarm system is present but lacks modern sensors and integration with fire suppression systems. Upgrade recommended for improved safety standards.
- **Accessibility**: The building does not meet current accessibility requirements due to lack of ramps and insufficient door widths, necessitating modifications to comply with Finnish Accessibility Act (Laki käytössäädintulehdus 2018).

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

- **Electrical**: Upgrade wiring to meet current safety standards; install modern circuit breakers and ground fault protection.
- **Plumbing**: Replace corroded steel pipes with compliant materials; inspect for lead content if present in older installations.
- **HVAC**: Replace oil-fired boiler with an energy-efficient heat pump system to reduce carbon footprint and operational costs.
- **Fire Safety**: Install a modern fire alarm system integrated with automatic fire suppression, ensuring compliance with Finnish safety regulations (e.g., TS 1345).
- **Accessibility**: Modify entrances with ramps; widen doorways to meet the Accessibility Act requirements.

**6. Compliance Summary**

The building partially complies with current Finnish building codes and accessibility standards. Significant updates are required in electrical, plumbing, HVAC systems, fire safety measures, and accessibility features to ensure full compliance.

**7. Conclusion**

Upon completion of the inspection on 20.09.2024, several areas require attention to meet contemporary standards and regulations. Immediate action is recommended for electrical, plumbing, HVAC upgrades, fire safety improvements, and accessibility modifications. Further detailed engineering assessments may be necessary for specific recommendations.
