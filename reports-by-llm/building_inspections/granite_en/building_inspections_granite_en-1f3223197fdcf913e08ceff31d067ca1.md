**4. Observations and Findings**

*Structural:*  
The building's structural integrity appears sound with minimal signs of settlement or distress. The reinforced concrete frame exhibits standard cracking consistent with age, posing no immediate concern.

*Electrical:*  
The electrical system shows some outdated components, including non-grounded outlets and wiring that does not meet current safety standards. There are signs of potential overloading in certain circuits.

*Plumbing:*  
Plumbing fixtures are generally functional but show evidence of corrosion, particularly in older galvanized steel pipes. Some leaks have been identified which require attention to prevent water damage.

*HVAC:*  
The heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system is operational but inefficient. The age of the system suggests it may not comply with current energy-saving regulations.

*Fire Safety:*  
Smoke detectors are present on each floor but require battery replacement. Fire extinguishers are located but some show signs of expired service dates. Emergency exits are clearly marked, though one exit door's lock mechanism is malfunctioning.

*Accessibility:*  
The building lacks ramp access for individuals with mobility impairments, failing to meet current accessibility standards. There is no elevator, limiting access to upper floors.

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

- **Electrical:** Upgrade electrical system to include grounded outlets and modern wiring to ensure safety and compliance.
- **Plumbing:** Replace corroded pipes to prevent leaks and water damage. Conduct a full plumbing inspection to address any hidden issues.
- **HVAC:** Evaluate the efficiency of the HVAC system; consider upgrading to a more energy-efficient model to meet contemporary standards.
- **Fire Safety:** Replace expired fire extinguishers, service all smoke detectors, and repair the malfunctioning exit door lock.
- **Accessibility:** Install ramp access and evaluate the feasibility of installing an elevator to comply with accessibility regulations.

**6. Compliance Summary**

The building demonstrates compliance with foundational structural requirements but falls short in several areas related to electrical safety, plumbing integrity, HVAC efficiency, fire safety measures, and accessibility standards. Immediate attention is required for non-compliant aspects to ensure the building meets current Finnish regulations.

**7. Conclusion**

This inspection reveals that while the structural framework of Kauppakatu 12 remains sound, various systems and features require updating to meet contemporary standards and legal requirements. It is recommended that the property owner address the identified issues promptly to ensure safety, efficiency, and compliance with Finnish building codes.
