**Official Building Inspection Report**

**1. General Information**

- **Country:** Finland
- **Municipality:** Pornainen
- **Address:** Kauppakatu 12, 94800 Pornainen, Finland (Invented for reporting purposes)
- **Inspection Date:** 27.02.2025 (DD.MM.YYYY format)
- **Inspector Name:** Marko Hietala

**2. Building Overview**

- **Type:** Residential
- **Construction Year:** 1977
- **Number of Floors:** Two-story building with a basement level
- **Primary Materials:** Reinforced concrete frame, timber framing for interior walls, wooden roof construction clad with asphalt shingles, and exterior walls finished with stucco over a brick veneer.

**3. Inspection Context**

- **Weather Conditions:** On the inspection date, clear weather conditions prevailed with temperatures around -10Â°C. Snow cover was present, typical for late February in Pornainen, Finland.
- **Purpose of Inspection:** Routine annual building safety check.

**4. Observations and Findings**

*Structural:*  
The structural frame appears sound with minimal signs of settlement. The reinforced concrete elements show minor cracking, consistent with age and climate conditions. No immediate concerns for structural integrity were identified.

*Electrical:*  
The electrical system is outdated, featuring ungrounded two-prong outlets and a fuse box instead of modern circuit breakers. Wiring insulation shows signs of deterioration in some areas, posing potential fire hazards.

*Plumbing:*  
Galvanized steel pipes are present throughout the plumbing system, exhibiting rust and reduced water flow in several sections. Evidence of past leaks suggests potential corrosion issues.

*HVAC:*  
The heating system, a gas-fired boiler with radiators, functions but shows signs of inefficiency and could benefit from modernization for better energy performance. Ductwork insulation is absent or incomplete, leading to heat loss.

*Fire Safety:*  
Smoke detectors are installed on each floor but appear to be older models potentially nearing end-of-life. The presence of a single fire extinguisher is inadequate for the building size and type.

*Accessibility:*  
The building lacks modern accessibility features such as ramps or elevators, posing challenges for individuals with mobility impairments. Staircases do not meet current accessibility standards.

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

- **Electrical:** Upgrade electrical system to comply with current safety standards, including ground-fault circuit interrupters (GFCIs) and replacement of outdated wiring.
- **Plumbing:** Replace corroded galvanized steel pipes with modern materials like PEX or copper to ensure reliable water supply and prevent future leaks.
- **HVAC:** Consider replacing the inefficient boiler with a high-efficiency model and improving ductwork insulation for better energy performance.
- **Fire Safety:** Install interconnected smoke detectors throughout, including on each floor and in sleeping areas, and provide additional fire safety equipment such as a fire blanket and an easily accessible fire extinguisher.
- **Accessibility:** Evaluate options for installing ramps or an elevator to meet current accessibility standards, ensuring compliance with the Accessibility Act (Finland).

**6. Compliance Summary**

The building generally complies with structural integrity requirements but falls short in several critical areas including electrical safety, plumbing, HVAC efficiency, fire safety measures, and accessibility. While the core structure is sound for its age, significant upgrades are necessary to meet contemporary Finnish building codes and safety standards.

**7. Conclusion**

This residential property in Pornainen requires comprehensive modernization to ensure compliance with current Finnish building regulations and enhance safety and efficiency. Immediate attention is recommended for electrical, plumbing, HVAC systems, fire safety improvements, and accessibility modifications.
