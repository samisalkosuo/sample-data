**Official Building Inspection Report**

**1. General Information**

- Country: Finland  
- Municipality: Siikalatva  
- Address: Kauppakatu 23, 40100 Siikalatva, Finland  
- Inspection Date: 23.03.2025  
- Inspector Name: Marko Pietilä

**2. Building Overview**

- Type: Industrial  
- Construction Year: 2016  
- Number of Floors: 2 (ground floor and mezzanine level)  
- Primary Materials: Reinforced concrete structure, timber framing, metal cladding, triple-glazed windows

**3. Inspection Context**

- Weather Conditions: The inspection was conducted under partly cloudy skies with a temperature of 5°C and moderate winds, typical for the transitional period between winter and spring in Siikalatva.  
- Purpose of Inspection: Routine safety and compliance check

**4. Observations and Findings**

*Structural:*  
The building's structural integrity appears sound with no visible signs of distress or settlement. The reinforced concrete frame meets current Finnish standards for industrial buildings, including adequate deflection limits and crack widths.

*Electrical:*  
The electrical system is generally compliant but requires updating to meet the latest Finnish safety codes (FS 3101:2020). Specifically, ground-fault circuit interrupters (GFCIs) should be installed in wet areas, and some outdated wiring needs replacement.

*Plumbing:*  
Plumbing fixtures are functional but show minor signs of corrosion, particularly in the steel pipes. Recommend replacing sections prone to leaks to prevent future water damage.

*HVAC:*  
Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems are operational but less energy-efficient than modern standards suggest. Insulation quality is adequate; however, upgrading to more efficient units could reduce utility costs.

*Fire Safety:*  
The fire alarm system is present and tested, meeting Finnish safety regulations (FS 1234:2018). Fire extinguishers are appropriately located but require inspection and possible replacement due to expiration dates nearing.

*Accessibility:*  
The building has ramp access for wheelchair users, complying with the Accessibility Act (629/1999). However, doorway thresholds need adjusting to ensure smooth transitions.

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

- Update electrical systems to meet FS 3101:2020 standards, particularly installing GFCIs in wet areas and replacing outdated wiring.
- Replace corroded sections of plumbing with new materials to prevent leaks.
- Upgrade HVAC units to more energy-efficient models to reduce operational costs and improve environmental performance.
- Inspect and replace fire extinguishers nearing expiration dates.
- Adjust doorway thresholds for seamless accessibility compliance.

**6. Compliance Summary**

The building generally complies with Finnish industrial construction codes, notably FS 3100 series for structural requirements and FS 1200 for fire safety. However, certain systems (electrical, plumbing, HVAC) require updates to meet current standards and regulations.

**7. Conclusion**

The industrial building at Kauppakatu 23 demonstrates satisfactory structural integrity but requires attention to several areas for compliance and efficiency improvements. It is recommended that the owner address the noted electrical, plumbing, HVAC, fire safety, and accessibility issues promptly to ensure ongoing safety and regulatory adherence.
