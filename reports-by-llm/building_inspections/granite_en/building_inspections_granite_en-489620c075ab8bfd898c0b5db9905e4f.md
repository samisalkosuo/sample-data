**Official Building Inspection Report**

**1. General Information**

- **Country:** Finland
- **Municipality:** Salla
- **Address:** Kaupunkintie 123, 99800 Salla, Finland
- **Inspection Date:** 14.10.2024 (DD.MM.YYYY)
- **Inspector Name:** Jari Pekkarinen

**2. Building Overview**

- **Type:** Public - Community Center
- **Construction Year:** 1995
- **Number of Floors:** Two-story building with a basement level
- **Primary Materials:** Reinforced concrete structure, timber framing, and wooden cladding typical for Finnish construction in the mid-1990s.

**3. Inspection Context**

- **Weather Conditions:** Clear skies with temperature at 5Â°C, suitable for an October inspection in northern Finland.
- **Purpose of Inspection:** Routine annual safety and compliance check.

**4. Observations and Findings**

*Structural:*  
The building's foundation appears sound, with no visible cracks or settlement issues. The reinforced concrete structure meets contemporary standards for load-bearing capacity.

*Electrical:*  
Wiring is mostly original but shows signs of aging. Some non-metallic sheathed cables exhibit deterioration; recommendations include partial rewiring to meet current safety codes.

*Plumbing:*  
Plumbing system functions adequately, though there are minor leaks in the basement that require attention to prevent water damage and mold growth.

*HVAC:*  
Heating system (district heating connection) is operational but could benefit from an efficiency audit to reduce energy consumption. Cooling system (window units) is basic and may need upgrading for improved comfort.

*Fire Safety:*  
Smoke detectors are present on each floor, but battery backups are missing in some; these should be installed immediately. Fire extinguishers are located appropriately but require periodic maintenance checks.

*Accessibility:*  
The building has ramp access to all main entrances, complying with ADA standards. However, interior accessibility needs improvement, particularly in bathrooms and meeting rooms.

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

- **Electrical:** Replace approximately 30% of non-metallic sheathed cables with modern alternatives to ensure safety and compliance.
- **Plumbing:** Address leaks in the basement, focusing on preventive maintenance to avoid future issues.
- **HVAC:** Conduct an energy audit for heating systems and consider upgrading cooling solutions for better efficiency and occupant comfort.
- **Fire Safety:** Install battery backups for smoke detectors across all floors and schedule regular maintenance checks for fire extinguishers.
- **Accessibility:** Upgrade interior accessibility features, especially in high-use areas like bathrooms and meeting rooms, to fully comply with current standards.

**6. Compliance Summary**

The building generally complies with Finnish Building Code (Tiedotuslaki) and local regulations, notably in structural integrity and fire safety provisions. However, several areas fall short of current standards, primarily concerning electrical systems, plumbing maintenance, HVAC efficiency, and full accessibility compliance.

**7. Conclusion**

The Salla Community Center, constructed in 1995, demonstrates a solid structural foundation but requires attention to various aspects to maintain safety and compliance with modern standards. Immediate actions are recommended for electrical rewiring, plumbing maintenance, HVAC efficiency improvements, fire safety enhancements, and full accessibility upgrades.
