**Official Building Inspection Report**

**1. General Information**

- Country: Finland
- Municipality: Nakkila
- Address: Kauppakatu 12, 67100 Nakkila, Finland
- Inspection Date: 14.07.2025
- Inspector Name: Jari P. Lehtinen

**2. Building Overview**

- Type: Industrial (Manufacturing Facility)
- Construction Year: 2010
- Number of Floors: Two-story structure
- Primary Materials: Reinforced concrete frame with timber cladding, double-glazed windows, and metal roofing

**3. Inspection Context**

- Weather Conditions: Clear skies with a temperature of 18°C and moderate humidity, typical for the late summer in Finland. The inspection was conducted as part of a routine annual check.

**4. Observations and Findings**

*Structural:*  
The building's structural integrity appears sound with no visible signs of distress or settlement. Reinforced concrete elements show minor surface cracking, consistent with the age and typical behavior of such materials in Finland’s climate.

*Electrical:*  
Wiring is generally well-maintained, though some older sections could benefit from inspection to ensure compliance with current safety standards. Lighting fixtures are adequate for industrial use.

*Plumbing:*  
Plumbing systems show signs of minor corrosion in older pipes but are functional. Recommend replacement of high-risk sections to prevent future leaks or contamination.

*HVAC:*  
Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems are operational. The heat exchanger shows some wear; maintenance is advised to optimize efficiency and extend lifespan.

*Fire Safety:*  
Fire alarm system is present and tested during the inspection. Fire extinguishers are adequately placed but require recharging or replacement as per manufacturer guidelines. Emergency exits are clear and accessible, though signage could be updated for clarity.

*Accessibility:*  
The building provides ramp access for wheelchair users, complying with basic accessibility standards. However, further improvements in lighting and tactile guidance within the facility would enhance compliance with modern accessibility codes.

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

- **Structural:** Schedule a detailed structural engineering assessment to monitor cracking and ensure long-term stability.
- **Electrical:** Engage a certified electrician for an inspection and potential upgrade of electrical systems to meet current safety standards.
- **Plumbing:** Replace corroded sections of plumbing to prevent future leaks and water quality issues.
- **HVAC:** Arrange maintenance for the HVAC system, including cleaning and efficiency checks, to ensure optimal performance and energy use.
- **Fire Safety:** Update fire safety equipment (extinguishers) and review emergency exit signage for compliance with current regulations.
- **Accessibility:** Improve lighting and tactile guidance within the facility to fully meet contemporary accessibility standards.

**6. Compliance Summary**

The building generally complies with Finnish industrial construction codes, notably in structural integrity and fire safety measures. However, several areas require attention to align with current safety, efficiency, and accessibility standards.

**7. Conclusion**

Upon completion of the inspection on 14.07.2025, the manufacturing facility in Nakkila demonstrates satisfactory overall condition but necessitates targeted maintenance and upgrades to ensure ongoing compliance and operational efficiency. Immediate actions are recommended for electrical, plumbing, HVAC systems, fire safety equipment, and accessibility enhancements.
