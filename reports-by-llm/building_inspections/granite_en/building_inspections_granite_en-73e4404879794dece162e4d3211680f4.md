**4. Observations and Findings**

*Structural:*  
- Foundation and load-bearing walls appear sound, with minor cracking observed, consistent with age and climate conditions.  
- Roof structure shows signs of wear but remains adequately supported.

*Electrical:*  
- Wiring is outdated; non-compliant with current safety standards. Requires complete replacement to meet modern electrical codes.

*Plumbing:*  
- Plumbing system functional, though some pipes exhibit signs of corrosion, necessitating inspection and potential replacement.

*HVAC:*  
- Heating system operational but inefficient; consideration for upgrade to more energy-effective models recommended.

*Fire Safety:*  
- Fire alarm system present and tested, compliant with current regulations.  
- Fire exits clear but some signs faded, suggesting replacement or repainting is needed.

*Accessibility:*  
- Building has ramp access for wheelchair users, though handrails on one ramp are loose and require tightening or replacement.

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

1. **Electrical System:** Replace all wiring to meet current safety standards immediately. Schedule an electrician specializing in historical building retrofits.
2. **Plumbing:** Inspect and replace corroded pipes to prevent leaks and water damage. Engage a plumber experienced with older systems.
3. **HVAC Upgrade:** Evaluate energy-efficient heating options (e.g., heat pumps) to reduce operational costs and environmental impact. Consult an HVAC specialist for feasibility study.
4. **Fire Safety Signage:** Replace faded fire exit signs with new, compliant signage to ensure clear visibility in emergencies.
5. **Accessibility Improvements:** Secure loose handrails on ramps and consider additional accessibility enhancements such as automatic doors where applicable.

**6. Compliance Summary**

The building generally complies with current Finnish Building Code (Hakuohje) regarding structural integrity and fire safety measures. However, significant non-compliance is noted in electrical systems and plumbing, necessitating immediate attention to ensure safety and legal adherence. Recommend consultation with local building authorities for a detailed compliance assessment post-remediation.

**7. Conclusion**

The Rautjärvi Community Center, constructed in 1988, requires comprehensive modernization of its electrical and plumbing systems to meet contemporary safety standards. While structural elements are sound, the aging infrastructure poses risks that must be addressed promptly for public safety and regulatory compliance. It is recommended that the municipality engage qualified contractors specializing in retrofitting historical buildings to execute necessary upgrades.
