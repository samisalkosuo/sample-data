**Official Building Inspection Report**

**1. General Information**

- Country: Finland
- Municipality: Liminka
- Address: Kauppakatu 23, 80100 Liminka, Finland
- Inspection Date: 21.12.2024
- Inspector Name: Jari P. Lehtinen

**2. Building Overview**

- Type: Commercial (Retail Store)
- Construction Year: 1995
- Number of Floors: Two-story building with a basement level
- Primary Materials: Reinforced concrete structure, brick façade, and timber roof construction common for the era

**3. Inspection Context**

- Weather Conditions: The inspection was conducted under partly cloudy skies with temperatures at -5°C, typical for early winter in Liminka. Snow cover was present on the ground.
- Purpose of Inspection: Routine annual compliance check

**4. Observations and Findings**

*Structural:*  
The building's structural elements appear sound, with no immediate signs of distress or deformation. The reinforced concrete columns and beams show standard wear consistent with a 29-year-old structure.

*Electrical:*  
The electrical system is outdated, featuring aluminum wiring which may require replacement to meet current safety standards. Circuit breakers are present but some panels show signs of overheating, necessitating an upgrade.

*Plumbing:*  
Plumbing fixtures are generally functional, though some pipes exhibit corrosion indicative of their age. Recommend inspection and potential replacement of galvanized steel pipes to prevent future leaks or water quality issues.

*HVAC:*  
Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems are operational but inefficient. The old heating system (oil-fired boiler) should be evaluated for modernization to reduce energy consumption and emissions.

*Fire Safety:*  
Smoke detectors are installed according to code, but the fire alarm system lacks integration with emergency lighting. Recommend upgrading to a comprehensive fire safety system including sprinklers where feasible.

*Accessibility:*  
The building has ramp access for wheelchair users, complying with basic accessibility standards. However, interior doorways are narrower than current ADA guidelines recommend, suggesting modifications for full compliance.

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

- **Electrical:** Replace aluminum wiring with copper to mitigate fire risk and improve efficiency. Upgrade circuit breaker panels to modern standards.
- **Plumbing:** Inspect and replace corroded galvanized steel pipes to prevent leaks and ensure water quality.
- **HVAC:** Evaluate replacement or retrofit of the heating system to a more energy-efficient model (e.g., heat pump).
- **Fire Safety:** Install an integrated fire alarm and emergency lighting system for comprehensive safety.
- **Accessibility:** Widen interior doorways to meet current accessibility standards.

**6. Compliance Summary**

The building generally complies with Finnish Building Code (Tiedotuslaki) regarding structural integrity, electrical grounding, and plumbing fixtures. However, several areas fall short of current safety and efficiency standards, particularly in electrical systems, HVAC, fire safety, and accessibility features.

**7. Conclusion**

The commercial property at Kauppakatu 23 demonstrates a mix of satisfactory and outdated features typical for its construction era. While the structural framework remains sound, significant upgrades are recommended to meet contemporary safety, energy efficiency, and accessibility requirements.
