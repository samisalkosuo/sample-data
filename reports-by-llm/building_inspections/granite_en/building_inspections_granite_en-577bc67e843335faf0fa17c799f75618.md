- **Address:** Kauppakatu 12, 80100 Masku, Finland (Invented for reporting purposes)
- **Inspection Date:** 07.12.2024 (DD.MM.YYYY format)
- **Inspector Name:** Jari P. Lehtinen

**2. Building Overview**

- **Type:** Public (Community Center)
- **Construction Year:** 1974
- **Number of Floors:** Two-story building with a basement level
- **Primary Materials:** Reinforced concrete structure, brick facade, timber framing for interior partitions

**3. Inspection Context**

- **Weather Conditions on Inspection Date:** Cold and overcast, temperature approximately -5Â°C, light snowfall observed.
- **Purpose of Inspection:** Routine safety and compliance check prior to winter maintenance.

**4. Observations and Findings**

*Structural:*  
The building's structural elements appear sound with minimal signs of deterioration. The reinforced concrete foundation and load-bearing walls show adequate integrity. Some minor cracking is noted in the basement walls, likely due to settlement, but does not pose immediate risk.

*Electrical:*  
The electrical system includes outdated wiring that requires upgrading for safety compliance. The panelboard shows signs of corrosion and overheating, necessitating replacement. Ground-fault circuit interrupters (GFCIs) are absent in areas prone to moisture, such as kitchens and bathrooms.

*Plumbing:*  
Plumbing fixtures are generally functional but exhibit signs of age-related wear. Galvanized steel pipes show evidence of corrosion, increasing the risk of leaks and reduced water flow. Recommend replacement with modern materials like PEX or copper.

*HVAC:*  
The heating system, a vintage oil-fired boiler, is operational but inefficient and non-compliant with current energy standards. Consider upgrading to a high-efficiency heat pump for better performance and cost savings.

*Fire Safety:*  
Smoke detectors are present on each floor but require battery replacement and interconnectivity for comprehensive coverage. Fire extinguishers are located but some appear expired, necessitating immediate replacement. Emergency lighting is functional but insufficient in magnitude for adequate illumination during emergencies.

*Accessibility:*  
The building lacks ramp access for individuals with mobility impairments, failing to meet current accessibility standards. Installation of ramps and ensuring door thresholds are compliant with ADA-like regulations is recommended.

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

1. Upgrade electrical system, including wiring replacement, installation of GFCIs, and panelboard modernization.
2. Replace corroded plumbing pipes to prevent future leaks and ensure water quality.
3. Install a high-efficiency HVAC system to meet energy standards and reduce operational costs.
4. Enhance fire safety measures by updating smoke detectors, ensuring all fire extinguishers are serviceable, and improving emergency lighting.
5. Modify the building to ensure compliance with accessibility regulations, including ramp installation and threshold adjustments.

**6. Compliance Summary**

The building demonstrates partial compliance with current Finnish building codes, particularly concerning electrical safety, plumbing integrity, fire protection, HVAC efficiency, and accessibility standards. Immediate attention to the identified issues is advised to ensure full regulatory compliance and occupant safety.

**7. Conclusion**

Upon completion of this routine inspection on 07.12.2024, by Inspector Jari P. Lehtinen, it is evident that while the structural integrity of Kauppakatu 12 in Masku remains satisfactory, several critical areas require urgent attention to meet contemporary safety and accessibility standards. Immediate action on electrical, plumbing, HVAC systems, fire safety enhancements, and accessibility modifications is recommended for the building's continued safe and compliant operation.
