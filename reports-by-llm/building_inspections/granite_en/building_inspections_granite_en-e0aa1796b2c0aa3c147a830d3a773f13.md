**Official Building Inspection Report**

**1. General Information**

- Country: Finland  
- Municipality: Lahti  
- Address: Kauppakatu 23, 15100 Lahti, Finland  
- Inspection Date: 17.11.2024  
- Inspector Name: Jari Pekkarinen

**2. Building Overview**

- Type: Residential  
- Construction Year: 1994  
- Number of Floors: Two (ground floor and first floor)  
- Primary Materials: Reinforced concrete structure with timber framing, exterior clad in weatherboard, roof covered with asphalt shingles.

**3. Inspection Context**

- Weather Conditions: The inspection was conducted under partly cloudy skies with a temperature of 2°C and light winds, typical for the late autumn season in Lahti, Finland.  
- Purpose of Inspection: Routine annual check as per local municipal regulations.

**4. Observations and Findings**

*Structural:*  
The building's structural integrity appears sound with minimal signs of settlement or distress. The reinforced concrete foundation and timber framing show consistent wear but no immediate concerns.

*Electrical:*  
The electrical system is outdated, featuring a mix of old wiring and some newer installations. There are instances of ungrounded outlets and inadequate circuit protection, posing potential safety hazards.

*Plumbing:*  
Plumbing fixtures are generally functional but show signs of corrosion, particularly in older galvanized steel pipes. Water pressure is within acceptable limits, though some faucets exhibit reduced flow due to mineral buildup.

*HVAC:*  
The heating system, a gas-fired boiler with radiator-based distribution, operates efficiently but lacks modern insulation around supply and return ducts, leading to heat loss. The air conditioning unit is non-functional and should be replaced or repaired.

*Fire Safety:*  
Smoke detectors are present on each floor but require battery replacement. There is a lack of sprinkler systems and fire alarms in critical areas such as kitchens and stairwells, which are mandatory under current Finnish building codes for residential buildings constructed after 2005.

*Accessibility:*  
The property has limited accessibility features, with no ramps or elevators present, making it challenging for individuals with mobility impairments to navigate the premises.

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

- **Electrical:** Upgrade electrical wiring to meet current safety standards, install ground fault circuit interrupters (GFCIs) in wet areas, and ensure all outlets are grounded.  
- **Plumbing:** Replace corroded sections of plumbing with modern materials like PEX or copper to prevent leaks and improve water quality.  
- **HVAC:** Insulate ductwork and consider upgrading the heating system to a more energy-efficient model, possibly integrating zoned heating for better control and savings.  
- **Fire Safety:** Install a modern fire alarm system connected to a monitoring service, add sprinklers in critical areas, and ensure all smoke detectors are battery-powered with test functionality.  
- **Accessibility:** Evaluate the feasibility of installing ramps and consider modifications to improve accessibility for individuals with disabilities, ensuring compliance with Finnish accessibility laws.

**6. Compliance Summary**

The building generally complies with structural integrity requirements but falls short in several key areas related to electrical safety, plumbing, HVAC efficiency, fire protection, and accessibility standards as per the Finnish Building Code (Hakuohje) and Accessibility Act (Laki käytössuojelusuhdessa).

**7. Conclusion**

This residential property in Lahti requires attention to several critical areas to ensure safety, efficiency, and legal compliance. Immediate actions are recommended for electrical and plumbing upgrades, while long-term planning should address HVAC improvements and accessibility modifications. Further inspections post-remediation are advised to verify adherence to building codes.
