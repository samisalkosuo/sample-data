- Purpose of Inspection: Routine annual building safety check.

**4. Observations and Findings**

*Structural:*  
The structural integrity of the building appears sound. The reinforced concrete frame shows minimal signs of cracking, consistent with age and climatic conditions. Timber framing exhibits some minor water damage, likely due to past roof maintenance issues.

*Electrical:*  
Wiring is generally in good condition, adhering to modern safety standards. However, a few junction boxes show signs of corrosion requiring replacement for continued compliance.

*Plumbing:*  
Plumbing systems are functional but exhibit some deterioration in older pipes, particularly in the semi-basement utility areas. Recommendations include partial pipe replacement to prevent future leaks.

*HVAC:*  
Heating system (district heating connection) is operational and efficient. Air conditioning units show normal performance; however, filters need cleaning for optimal air quality.

*Fire Safety:*  
Smoke detectors are present on each floor and in key areas, functioning correctly. Fire extinguishers are adequately placed but require inspection and possible replacement due to expiration dates nearing.

*Accessibility:*  
The building has ramp access for wheelchair users, meeting current accessibility standards. However, door thresholds could be modified for smoother transitions.

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

- Replace corroded electrical junction boxes to ensure safety compliance.
- Address water damage in timber framing to prevent further deterioration.
- Partially replace older plumbing pipes in the semi-basement to mitigate leak risks.
- Inspect and replace expired fire extinguishers.
- Clean HVAC air filters for improved air quality.
- Consider modifying door thresholds for enhanced accessibility.

**6. Compliance Summary**

The building largely complies with current Finnish building codes (e.g., Basinii, 2017), noting minor deviations in electrical and fire safety components that require immediate attention to maintain full compliance.

**7. Conclusion**

This residential property in Rääkkylä, constructed in 2004, is generally well-maintained but requires attention to specific areas for continued safety and code adherence. Immediate action on electrical, plumbing, fire safety, and accessibility recommendations is advised to ensure the building's ongoing compliance with Finnish regulations.
