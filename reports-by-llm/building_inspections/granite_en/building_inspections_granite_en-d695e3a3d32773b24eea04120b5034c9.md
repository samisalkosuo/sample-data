**Official Building Inspection Report**

**1. General Information**

- Country: Finland  
- Municipality: Jomala  
- Address: Kauppakatu 12, 40100 Jomala, Finland  
- Inspection Date: 12.09.2024  
- Inspector Name: Marko Pietilä

**2. Building Overview**

- Type: Residential (Single-family detached house)  
- Construction Year: 1977  
- Number of Floors: Two  
- Primary Materials: Reinforced concrete frame with timber framing, brick veneer, and asphalt shingle roofing.

**3. Inspection Context**

- Weather Conditions: The inspection was conducted under partly cloudy skies with a temperature of 14°C and moderate humidity, typical for the late summer in Jomala, Finland.  
- Purpose of Inspection: Routine annual check.

**4. Observations and Findings**

*Structural:*  
The building's structural integrity appears sound with minimal signs of settlement or distress. The reinforced concrete frame exhibits no cracks exceeding 0.5mm, and the timber framing shows standard wear consistent with its age.

*Electrical:*  
The electrical system is outdated, featuring a mix of old wiring (likely original) and some newer additions. There are concerns regarding overfused circuits and lack of ground-fault circuit interrupters (GFCIs), particularly in bathrooms and kitchen areas.

*Plumbing:*  
The plumbing system includes galvanized steel pipes, which show signs of corrosion and reduced water flow. Recommend replacement with modern PVC or copper piping to prevent future leaks and improve efficiency.

*HVAC:*  
The heating system is an old oil-fired boiler with radiators, functioning adequately but inefficiently. Consider upgrading to a more energy-efficient solution like a heat pump for better performance and compliance with modern energy standards.

*Fire Safety:*  
Smoke detectors are present on each floor but require battery replacement. Installation of interconnected smoke alarms and a fire extinguisher in accessible locations is recommended.

*Accessibility:*  
The property lacks features to accommodate individuals with disabilities, such as grab bars in bathrooms or ramp access. Modifications are advised to meet current accessibility standards.

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

- Electrical: Upgrade wiring to comply with current safety standards and install GFCIs in wet areas.  
- Plumbing: Replace corroded galvanized steel pipes with modern materials to prevent leaks and improve water pressure.  
- HVAC: Evaluate transition to a more efficient heating system, such as a heat pump, for energy savings and environmental compliance.  
- Fire Safety: Ensure all smoke detectors are battery-operated and interconnected; install fire extinguishers in strategic locations.  
- Accessibility: Incorporate accessibility features to meet current standards, including bathroom modifications and ramp access.

**6. Compliance Summary**

The property generally complies with Finnish building codes for structural integrity and basic safety requirements. However, significant deviations exist in electrical, plumbing, HVAC systems, fire safety equipment, and accessibility features, necessitating updates to meet contemporary standards.

**7. Conclusion**

The residential property at Kauppakatu 12, Jomala, exhibits a solid structural foundation but requires comprehensive modernization of its electrical, plumbing, HVAC systems, fire safety measures, and accessibility features to ensure compliance with current Finnish building regulations and enhance overall safety and efficiency.
