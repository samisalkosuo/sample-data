- Municipality: Heinola
- Address: Kauppakatu 23, 37100 Heinola, Finland
- Inspection Date: 05.12.2024 (DD.MM.YYYY format)
- Inspector Name: Jari Pekkarinen

**2. Building Overview**

- Type: Residential
- Construction Year: 1971
- Number of Floors: Two-story building with a pitched roof
- Primary Materials: Brick facade, timber frame construction, and plastered concrete interior walls

**3. Inspection Context**

- Weather Conditions on Inspection Date: Cold and overcast, with temperatures around -5Â°C and light snowfall. Typical for late autumn in Heinola, Finland.
- Purpose of Inspection: Routine annual inspection to assess the structural integrity and compliance with current building codes.

**4. Observations and Findings**

*Structural:*  
The building's foundation appears sound with minimal cracking, consistent with age and climate conditions. The timber framing shows signs of natural wear but remains adequately supported. Roof structure is in fair condition, with some minor sagging noted that will require monitoring.

*Electrical:*  
The electrical system includes outdated wiring which does not meet current safety standards. There are ungrounded outlets and insufficient circuit protection. Recommend replacement of the entire electrical system to ensure safety compliance.

*Plumbing:*  
Plumbing fixtures are generally functional, though some pipes show signs of corrosion. Water supply lines and drainage appear adequate but may benefit from partial replacement to prevent future leaks or blockages.

*HVAC:*  
The heating system, an old oil-fired boiler, is operational but inefficient. Recommend consideration of upgrading to a more modern, energy-efficient solution such as a heat pump for better performance and cost savings.

*Fire Safety:*  
Smoke detectors are present on each floor but require battery replacement. There is no sprinkler system installed, which is mandatory for residential buildings under current regulations. Installation of a fire sprinkler system is recommended.

*Accessibility:*  
The building has limited accessibility features, with narrow doorways and lack of ramp access. Recommend improvements to meet current accessibility standards, including widening door frames and installing ramps where necessary.

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

- **Electrical System:** Replace all wiring and install grounded outlets with appropriate circuit breakers.
- **Plumbing:** Inspect and replace corroded sections of pipework to prevent future leaks.
- **HVAC:** Upgrade heating system to a modern, energy-efficient alternative like a heat pump.
- **Fire Safety:** Install a fire sprinkler system in compliance with current regulations. Replace smoke detector batteries immediately.
- **Accessibility:** Modify doorways and install ramps to ensure compliance with accessibility standards.

**6. Compliance Summary**

The building demonstrates partial compliance with current Finnish building codes, particularly concerning electrical safety, fire protection, and accessibility. Major upgrades are necessary in electrical systems, HVAC, plumbing, and fire safety measures to meet contemporary standards. Accessibility modifications are also required to ensure the property is compliant with recent legislative changes.

**7. Conclusion**

Upon completion of the routine inspection on 05.12.2024, significant areas for improvement have been identified in this 1971 residential building located at Kauppakatu 23, Heinola. While structural elements remain sound, several systems (electrical, plumbing, HVAC) require modernization to ensure safety and efficiency. Fire protection and accessibility features are notably deficient and must be addressed promptly to comply with current Finnish regulations.
