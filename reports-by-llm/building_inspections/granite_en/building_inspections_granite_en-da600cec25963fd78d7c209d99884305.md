**Official Building Inspection Report**

**1. General Information**

- Country: Finland
- Municipality: Hyrynsalmi
- Address: Kauppakatu 23, 84600 Hyrynsalmi, Finland
- Inspection Date: 15.09.2024
- Inspector Name: Marko Pietil채

**2. Building Overview**

- Type: Residential (Single-family detached house)
- Construction Year: 2000
- Number of Floors: Two (ground floor and first floor)
- Primary Materials: Reinforced concrete frame with timber framing, exterior clad in wood fiber boards, roof covered with asphalt shingles.

**3. Inspection Context**

- Weather Conditions: Clear skies with a temperature of 14째C and moderate humidity, typical for late September in Hyrynsalmi. The inspection was conducted as part of a routine annual check.

**4. Observations and Findings**

*Structural:*  
The building's structural integrity appears sound, with no visible signs of settlement or distress. The reinforced concrete frame shows minor surface rust on reinforcing bars, consistent with age and environmental exposure.

*Electrical:*  
The electrical system is generally in good condition, though some outlets show signs of wear. Wiring appears to be compliant with current standards, but recommendations are made for upgrading to modern safety standards, including ground-fault circuit interrupters (GFCIs) in wet areas.

*Plumbing:*  
Plumbing fixtures and pipes appear functional without leaks or significant corrosion. However, the water heater shows signs of age and is recommended for replacement to ensure efficiency and safety.

*HVAC:*  
The heating system (gas-fired forced-air furnace) operates efficiently. The cooling system (window air conditioners) is adequate but could be improved with central air conditioning for better comfort. Insulation levels are appropriate for the climate, though additional attic insulation might be beneficial.

*Fire Safety:*  
Smoke detectors are present on each floor and in key areas, functioning correctly. The fire alarm system is non-existent; installation of an integrated smoke and carbon monoxide alarm system is recommended for enhanced safety.

*Accessibility:*  
The property has a ramp leading to the entrance, complying with accessibility standards. Interior doorways are wide enough, but recommendations include installing grab bars in bathrooms for additional support.

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

- Upgrade electrical outlets to meet current safety standards (GFCIs).
- Replace the water heater with a modern energy-efficient model.
- Consider central air conditioning for improved climate control.
- Enhance fire safety by installing an integrated smoke and carbon monoxide alarm system.
- Improve bathroom accessibility with grab bars.

**6. Compliance Summary**

The building generally complies with Finnish residential construction codes, notably those concerning structural integrity, plumbing, and basic electrical installations. However, certain areas fall short of current recommended practices, particularly in electrical safety and fire protection systems.

**7. Conclusion**

This report summarizes the inspection conducted on 15.09.2024 by Marko Pietil채 for a two-story residential property located at Kauppakatu 23, Hyrynsalmi. While the building maintains structural soundness and adheres to fundamental safety codes, several areas require updates to meet contemporary standards and enhance occupant safety and comfort. It is recommended that the owner address the identified issues promptly for optimal living conditions and compliance with evolving regulations.
