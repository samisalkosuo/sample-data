**4. Observations and Findings**

*Structural:*  
The building's structural integrity appears sound, with the reinforced concrete frame showing minimal signs of deterioration. Timber framing exhibits some moisture-related discoloration, suggesting past water ingress issues that have been addressed.

*Electrical:*  
Wiring is generally in good condition, though some outdated components were noted and recommended for replacement to meet current safety standards. The electrical panel shows signs of wear but remains functional.

*Plumbing:*  
Plumbing systems are adequate, with no immediate leaks identified. However, galvanized steel pipes show evidence of corrosion, suggesting potential future issues requiring consideration for replacement during renovations or major maintenance.

*HVAC:*  
Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems are operational but inefficient. The age of the systems indicates a need for modernization to improve energy efficiency and performance.

*Fire Safety:*  
Fire safety measures, including smoke detectors and fire alarms, are present and functional. However, fire extinguishers require replacement as per manufacturer recommendations. Additionally, emergency exit signs could benefit from upgrading to LED technology for better visibility and longevity.

*Accessibility:*  
The building lacks modern accessibility features such as ramps and automated doors, which are recommended for compliance with current Finnish accessibility standards, particularly considering its public-facing industrial nature.
