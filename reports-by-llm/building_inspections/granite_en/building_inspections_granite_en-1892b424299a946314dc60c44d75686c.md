**Official Building Inspection Report**

**1. General Information**

- Country: Finland
- Municipality: Posio
- Address: Kauppakatu 23, 89700 Posio, Finland
- Inspection Date: 02.11.2024 (DD.MM.YYYY format)
- Inspector Name: Marko Pietilä

**2. Building Overview**

- Type: Public (Community Center)
- Construction Year: 1990
- Number of Floors: Two-story structure
- Primary Materials: Reinforced concrete frame with timber interior finishing, exterior clad in weatherboard siding typical for Finnish construction during the early 1990s.

**3. Inspection Context**

- Weather Conditions on Inspection Date: Overcast with intermittent light rain; typical autumnal conditions for Posio at this time of year.
- Purpose of Inspection: Routine safety and compliance check prior to the upcoming winter season.

**4. Observations and Findings**

*Structural:*  
The building's structural integrity appears sound, with no visible signs of distress or settlement. The reinforced concrete frame meets contemporary standards for load-bearing capacity.

*Electrical:*  
Wiring is mostly original and shows some degradation, particularly in areas exposed to moisture. Some outlets require replacement due to fraying cables. Overall, the electrical system poses a moderate safety risk if not updated.

*Plumbing:*  
Plumbing fixtures are functional but exhibit minor leaks in several locations, indicating the need for repair or replacement of aging pipes. Water pressure is adequate, though some faucets show signs of mineral buildup due to hard water.

*HVAC:*  
Heating system (gas-fired boiler with radiator network) operates efficiently but could benefit from an annual service check for optimal performance and safety. The cooling system (window air conditioners) is inadequate for modern comfort standards and should be considered for upgrade during renovations.

*Fire Safety:*  
Smoke detectors are present on each floor, though some batteries are low and need replacement. Fire extinguishers are located but require inspection to ensure functionality. Emergency exits are clearly marked but one exit door is obstructed by stored materials and needs clearing.

*Accessibility:*  
The building has ramp access for wheelchair users, complying with basic accessibility standards of the time. However, improvements could be made to elevate compliance with current regulations, particularly in bathroom facilities.

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

- **Electrical:** Replace all frayed wiring and outdated outlets to mitigate fire risk and ensure electrical safety.
- **Plumbing:** Address leaks by repairing or replacing affected pipes, and consider installing a water softening system to reduce mineral buildup.
- **HVAC:** Schedule an annual service for the heating system and explore modernizing cooling solutions suitable for contemporary comfort standards.
- **Fire Safety:** Replace low batteries in smoke detectors, inspect fire extinguishers, and clear obstructions from emergency exits to ensure unimpeded evacuation routes.
- **Accessibility:** Update accessibility features, especially in restrooms, to meet current Finnish building codes for persons with disabilities.

**6. Compliance Summary**

The building generally complies with the 1990 construction standards but falls short of current regulations, particularly concerning electrical safety, plumbing integrity, HVAC efficiency, fire safety equipment maintenance, and accessibility features. While structurally sound, several areas require attention to meet today's stringent building codes and ensure occupant safety and comfort.

**7. Conclusion**

This inspection reveals that while the community center in Posio retains its original structural integrity, various systems and features necessitate updates to align with modern standards. Immediate actions are recommended for electrical, plumbing, fire safety, and accessibility improvements. Further detailed planning is advised for a comprehensive renovation project to enhance both safety and functionality.
