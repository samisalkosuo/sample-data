- Address: Kauppakatu 12, 28600 Paimio, Finland
- Inspection Date: 19.04.2025 (DD.MM.YYYY)
- Inspector Name: Jari Pietilä

**2. Building Overview**

- Type: Public (Community Center)
- Construction Year: 1991
- Number of Floors: Two-story building with a basement level
- Primary Materials: Reinforced concrete structure, brick facade, and timber interior finishes

**3. Inspection Context**

- Weather Conditions: The inspection was conducted under partly cloudy skies with a temperature of 12°C and moderate winds, typical for the transitional period between spring and summer in Paimio, Finland.
- Purpose of Inspection: Routine annual compliance check

**4. Observations and Findings**

*Structural:*  
The building's structural integrity appears sound with no visible signs of distress or settlement. The reinforced concrete frame adheres to the design specifications from 1991. Minor cracking in non-load-bearing areas was noted, consistent with aging and typical for buildings of this vintage.

*Electrical:*  
The electrical system shows signs of age but remains functional. Wiring insulation is intact, though some outdated components require updating to meet current safety standards. The main panel and subpanels are adequately sized for the building's load.

*Plumbing:*  
Plumbing fixtures are generally in good condition, with no immediate leaks identified. However, galvanized steel pipes show signs of corrosion, suggesting potential future issues. Recommend replacement with more durable materials like copper or PEX.

*HVAC:*  
The heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system operates efficiently but could benefit from an upgrade to improve energy efficiency. The existing split-system units are nearing the end of their service life and may require replacement soon.

*Fire Safety:*  
Fire safety measures, including smoke detectors and fire alarms, are present and functional. However, fire extinguishers need to be checked and possibly replaced due to expiration dates. Additionally, emergency lighting requires updating to ensure compliance with current regulations.

*Accessibility:*  
The building has ramp access for wheelchair users, but door thresholds exceed recommended heights for full accessibility compliance. Adjustments are advised to meet ADA-like standards prevalent in Finland.

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

1. Address minor cracking in non-structural areas with sealant application to prevent water ingress.
2. Update electrical components, particularly those showing wear or outdated technology, to ensure safety and compliance.
3. Replace corroded galvanized steel pipes with modern materials to avoid future plumbing issues.
4. Upgrade HVAC system for improved energy efficiency and performance.
5. Inspect and replace expired fire extinguishers; update emergency lighting to meet current standards.
6. Adjust door thresholds to ensure full accessibility compliance.

**6. Compliance Summary**

The building generally complies with Finnish building codes (e.g., Basin- and Building Act) but requires attention to several areas for full compliance, particularly in electrical systems, plumbing, fire safety, and accessibility features. Addressing these issues will bring the property into alignment with current regulatory standards.

**7. Conclusion**

Upon completion of this routine inspection on 19.04.2025, the community center in Paimio demonstrates satisfactory overall condition despite aging elements. Immediate attention to recommended improvements will ensure continued safe and compliant operation.
