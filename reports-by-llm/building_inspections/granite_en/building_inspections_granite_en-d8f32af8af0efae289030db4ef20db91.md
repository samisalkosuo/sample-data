**Official Building Inspection Report**

**1. General Information**

- Country: Finland
- Municipality: Enonkoski
- Address: Kauppakatu 12, 45600 Enonkoski, Finland
- Inspection Date: 09.09.2024 (DD.MM.YYYY)
- Inspector Name: Jari P. Lehtinen

**2. Building Overview**

- Type: Public (Community Center)
- Construction Year: 1984
- Number of Floors: Two-story structure
- Primary Materials: Reinforced concrete frame with timber framing and brick veneer cladding

**3. Inspection Context**

- Weather Conditions: Clear, mild day with temperatures around 15°C (59°F) and light breeze, typical for early autumn in Enonkoski.
- Purpose of Inspection: Routine annual inspection to ensure ongoing safety and compliance with current building codes.

**4. Observations and Findings**

*Structural:*  
The reinforced concrete frame exhibits minor cracking, consistent with age and typical for structures of this vintage. No immediate structural concerns were identified.

*Electrical:*  
Wiring appears to be original and shows signs of wear. Some non-compliant outlets were noted; recommendations for upgrading to meet current safety standards are advised.

*Plumbing:*  
Plumbing fixtures are functional but show signs of corrosion, particularly in older sections. Recommend replacement of affected pipes to prevent leaks and potential water damage.

*HVAC:*  
Heating system (oil-fired boiler) is operational but inefficient. Suggest exploring modern, energy-saving alternatives for improved sustainability and cost-effectiveness.

*Fire Safety:*  
Smoke detectors are present but may require battery replacement or interconnection for comprehensive coverage. Fire extinguishers were found to be expired; immediate replacement is recommended.

*Accessibility:*  
The building has ramp access, but door thresholds exceed recommended heights for wheelchair accessibility. Adjustments are suggested to comply with current accessibility standards.

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

- **Electrical:** Upgrade wiring to meet contemporary safety codes; install ground fault circuit interrupters (GFCIs) in wet areas.
- **Plumbing:** Replace corroded pipes, particularly those supplying potable water, to prevent leaks and ensure water quality.
- **HVAC:** Evaluate and potentially replace the oil-fired boiler with a modern, energy-efficient heating solution (e.g., heat pump).
- **Fire Safety:** Ensure all smoke detectors are functioning correctly and interconnected; replace expired fire extinguishers.
- **Accessibility:** Adjust door thresholds to meet current accessibility standards for wheelchair users.

**6. Compliance Summary**

The building generally complies with contemporary Finnish building codes, notwithstanding some areas requiring updates to electrical systems, plumbing fixtures, fire safety equipment, and accessibility features. While the structural integrity is sound, proactive measures are recommended to enhance safety and efficiency.

**7. Conclusion**

The Enonkoski Community Center, constructed in 1984, demonstrates satisfactory structural condition but requires attention to several systems to ensure ongoing compliance with current regulations and improved functionality. It is recommended that the municipality schedule necessary upgrades to electrical, plumbing, HVAC, fire safety, and accessibility features.
