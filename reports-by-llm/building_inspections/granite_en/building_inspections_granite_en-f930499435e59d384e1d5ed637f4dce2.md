**Official Building Inspection Report**

**1. General Information**

- **Country:** Finland  
- **Municipality:** Puumala  
- **Address:** Kauppakatu 23, 35100 Puumala, Finland  
- **Inspection Date:** 16.09.2024  
- **Inspector Name:** Marko Hietanen  

**2. Building Overview**

- **Type:** Industrial  
- **Construction Year:** 1998  
- **Number of Floors:** Two-story structure, typical for industrial buildings from the late 1990s in Finland.  
- **Primary Materials:** Reinforced concrete frame with brick and steel cladding, common for durability and fire resistance in Finnish industrial constructions of that period.  

**3. Inspection Context**

- **Weather Conditions:** The inspection was conducted under partly cloudy skies with a temperature of 14Â°C and moderate humidity, typical for the transitional autumn weather in Puumala at this time of year.  
- **Purpose of Inspection:** Routine annual compliance check as mandated by local municipal regulations.  

**4. Observations and Findings**

- **Structural Integrity:** The building frame shows minor signs of settlement, consistent with its age. No immediate structural concerns were identified.  
- **Electrical Systems:** Wiring appears to be in good condition, though some components are nearing the end of their expected lifespan and may require updating for safety.  
- **Plumbing:** Plumbing fixtures are functional but show signs of corrosion, particularly in older steel pipes. Recommend replacement to prevent future leaks or contamination.  
- **HVAC Systems:** Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems are operational but less efficient than modern standards, suggesting potential for upgrade to improve energy efficiency.  
- **Fire Safety:** Fire alarm system is present and tested; however, fire extinguishers require servicing and replacement due to expiration dates.  
- **Accessibility:** The building lacks ramp access for individuals with mobility impairments as per current Finnish accessibility standards (Kunnallinen luonnonsuojelu 63/2018).

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

- **Issue:** Outdated electrical components.  
  **Recommendation:** Replace or upgrade electrical systems to meet current safety codes and improve reliability.

- **Issue:** Corroded plumbing pipes.  
  **Recommendation:** Conduct a full plumbing overhaul, replacing corroded sections with modern materials to prevent future leaks and ensure water quality.

- **Issue:** Inefficient HVAC systems.  
  **Recommendation:** Evaluate the installation of energy-efficient HVAC solutions to reduce operational costs and environmental impact.

- **Issue:** Expired fire extinguishers.  
  **Recommendation:** Service or replace all fire safety equipment, ensuring compliance with Finnish safety regulations (e.g., PS 8310:2019).

- **Issue:** Lack of accessibility features.  
  **Recommendation:** Install ramps and other necessary modifications to ensure the building complies with accessibility standards outlined in Kunnallinen luonnonsuojelu 63/2018.

**6. Compliance Summary**

The building generally adheres to current Finnish building codes, notably PS 8001:2017 for structural requirements and PS 8310:2019 for fire safety. However, several areas fall short of compliance regarding electrical systems, plumbing, HVAC efficiency, and accessibility. Immediate attention to these issues is advised to maintain a safe and functional industrial space.

**7. Conclusion**

The inspected industrial building in Puumala demonstrates satisfactory structural integrity but requires updates across various systems to meet contemporary standards and regulations. It is recommended that the property owner address electrical, plumbing, HVAC, fire safety, and accessibility concerns promptly to ensure ongoing compliance and tenant/user safety.
