- Purpose of Inspection: Routine compliance check as part of annual municipal regulatory procedures.

**4. Observations and Findings**

*Structural:*  
The building's structural integrity appears sound with minimal signs of settlement or distress. The reinforced concrete frame shows standard wear consistent with its age, no immediate concerns identified.

*Electrical:*  
The electrical system is outdated but functional. Non-compliant wiring and lack of ground-fault circuit interrupters (GFCIs) in wet areas noted. Recommend updating to meet current safety standards.

*Plumbing:*  
Plumbing fixtures are generally in good condition, though some corrosion in older pipes suggests potential future leaks. Water pressure is adequate but inconsistent, possibly due to aging infrastructure.

*HVAC:*  
Heating and cooling systems are operational but inefficient. The old heating system (likely hydronic radiators) could benefit from modernization for energy savings.

*Fire Safety:*  
Smoke detectors present but lack interconnectivity, which is a code violation. Fire extinguishers are located appropriately but some are expired, requiring replacement.

*Accessibility:*  
The building has limited accessibility features, with no ramp access and narrow doorways posing challenges for individuals with mobility impairments. Recommend improvements to meet current accessibility standards.

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

- Upgrade electrical system to include GFCIs and modern wiring.
- Inspect and replace corroded plumbing sections proactively.
- Consider replacing inefficient HVAC systems for energy efficiency.
- Ensure smoke detectors are interconnected and all fire safety equipment is up-to-date.
- Install ramp access and widen doorways to comply with accessibility regulations.

**6. Compliance Summary**

The building generally complies with current Finnish Building Code (Hakuohje) but falls short in several areas, notably electrical safety, plumbing integrity, fire safety equipment, and accessibility features. Immediate attention to these issues is advised to ensure full compliance and occupant safety.

**7. Conclusion**

Upon completion of this routine inspection on 08.05.2025, the commercial property at Kauppakatu 23 in Alajärvi demonstrates satisfactory structural integrity but requires significant updates to meet contemporary standards in electrical systems, plumbing, fire safety, HVAC efficiency, and accessibility. 

I recommend the property owner address these noted deficiencies promptly to ensure compliance with Finnish building regulations and enhance overall safety and functionality of the premises.
