- Purpose of Inspection: Routine annual compliance check

**4. Observations and Findings**

*Structural:*  
The building's structural elements appear sound, with minimal signs of settlement or distress. The reinforced concrete columns and beams show standard wear consistent with the age of construction.

*Electrical:*  
The electrical system is outdated, featuring a mix of old wiring and some newer installations. There are concerns regarding overloaded circuits and potential fire hazards due to lack of modern ground-fault circuit interrupters (GFCIs).

*Plumbing:*  
Plumbing fixtures are generally functional but show signs of corrosion, particularly in the basement area. Water supply lines exhibit minor leaks that require attention to prevent water damage and mold growth.

*HVAC:*  
The heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system is operational but inefficient. The old boiler shows signs of wear and may need upgrading for energy efficiency and compliance with current environmental standards.

*Fire Safety:*  
Fire safety measures are partially compliant. Smoke detectors are present but some are outdated, and there is a lack of sprinkler systems as per modern regulations. Emergency exits are clearly marked but one exit is obstructed by storage.

*Accessibility:*  
The building has limited accessibility features. There is no ramp access for wheelchair users, and doorways are narrower than current standards recommend.

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

- **Electrical:** Upgrade electrical system to include GFCIs and modern wiring throughout the premises.
- **Plumbing:** Replace corroded pipes in the basement and conduct a full inspection of water supply lines for leaks and necessary repairs.
- **HVAC:** Evaluate and replace the existing boiler with an energy-efficient model, ensuring proper insulation and ventilation upgrades.
- **Fire Safety:** Install modern smoke detectors throughout, including heat and carbon monoxide alarms. Clear obstructions from emergency exits and ensure compliance with current fire safety codes.
- **Accessibility:** Install ramp access at the entrance and widen doorways to meet contemporary accessibility standards.

**6. Compliance Summary**

The building demonstrates partial compliance with current Finnish building regulations, particularly concerning electrical systems, plumbing, HVAC efficiency, fire safety, and accessibility. While structural integrity is maintained, several areas require updating to meet modern standards and ensure occupant safety and comfort.

**7. Conclusion**

Upon completion of the routine inspection on 28.12.2024, by Inspector Jari Pietilä, it is recommended that the property owner address the noted deficiencies to bring the commercial retail store at Kauppakatu 23, Ähtäri, into full compliance with Finnish building codes and safety regulations. Failure to do so may result in operational restrictions or fines from local authorities.
