- Primary Materials: Reinforced concrete frame, timber framing for interior partitions, metal cladding exterior, and a flat roof with thermal insulation

**3. Inspection Context**

- Weather Conditions on Inspection Date: Overcast with intermittent light rain; temperature was 5°C (41°F). This weather condition is typical for early spring in Kauhajoki, Finland.
- Purpose of Inspection: Routine safety and compliance check

**4. Observations and Findings**

*Structural:*  
The building's structural integrity appears sound with no visible signs of distress or settlement. The reinforced concrete frame shows minimal cracking consistent with natural thermal movement, posing no immediate concern.

*Electrical:*  
The electrical system is generally in good condition. However, some outdated wiring was noted in less accessible areas, which should be updated to meet current safety standards.

*Plumbing:*  
Plumbing fixtures are functional but show signs of minor corrosion, particularly in older sections. Recommend replacement of affected pipes to prevent future leaks or water quality issues.

*HVAC:*  
Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems are operational. The heat exchanger shows some wear, suggesting potential efficiency loss; maintenance and possible component replacement may be necessary for optimal performance.

*Fire Safety:*  
Smoke detectors and fire alarms are present and functioning. However, the sprinkler system requires reactivation as it was found deactivated during inspection.

*Accessibility:*  
The building complies with basic accessibility standards, though improvements could be made to ensure full compliance with current regulations, particularly regarding ramp gradients and doorway widths in certain areas.

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

- Update electrical wiring in less accessible areas to meet contemporary safety codes.
- Replace corroded sections of plumbing to prevent future leaks and ensure water quality.
- Service or replace the HVAC heat exchanger for improved energy efficiency.
- Reactivate and test the sprinkler system to ensure fire safety compliance.
- Enhance accessibility features, particularly ramp gradients and doorway dimensions, to meet current standards fully.

**6. Compliance Summary**

The building generally complies with Finnish industrial building codes (e.g., SFS-ISO 19011 for management system requirements). However, certain areas fall short of full compliance due to outdated components and minor structural deficiencies noted above. Addressing these issues will bring the structure into alignment with current regulations.
