*Structural:*  
The building's structural integrity appears sound, with no visible signs of distress or settlement. The reinforced concrete frame shows minimal cracking consistent with age and climate conditions.

*Electrical:*  
Wiring is generally in good condition, though some outdated components were noted near the main panel requiring replacement to meet current safety standards.

*Plumbing:*  
Plumbing systems are functional but exhibit minor leaks in several fixtures, suggesting the need for part replacements. Water supply lines show signs of corrosion, necessitating inspection for potential lead content.

*HVAC:*  
Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems are operational but less efficient than modern standards. The boiler shows signs of wear and may require servicing or replacement soon.

*Fire Safety:*  
Smoke detectors and fire alarms are present and functional. However, fire extinguishers need to be replenished, and the fire escape routes could benefit from clearer signage for better visibility during winter conditions.

*Accessibility:*  
The building has ramp access but lacks an accessible restroom on the ground floor, which does not comply with current accessibility standards.
