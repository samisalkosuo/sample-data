The structural integrity of the building appears sound, with no visible signs of settlement or distress. The reinforced concrete frame meets contemporary Finnish construction standards for residential buildings constructed post-2010.

*Electrical:*  
The electrical system is generally compliant but noted are a few minor issues: outdated wiring in some non-load-bearing areas and the absence of Ground Fault Circuit Interrupters (GFCIs) in bathrooms, which will need updating to meet current safety standards.

*Plumbing:*  
Plumbing fixtures are in good condition with no leaks identified. However, the water heater shows signs of corrosion and should be replaced preemptively to avoid future issues.

*HVAC:*  
The heating system (underfloor hydronic radiant) functions efficiently. The air-conditioning unit requires cleaning and filter replacement for optimal performance.
