**4. Observations and Findings**

*Structural:*  
The structural integrity of the building appears sound with no visible signs of settlement or distress. The reinforced concrete foundation and frame are in good condition, consistent with a 13-year-old construction. Minor cracking was noted in the basement walls, attributed to seasonal temperature fluctuations and typical for this type of material.

*Electrical:*  
The electrical system is generally compliant with current standards. However, some non-grounded outlets were identified, particularly in older extensions. Recommendation: Upgrade all outlets to grounded configurations to meet contemporary safety codes.

*Plumbing:*  
Plumbing fixtures are in working order, though there are signs of minor water damage around the kitchen sink due to a leaking pipe underneath. Recommendation: Repair or replace the compromised section of piping to prevent further moisture-related issues.

*HVAC:*  
The heating system (hydronic radiators) functions correctly, but the air conditioning unit shows signs of wear and could benefit from servicing. Recommendation: Schedule professional maintenance for the HVAC system to ensure optimal performance and longevity.

*Fire Safety:*  
Smoke detectors are present on each floor and in key areas, functioning properly. However, there is no sprinkler system installed, which is in compliance with current regulations for single-family dwellings in Finland but may be considered for future enhancements.

*Accessibility:*  
The property has a ramp leading to the entrance, meeting basic accessibility requirements. The interior layout shows some areas that could benefit from improvements to accommodate individuals with mobility challenges more effectively. Recommendation: Consider modifications such as widening doorways and installing grab bars in bathrooms for enhanced accessibility.
