**Official Building Inspection Report**

**1. General Information**

- Country: Finland  
- Municipality: Mäntsälä  
- Address: Kauppakatu 12, 02510 Mäntsälä, Finland  
- Inspection Date: 06.12.2024  
- Inspector Name: Jari Pietilä

**2. Building Overview**

- Type: Public (Community Center)  
- Construction Year: 2004  
- Number of Floors: Two-story structure with a basement level  
- Primary Materials: Reinforced concrete frame, timber framing for interior walls, and a metal roof clad with asphalt shingles. Exterior walls are constructed with brick veneer over a wooden frame.

**3. Inspection Context**

- Weather Conditions: The inspection was conducted under partly cloudy skies with a temperature of -5°C and light snowfall, typical for late December in Mäntsälä.  
- Purpose of Inspection: Routine annual safety and compliance check.

**4. Observations and Findings**

*Structural:*  
- Foundation: Generally sound with minor cracking observed, consistent with settling over time.  
- Load-bearing walls and columns: In good condition, no signs of distress or deformation.  
- Roof structure: Metal trusses appear robust; roof cladding shows minor wear but is structurally intact.  

*Electrical:*  
- Wiring: Mostly updated to current standards, though some older sections in less accessible areas require inspection for potential upgrades.  
- Electrical panel: Functioning properly, with adequate capacity for the building's needs.  

*Plumbing:*  
- Water supply lines: Generally good condition, but some galvanized steel pipes show signs of corrosion and may need replacement.  
- Drainage system: Functional, though older cast iron sections in the basement could benefit from inspection for potential leaks or blockages.  

*HVAC:*  
- Heating system: Older gas boiler efficient but nearing end of lifecycle; consideration for modernization is advised.  
- Ventilation: Adequate but could be improved with additional mechanical ventilation to meet current energy efficiency standards.  

*Fire Safety:*  
- Fire alarm and detection systems: Present and operational, though batteries in some detectors are due for replacement.  
- Fire extinguishers: Some are expired; all should be replaced immediately.  
- Emergency exits: Clearly marked but one exit requires adjustment for wheelchair accessibility.  

*Accessibility:*  
- Ramp access to the building entrance is present but steep, not fully compliant with current ADA standards.  

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

1. Replace expired fire extinguishers promptly.
2. Inspect and potentially replace corroded galvanized steel water supply lines.
3. Examine cast iron drainage sections in the basement for leaks or blockages.
4. Consider upgrading the heating system to a more energy-efficient model.
5. Install additional mechanical ventilation to enhance air quality and meet contemporary standards.
6. Adjust ramp gradient to comply with accessibility regulations.

**6. Compliance Summary**

The building generally complies with current Finnish building codes (BS 1363, BS EN 1991-1-4 for structural integrity; electrical installations adhere to FS 3027:2018; plumbing roughly follows FS 3050:2018). However, several areas require attention to ensure full compliance and safety.

**7. Conclusion**

The Mäntsälä Community Center, constructed in 2004, is in moderate condition with aging infrastructure components. While the structural integrity remains sound, various systems (electrical, plumbing, HVAC, fire safety, and accessibility) necessitate updates to meet current standards and ensure occupant safety. It is recommended that the property owner address these issues promptly to maintain compliance and enhance functionality.
