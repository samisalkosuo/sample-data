**4. Observations and Findings**

*Structural:*  
The foundation appears sound with no visible cracks or settlement issues. The wooden frame shows minor signs of decay, primarily around window and door frames, which may require attention to prevent further deterioration.

*Electrical:*  
The electrical system is outdated, featuring a mix of old wiring and some newer additions. There are no immediate safety hazards identified but recommendations for upgrading the entire system to meet current standards are advised.

*Plumbing:*  
Plumbing fixtures are generally functional, though some pipes show signs of corrosion. Recommend replacement of affected sections to prevent leaks and potential water damage.

*HVAC:*  
The heating system (wood-fired) is operational but inefficient and non-compliant with modern emission standards. Suggestion: Consider transitioning to a more efficient, low-emission heating solution such as a heat pump.

*Fire Safety:*  
Smoke detectors are present on each floor but require battery replacement. Installation of interconnected smoke alarms and a fire extinguisher in accessible locations is recommended.

*Accessibility:*  
The building has limited accessibility features, with narrow doorways and no ramp access. Recommendations include widening some doorways and installing a ramp to comply with current accessibility regulations.

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

- Address wood decay around window and door frames promptly to prevent structural integrity issues.
- Upgrade electrical system to meet contemporary safety standards, ensuring ground fault circuit interrupters (GFCIs) are installed in wet areas.
- Replace corroded plumbing sections to avoid leaks and water damage.
- Transition the heating system from wood-fired to a modern, efficient heat pump for compliance with emission regulations and improved energy efficiency.
- Replace smoke detector batteries and install interconnected smoke alarms throughout the property. Ensure fire extinguishers are accessible in living areas.
- Modify entryways to improve accessibility, widening door frames where necessary and installing a ramp for wheelchair access.

**6. Compliance Summary**

The building generally complies with current Finnish building codes; however, several areas fall short of recent amendments regarding electrical safety, heating efficiency, fire protection, and accessibility standards. Immediate attention to these issues is recommended to ensure full compliance.
