**Official Building Inspection Report**

**1. General Information**

- Country: Finland
- Municipality: Mustasaari
- Address: Kauppakatu 23, 00120 Helsinki (Note: This address is fictional for the purpose of this report)
- Inspection Date: 23.09.2024
- Inspector Name: Johanna Pietilä

**2. Building Overview**

- Type: Industrial
- Construction Year: 2002
- Number of Floors: Two-story structure, typical for industrial buildings from that era in Finland.
- Primary Materials: Reinforced concrete frame with a metal cladding exterior, common for durability and fire resistance in industrial constructions post-2000.

**3. Inspection Context**

- Weather Conditions: The inspection was conducted under partly cloudy skies with a temperature of 14°C and moderate humidity, typical for the transitional Finnish autumn.
- Purpose of Inspection: Routine safety and compliance check as per local municipal regulations.

**4. Observations and Findings**

*Structural:*  
The building's structural integrity appears sound with no visible signs of distress or settlement. The reinforced concrete frame meets contemporary standards for industrial use.

*Electrical:*  
The electrical system shows some outdated components, including non-grounded outlets and older wiring. These need upgrading to meet current safety codes.

*Plumbing:*  
Plumbing fixtures are generally in good condition but show minor signs of corrosion, particularly in older sections. Recommend replacement of affected pipes to prevent leaks.

*HVAC:*  
Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems are operational but inefficient. Suggest upgrading to more energy-efficient models to align with modern environmental standards.

*Fire Safety:*  
Smoke detectors and fire alarms are present and functional. However, the fire suppression system requires servicing and potential upgrade to comply with current regulations.

*Accessibility:*  
The building lacks ramp access for individuals with mobility impairments. Installation of a ramp at the main entrance is recommended to ensure compliance with accessibility laws.

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

- Electrical: Upgrade electrical system to include grounded outlets and modern wiring.
- Plumbing: Replace corroded sections of piping to prevent water damage risks.
- HVAC: Install energy-efficient HVAC units to reduce operational costs and environmental impact.
- Fire Safety: Service the fire suppression system and consider upgrading it if necessary.
- Accessibility: Install a ramp at the main entrance to meet accessibility standards.

**6. Compliance Summary**

The building generally complies with current Finnish industrial building codes, except for electrical systems, plumbing, HVAC efficiency, fire safety equipment maintenance, and lack of accessibility features. Immediate attention is required for the non-compliant areas to ensure safety and legal adherence.

**7. Conclusion**

Upon completion of this inspection on 23.09.2024, the industrial building at Kauppakatu 23, Helsinki, demonstrates satisfactory structural integrity but requires updates in several critical areas to meet contemporary safety and accessibility standards. It is recommended that the owner address the identified issues promptly to ensure compliance with Finnish building regulations and enhance overall safety and efficiency.
