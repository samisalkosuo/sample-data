- Municipality: Saltvik
- Address: Kauppakatu 23, 40100 Saltvik, Finland
- Inspection Date: 26.08.2024
- Inspector Name: Marko Pietil채

**2. Building Overview**

- Type: Industrial (Manufacturing Facility)
- Construction Year: 1989
- Number of Floors: Two-story structure
- Primary Materials: Reinforced concrete and steel framework, with a brick facade typical of late 20th-century Finnish construction.

**3. Inspection Context**

- Weather Conditions: The inspection was conducted under partly cloudy skies with temperatures around 18째C (64째F), consistent with the late summer in Saltvik, Finland.
- Purpose of Inspection: Routine safety and compliance check.

**4. Observations and Findings**

*Structural:*  
The building's structural integrity appears sound, with minimal signs of settlement or distress. The reinforced concrete construction adheres to the standards of the time.

*Electrical:*  
The electrical system shows some outdated components, including non-grounded outlets and wiring that does not meet current safety codes. There are also insufficient circuits for modern industrial loads.

*Plumbing:*  
Plumbing fixtures are functional but exhibit signs of corrosion, particularly in older galvanized steel pipes. Water pressure is adequate, though some sections require replacement to prevent leaks.

*HVAC:*  
The heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system is operational but inefficient. The aging units show signs of wear and could benefit from modernization for energy savings.

*Fire Safety:*  
Fire safety measures are present, including fire alarms and some fire extinguishers, though the sprinkler system is absent and would be required by current regulations.

*Accessibility:*  
The building lacks ramp access for individuals with mobility impairments, failing to meet contemporary accessibility standards.

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

- **Electrical:** Upgrade electrical system to include grounded outlets and sufficient circuit capacity for industrial use. Replace outdated wiring to ensure safety compliance.
- **Plumbing:** Replace corroded sections of plumbing with modern materials to prevent leaks and water damage.
- **HVAC:** Evaluate and replace aging HVAC units to improve energy efficiency and system reliability.
- **Fire Safety:** Install a sprinkler system in compliance with current fire safety regulations.
- **Accessibility:** Install ramps and ensure all entrances meet accessibility standards for individuals with disabilities.

**6. Compliance Summary**

The building partially complies with current Finnish building codes, particularly concerning electrical systems, plumbing, HVAC, fire safety, and accessibility. While the structural integrity is satisfactory, several areas require upgrades to meet modern standards and regulations.

**7. Conclusion**

This inspection reveals that while the 1989 industrial facility in Saltvik maintains adequate structural soundness, significant updates are necessary across various systems to ensure safety, efficiency, and compliance with current Finnish building codes. It is recommended that the property owner undertake the suggested improvements promptly to avoid potential hazards and liabilities.
