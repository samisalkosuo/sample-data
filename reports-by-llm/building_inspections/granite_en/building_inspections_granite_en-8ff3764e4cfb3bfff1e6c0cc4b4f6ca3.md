**Official Building Inspection Report**

**1. General Information**

- Country: Finland
- Municipality: Ranua
- Address: Kauppakatu 23, 97800 Ranua (Invented for reporting purposes)
- Inspection Date: 03.10.2024 (DD.MM.YYYY format)
- Inspector Name: Jari Pekkarinen

**2. Building Overview**

- Type: Public (Community Center)
- Construction Year: 2005
- Number of Floors: Two-story building with a basement level
- Primary Materials: Reinforced concrete structure, timber framing, and wooden cladding typical for Finnish construction in the early 2000s.

**3. Inspection Context**

- Weather Conditions: The inspection was conducted under clear skies with a temperature of -3°C, consistent with the transition from autumn to winter in Ranua, Finland.
- Purpose of Inspection: Routine annual safety and compliance check.

**4. Observations and Findings**

*Structural:*  
The building's structural integrity appears sound with no visible signs of distress or settlement. The reinforced concrete foundation and timber framing are in good condition, showing minimal wear consistent with the age of the structure.

*Electrical:*  
The electrical system is generally compliant but shows some outdated components. Wiring insulation in certain areas appears slightly frayed, suggesting potential future risks. Recommend updating to modern standards.

*Plumbing:*  
Plumbing fixtures are functional with no immediate leaks identified. However, the galvanized steel pipes show signs of corrosion, which may lead to reduced water flow or leaks in the near future. Suggest replacement with more durable materials like copper or PEX.

*HVAC:*  
Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems are operational but less efficient than modern standards. The old heating system (wood-fired boiler) complies with historical use but lacks the energy efficiency of contemporary solutions. Consider upgrading to a more environmentally friendly system.

*Fire Safety:*  
Smoke detectors and fire alarms are present and functional. However, fire extinguishers require immediate replacement as they are expired. Ensure regular maintenance and testing of safety systems.

*Accessibility:*  
The building has ramp access for wheelchair users, complying with A accessibility standards. However, door thresholds need adjusting to meet current guidelines fully.

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

- Update electrical wiring to meet current safety codes.
- Replace corroded plumbing pipes to prevent future leaks and flow issues.
- Upgrade HVAC system for improved energy efficiency and compliance with modern environmental standards.
- Replace expired fire extinguishers and ensure regular maintenance of fire safety systems.
- Adjust door thresholds to fully comply with accessibility guidelines.

**6. Compliance Summary**

The building generally complies with Finnish Building Code (Tiedotuslaki) and accessibility standards (Laki käytössäädintulehduksen ja sen lakeista). However, several areas require updating to meet current safety and efficiency benchmarks.

**7. Conclusion**

The Ranua Community Center, constructed in 2005, is structurally sound but exhibits aging components that necessitate attention to ensure ongoing safety and compliance. Immediate actions are recommended for electrical, plumbing, HVAC systems, fire safety equipment, and accessibility features.
