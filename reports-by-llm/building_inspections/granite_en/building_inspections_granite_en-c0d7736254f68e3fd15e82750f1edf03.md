**1. General Information**

- **Country:** Finland
- **Municipality:** Pieksämäki
- **Address:** Kauppakatu 10, 83100 Pieksämäki
- **Inspection Date:** 30.09.2024 (DD.MM.YYYY format)
- **Inspector Name:** Jari Koskinen

**2. Building Overview**

- **Type:** Public (Community Center)
- **Construction Year:** 1992
- **Number of Floors:** Two-story structure
- **Primary Materials:** Reinforced concrete frame with timber framing and brick veneer cladding, typical for Finnish construction during the early 1990s.

**3. Inspection Context**

- **Weather Conditions:** The inspection was conducted under partly cloudy conditions with a temperature of 12°C and moderate humidity, common for late September in Pieksämäki.
- **Purpose of Inspection:** Routine annual compliance check.

**4. Observations and Findings**

*Structural:*  
The building's structural integrity appears sound with minimal signs of settlement or distress. The reinforced concrete frame exhibits no cracking beyond expected minor hairline cracks.

*Electrical:*  
Wiring is generally in good condition, though some outdated components were noted and recommended for replacement to meet current safety standards.

*Plumbing:*  
Plumbing systems are functional but show signs of corrosion in older metallic pipes, suggesting potential future leaks or reduced water flow.

*HVAC:*  
Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems are operational though less efficient than modern standards. Recommendation for system upgrade to improve energy efficiency is advised.

*Fire Safety:*  
Smoke detectors and fire alarms are present and functional. However, the fire suppression system requires servicing and possible component replacement due to age-related wear.

*Accessibility:*  
The building has ramp access for wheelchair users but lacks an accessible restroom on the ground floor, necessitating improvements to meet current accessibility standards.

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

1. **Electrical:** Replace outdated wiring components to ensure compliance with Finnish electrical codes (FS 3201:2018).
2. **Plumbing:** Inspect and replace corroded metallic pipes to prevent future leaks or reduced water quality.
3. **HVAC:** Upgrade HVAC systems to improve energy efficiency and comply with Finnish building energy performance standards (FS 6490:2017).
4. **Fire Safety:** Service the fire suppression system, including replacement of aging components to maintain compliance with FS 3501:2019.
5. **Accessibility:** Install an accessible restroom on the ground floor to meet Finnish accessibility requirements outlined in FS 6480:2017.

**6. Compliance Summary**

The building generally complies with current Finnish building regulations, notwithstanding several areas identified for improvement or direct non-compliance (electrical wiring, fire safety system servicing, and accessibility features). Immediate attention to these issues is recommended to ensure ongoing compliance and occupant safety.

**7. Conclusion**

Upon completion of the routine inspection on 30.09.2024, the Pieksämäki Community Center demonstrates satisfactory structural integrity but requires updates in electrical systems, plumbing, HVAC, fire safety measures, and accessibility features to meet contemporary standards and regulations. It is recommended that these issues be addressed promptly to maintain a safe and compliant public facility.
