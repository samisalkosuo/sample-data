**2. Building Overview**

- Type: Public (Community Center)
- Construction Year: 2014
- Number of Floors: Two-story building with a basement level
- Primary Materials: Reinforced concrete frame, timber framing for interior walls, and wooden roof construction typical for Finnish architecture, clad in weathering steel panels for durability.

**3. Inspection Context**

- Weather Conditions: The inspection was conducted under partly cloudy conditions with a temperature of -5Â°C, common for late February in Paltamo's mild winter climate.
- Purpose of Inspection: Routine annual safety and compliance check.

**4. Observations and Findings**

*Structural:*  
The building frame exhibits minor signs of settlement consistent with its age, with no immediate structural concerns noted. The foundation appears sound, and there is adequate drainage around the perimeter to mitigate water ingress.

*Electrical:*  
Wiring is up-to-date and compliant with current Finnish electrical codes (FS 34-010-S). All outlets and switches function correctly, and ground fault circuit interrupters (GFCIs) are installed in required areas such as kitchens and bathrooms.

*Plumbing:*  
Plumbing systems show no leaks or signs of corrosion. Water supply lines are copper, and drainage is PVC, both in good condition. The water heater, a modern condensing model, operates efficiently.

*HVAC:*  
The heating system, a high-efficiency gas-fired boiler with underfloor radiant heating, functions properly. Ventilation is provided by a mechanical heat recovery system, ensuring good indoor air quality.

*Fire Safety:*  
Smoke detectors and fire alarms are present on each floor and in common areas, all functioning correctly. Fire doors are intact and self-closing. The building has adequate fire escape routes marked clearly.

*Accessibility:*  
The community center complies with Finnish accessibility standards (Laki 735/2011), including ramp access, accessible restrooms, and maneuvering space in common areas.

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

- **Issue:** Minor peeling of weathering steel panels on the exterior, primarily on south-facing elevations.
  - **Recommendation:** Schedule repainting or application of protective coatings to prevent further degradation.

- **Issue:** A few tiles in the basement area show signs of moisture intrusion and efflorescence.
  - **Recommendation:** Investigate and address potential water ingress points, possibly through improved drainage or waterproofing measures.

**6. Compliance Summary**

The building generally complies with Finnish building regulations (Tiedotuslaki 948/1997) concerning structural integrity, safety, accessibility, and energy efficiency. Minor deviations noted are not critical and can be rectified through scheduled maintenance and minor repairs.

**7. Conclusion**

The Paltamo Community Center, located at Kauppakatu 23, demonstrates satisfactory condition for a structure of its age and construction materials. Routine maintenance addressing identified issues will ensure continued compliance and safety.
