**Official Building Inspection Report**

**1. General Information**

- Country: Finland  
- Municipality: Karvia  
- Address: Industrial Park Kauppakeskus, Karvia  
- Inspection Date: 27.07.2025  
- Inspector Name: Jari Pekka Hietanen

**2. Building Overview**

- Type: Industrial  
- Construction Year: 1985  
- Number of Floors: Two-story structure with a mezzanine level  
- Primary Materials: Reinforced concrete frame, timber framing for interior partitions, and metal cladding on exterior walls.

**3. Inspection Context**

- Weather Conditions: The inspection was conducted under partly cloudy skies with temperatures around 18°C (64°F), typical for a midsummer day in Finland.  
- Purpose of Inspection: Routine safety and compliance check prior to planned maintenance.

**4. Observations and Findings**

*Structural:*  
- Foundation: Generally sound, with minor cracking observed consistent with age and settlement.  
- Load-bearing elements: Reinforced concrete beams and columns show signs of corrosion at some contact points with mild steel reinforcement.  

*Electrical:*  
- Wiring: Outdated knob-and-tube wiring in older sections, partially updated with modern cabling in recent additions.  
- Electrical panel: Adequate capacity but shows signs of wear and could benefit from an upgrade to meet current safety standards.  

*Plumbing:*  
- Water supply lines: Galvanized steel pipes exhibit rust and mineral buildup, suggesting potential for reduced flow or leaks.  
- Drainage system: Functional but with some signs of root intrusion in older sections requiring monitoring.  

*HVAC:*  
- Heating system: Old radiators powered by a vintage boiler; efficiency is low and maintenance history is sparse.  
- Cooling system: Nonexistent, typical for the era; consideration should be given to modern climate control solutions.  

*Fire Safety:*  
- Fire alarm system: Absent or nonfunctional; immediate installation is recommended per current regulations.  
- Fire extinguishers: Several outdated and expired, requiring replacement.  

*Accessibility:*  
- Access for persons with disabilities: Limited, with no ramps or elevators present, necessitating improvements to meet ADA standards.

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

1. Address foundation cracks with epoxy injection to prevent further deterioration.  
2. Upgrade electrical system to modern standards, replacing outdated wiring and panel.  
3. Replace corroded sections of reinforced steel and inspect for further structural integrity issues.  
4. Update plumbing with new pipes to mitigate flow issues and potential leaks.  
5. Install a modern HVAC system for improved energy efficiency and climate control.  
6. Equip the building with a functional fire alarm system and replace expired fire extinguishers.  
7. Implement accessibility improvements, including ramps and potentially an elevator, to ensure compliance with disability access laws.

**6. Compliance Summary**

The building demonstrates partial compliance with current Finnish building codes, particularly concerning electrical systems, plumbing, fire safety, and accessibility. Significant upgrades are necessary across multiple systems to meet contemporary standards and ensure occupant safety.

**7. Conclusion**

This industrial facility in Karvia, constructed in 1985, requires comprehensive modernization to align with current Finnish building regulations and safety protocols. Immediate attention is advised for electrical, plumbing, HVAC, fire safety, and accessibility issues. Further inspections post-remediation are recommended to ensure full compliance.
