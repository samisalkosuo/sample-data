The structural integrity of the building appears sound with no visible signs of settlement or distress. The reinforced concrete frame shows minor surface cracking, typical for age-related wear but not indicative of structural compromise.

*Electrical:*  
The electrical system is generally compliant with current standards, though some older wiring in less accessible areas may benefit from upgrading to meet modern safety codes.

*Plumbing:*  
Plumbing fixtures are in good condition, but there are signs of minor corrosion in exposed copper pipes, suggesting potential future leaks if addressed proactively.

*HVAC:*  
The heating system (district heating connection) is functioning correctly. The air conditioning unit shows some wear and could be more efficient; consideration for modernization or maintenance is advised.

*Fire Safety:*  
Smoke detectors are present on each floor, but battery levels need checking and replacement as per manufacturer recommendations. Fire extinguishers are adequately placed but require inspection and possible recharging.

*Accessibility:*  
The building has ramp access for wheelchair users, complying with accessibility standards. However, door thresholds could be modified to ensure smooth transitions for mobility aids.
