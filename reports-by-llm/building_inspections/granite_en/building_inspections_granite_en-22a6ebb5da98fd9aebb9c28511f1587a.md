**Official Building Inspection Report**

**1. General Information**

- Country: Finland
- Municipality: Enonkoski
- Address: Kauppakatu 23, 47100 Enonkoski, Finland
- Inspection Date: 09.02.2025 (DD.MM.YYYY)
- Inspector Name: Jari Pekka Hietanen

**2. Building Overview**

- Type: Commercial (Office Space)
- Construction Year: 1970
- Number of Floors: 3
- Primary Materials: Reinforced concrete structure with brick facade and timber interior finishes

**3. Inspection Context**

Weather conditions on the inspection date were mild for late winter, with temperatures around -5Â°C and light snowfall. The purpose of this routine inspection was to assess the overall condition of the building for compliance with current safety standards and to identify any necessary maintenance or renovation needs.

**4. Observations and Findings**

- **Structural**: The reinforced concrete structure showed minor signs of cracking, consistent with age and typical wear in Finnish buildings from that era. No immediate structural concerns were identified.
- **Electrical**: Wiring appeared outdated; non-metallic sheathed cables were present, which are no longer compliant with current Finnish electrical codes (KS-E 1027).
- **Plumbing**: Copper pipes showed signs of corrosion, particularly in older sections. Some fixtures required replacement due to leaks and reduced water flow.
- **HVAC**: The heating system, a traditional radiator system fueled by district heating, functioned adequately but lacked modern efficiency standards. Insulation around pipes could be improved for better energy conservation.
- **Fire Safety**: Fire alarms were present and functional; however, the sprinkler system was absent, which is now a mandatory requirement under Finnish building codes (KS-T 1015).
- **Accessibility**: The building did not meet current accessibility standards for individuals with disabilities, lacking ramps and elevator provisions as required by KS-H 2015.

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

- **Electrical**: Upgrade wiring to comply with KS-E 1027, replacing non-metallic sheathed cables with modern alternatives.
- **Plumbing**: Replace corroded copper pipes; consider installing a water softener to mitigate future mineral buildup issues.
- **HVAC**: Evaluate options for retrofitting the heating system to meet contemporary energy efficiency standards, possibly including insulation upgrades and considering alternative heating solutions like heat pumps.
- **Fire Safety**: Install a sprinkler system in accordance with KS-T 1015 to ensure comprehensive fire protection.
- **Accessibility**: Implement modifications such as installing ramps, elevators, and accessible restrooms to comply with KS-H 2015 standards.

**6. Compliance Summary**

The building demonstrates partial compliance with current Finnish building regulations (KS series). While the structural integrity is satisfactory, significant discrepancies exist in electrical systems, plumbing, HVAC efficiency, fire safety measures, and accessibility features. Immediate attention to these areas is recommended for full compliance.

**7. Conclusion**

Upon completion of this inspection on 09.02.2025, the commercial office space at Kauppakatu 23 in Enonkoski, Finland, was found to require substantial updates to meet contemporary safety and accessibility standards. Immediate action is advised for electrical, plumbing, HVAC systems, fire protection, and accessibility modifications to ensure compliance with relevant Finnish building codes (KS-E 1027, KS-T 1015, KS-H 2015).
