**4. Observations and Findings**

*Structural:*  
The building's structural integrity appears sound with minimal signs of settlement or distress. The reinforced concrete frame shows standard wear consistent with its age, no cracking exceeding acceptable limits was observed.

*Electrical:*  
The electrical system is outdated and requires upgrading to meet current safety standards. Wiring insulation deterioration is evident in some areas, posing a fire hazard. The main panel shows signs of corrosion, necessitating replacement.

*Plumbing:*  
Plumbing fixtures are generally functional but show evidence of lead-based soldering, which needs immediate attention due to health risks. Several pipes exhibit rust and minor leaks requiring repair or replacement.

*HVAC:*  
Heating system (oil-fired boiler) operates adequately but lacks modern efficiency standards. Ductwork insulation is inadequate, leading to heat loss. Cooling system (window units) is non-functional and should be replaced with central air conditioning if renovation plans include improving comfort levels.

*Fire Safety:*  
Smoke detectors are present but some are outdated and require replacement. Fire extinguishers are located appropriately but one is expired, needing immediate attention. Emergency exits are clearly marked but one exit door's lock mechanism is faulty.

*Accessibility:*  
The building has limited accessibility features; ramp access to the main entrance is absent, and interior navigation lacks wheelchair-friendly adjustments.

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

1. **Electrical System Upgrade:** Replace outdated wiring and upgrade electrical panel to meet current safety codes.
2. **Plumbing Replacement:** Remove lead-based soldering and replace corroded pipes to ensure safe potable water supply.
3. **HVAC Modernization:** Install energy-efficient heating and cooling systems, improve ductwork insulation for better thermal performance.
4. **Fire Safety Enhancement:** Replace outdated smoke detectors and expired fire extinguishers; repair faulty exit door lock mechanism.
5. **Accessibility Improvements:** Install ramp access at the main entrance and retrofit interior spaces to meet accessibility standards.

**6. Compliance Summary**

The building partially complies with current Finnish building regulations, particularly concerning structural integrity and fire safety basics. However, significant non-compliance exists in electrical systems, plumbing, HVAC efficiency, and accessibility features. Immediate attention to these areas is recommended to ensure safety and legal adherence.

**7. Conclusion**

This inspection reveals that while the structural framework of the community center remains sound for its age, various critical systems require comprehensive upgrades to meet contemporary standards and regulations. It is strongly advised to address electrical, plumbing, HVAC, fire safety, and accessibility issues promptly to ensure public safety and compliance with Finnish building codes.
