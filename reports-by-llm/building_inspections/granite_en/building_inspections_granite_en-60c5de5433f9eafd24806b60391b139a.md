- Municipality: Lappajärvi
- Address: Kauppakatu 23, 80100 Lappajärvi, Finland
- Inspection Date: 09.08.2024 (DD.MM.YYYY)
- Inspector Name: Jari P. Hämäläinen

**2. Building Overview**

- Type: Commercial (Retail Space)
- Construction Year: 1978
- Number of Floors: Two-story building with a basement level
- Primary Materials: Reinforced concrete structure, brick facade, and timber interior finishes typical for Finnish construction in the late 1970s.

**3. Inspection Context**

- Weather Conditions: The inspection was conducted under partly cloudy skies with a temperature of 18°C and moderate humidity, common for the late summer season in Lappajärvi.
- Purpose of Inspection: Routine annual compliance check.

**4. Observations and Findings**

*Structural:*  
The building's structural integrity appears sound with minimal signs of settlement or distress. The reinforced concrete frame exhibits standard wear consistent with its age, requiring no immediate intervention.

*Electrical:*  
The electrical system shows some outdated components, including non-grounded outlets and wiring that does not meet current safety standards. These elements pose a potential fire hazard and should be upgraded to comply with modern codes.

*Plumbing:*  
Plumbing fixtures are generally functional but show signs of corrosion in older pipes, particularly in the basement area. Leaks have been noted and require attention to prevent water damage.

*HVAC:*  
The heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system is operational but inefficient. The aging units could benefit from modernization for improved energy efficiency and comfort.

*Fire Safety:*  
Smoke detectors are present on each floor but require battery replacement and interconnection for comprehensive coverage. Emergency lighting is adequate but some fixtures show dimming, indicating potential lamp failure.

*Accessibility:*  
The building has limited accessibility features, lacking ramps and elevator access for individuals with mobility challenges. This non-compliance with current accessibility standards necessitates improvements to ensure inclusivity.

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

1. **Electrical Upgrade:** Replace outdated electrical components to meet current safety codes, ensuring grounding and proper circuit protection.
2. **Plumbing Repair:** Address corrosion in pipes, particularly in the basement, to prevent leaks and water damage.
3. **HVAC Modernization:** Evaluate and install energy-efficient HVAC units to reduce operational costs and improve climate control.
4. **Fire Safety Enhancement:** Upgrade smoke detectors to a modern interconnected system with battery backup, and inspect emergency lighting for functionality.
5. **Accessibility Improvements:** Install ramps and ensure elevator availability to comply with accessibility regulations, enhancing the building's inclusivity.

**6. Compliance Summary**

The building generally adheres to structural integrity requirements but falls short in several critical areas including electrical safety, plumbing maintenance, fire safety compliance, HVAC efficiency, and accessibility standards. Immediate attention is advised for non-compliant aspects to ensure the safety and legal standing of the property.

**7. Conclusion**

Upon completion of this routine inspection on 09.08.2024, the commercial building at Kauppakatu 23 in Lappajärvi, Finland, demonstrates a mix of satisfactory and concerning findings. While its structural framework remains sound, several systems require updating to meet contemporary safety, efficiency, and accessibility standards. It is recommended that the property owner address the identified issues promptly to ensure compliance with local regulations and enhance overall building performance and safety.
