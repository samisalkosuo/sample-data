**Official Building Inspection Report**

**1. General Information**

- Country: Finland  
- Municipality: Raahe  
- Address: Kauppakatu 23, 68100 Raahe, Finland  
- Inspection Date: 12.12.2024  
- Inspector Name: Marko Pietilä

**2. Building Overview**

- Type: Residential  
- Construction Year: 1978  
- Number of Floors: Two (ground floor and first floor)  
- Primary Materials: Reinforced concrete frame with timber framing, exterior clad in wooden planks stained for weather resistance.

**3. Inspection Context**

- Weather Conditions: The inspection was conducted under partly cloudy skies with a temperature of -5°C and light snowfall, typical for the early winter season in Raahe.  
- Purpose of Inspection: Routine annual check.

**4. Observations and Findings**

*Structural:*  
The building's structural integrity appears sound, with no visible signs of settlement or distress. The reinforced concrete frame shows minor surface rust, consistent with age and exposure to Finland’s harsh climate.

*Electrical:*  
The electrical system is outdated, featuring a mix of old wiring and some newer installations. There are concerns regarding overfused circuits and lack of ground-fault circuit interrupters (GFCIs), particularly in bathrooms and kitchen areas.

*Plumbing:*  
Plumbing includes both original galvanized steel pipes and more recent PVC sections. Leaks were noted around the main water supply entry point, suggesting potential corrosion or wear.

*HVAC:*  
The heating system is a conventional gas-fired boiler with radiator-based distribution. While functional, it lacks modern efficiency standards and may benefit from an upgrade to reduce energy consumption.

*Fire Safety:*  
Smoke detectors are present on each floor but appear to be of older models. There is no sprinkler system installed, which is in compliance with the building's original design but falls short of current recommended fire safety standards.

*Accessibility:*  
The property has limited accessibility features, with narrow doorways and a lack of ramp access, posing challenges for individuals with mobility impairments.

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

- **Electrical:** Upgrade wiring to meet current safety standards, install GFCIs in wet areas, and consider a partial rewiring project.
- **Plumbing:** Replace corroded sections of galvanized steel piping to prevent future leaks and water damage.
- **HVAC:** Evaluate the installation of a more efficient heating system, possibly including a heat pump, to reduce energy costs and improve environmental performance.
- **Fire Safety:** Install a modern smoke detection system with interconnected alarms and consider retrofitting with a sprinkler system where feasible.
- **Accessibility:** Assess the installation of wider doorways and ramp access to comply with current accessibility regulations.

**6. Compliance Summary**

The building generally adheres to the construction standards prevalent at the time of its 1978 build. However, several areas fall short of contemporary Finnish building codes, particularly in electrical safety, plumbing integrity, HVAC efficiency, fire protection, and accessibility requirements.

**7. Conclusion**

This residential property in Raahe demonstrates a mix of well-preserved structural elements and systems requiring modernization to meet current safety and efficiency standards. It is recommended that the owner consider a comprehensive upgrade plan addressing electrical, plumbing, HVAC, fire safety, and accessibility concerns to ensure compliance with Finnish building regulations and enhance overall living conditions.
