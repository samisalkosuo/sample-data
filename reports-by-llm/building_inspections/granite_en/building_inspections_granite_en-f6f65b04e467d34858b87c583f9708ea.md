- Municipality: Pyhäntä
- Address: Kauppakatu 23, 48900 Pyhäntä
- Inspection Date: 27.05.2025 (DD.MM.YYYY format)
- Inspector Name: Jari Pietilä

**2. Building Overview**

- Type: Residential
- Construction Year: 1982
- Number of Floors: Two-story building with a pitched roof
- Primary Materials: Brick facade, timber frame construction, and concrete foundation

**3. Inspection Context**

- Weather Conditions: The inspection was conducted under partly cloudy skies with a temperature of 15°C and moderate humidity, typical for the transition period between spring and summer in Pyhäntä, Finland.
- Purpose of Inspection: Routine annual check as per local municipal regulations.

**4. Observations and Findings**

*Structural:*  
The building's structural integrity appears sound with minimal signs of settlement or distress. The timber framing shows some minor decay, primarily at window and door frames, which is consistent with the age of the construction.

*Electrical:*  
The electrical system is outdated, featuring a mix of old wiring and more recent upgrades. There are several non-grounded outlets and insufficient electrical capacity for modern appliances, posing potential safety hazards.

*Plumbing:*  
Plumbing fixtures are generally functional but show signs of corrosion in older pipes, particularly in bathrooms and kitchens. Water pressure is adequate, though some faucets exhibit dripping due to worn-out washers.

*HVAC:*  
The heating system, an old oil-fired boiler, functions but lacks modern efficiency standards. The insulation in walls and attic is insufficient, leading to heat loss during colder months.

*Fire Safety:*  
Smoke detectors are present on each floor but require battery replacement. There is a single fire extinguisher, located in the utility room, which should be checked for expiration date and serviceability.

*Accessibility:*  
The building has some accessibility issues, including narrow doorways and lack of grab bars in bathrooms, which may pose challenges for individuals with mobility impairments.

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

- **Electrical:** Upgrade wiring to meet current safety standards, install ground fault circuit interrupters (GFCIs) in wet areas, and increase electrical service capacity.
- **Plumbing:** Replace corroded pipes, ensure all faucets are serviced or replaced for leak-free operation.
- **HVAC:** Consider replacing the oil boiler with a more efficient heating system, such as a heat pump, and improve insulation to reduce energy consumption.
- **Fire Safety:** Replace batteries in smoke detectors, check fire extinguisher expiration, and install additional safety measures like sprinklers if feasible within budget constraints.
- **Accessibility:** Install wider doorways where necessary, add grab bars in bathrooms, and ensure all common areas are navigable for individuals with disabilities.

**6. Compliance Summary**

The building generally complies with current Finnish building codes, notwithstanding some outdated elements that require updating to meet contemporary standards. Specifically, electrical and plumbing systems need modernization, while HVAC efficiency improvements are recommended for compliance with energy-saving regulations. Accessibility modifications align with the Helsinki Region Accessibility Guidelines but require implementation.

**7. Conclusion**

This residential building in Pyhäntä, constructed in 1982, requires comprehensive updates to ensure safety and compliance with current Finnish building codes. Immediate attention is advised for electrical and plumbing systems, followed by a strategic plan for HVAC efficiency improvements and accessibility enhancements.
