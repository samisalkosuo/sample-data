**4. Observations and Findings**

*Structural:*  
The building's structural integrity appears sound with no visible signs of distress or settlement. The reinforced concrete frame meets contemporary standards for load-bearing capacity. Minor cracking observed in the basement walls, attributed to temperature fluctuations and moisture, is considered minor and does not pose immediate structural risk.

*Electrical:*  
The electrical system shows signs of aging, with some outdated wiring identified. While functional, recommendations are made for upgrading to modern standards to ensure safety and efficiency. All ground fault circuit interrupters (GFCIs) tested positive, indicating proper protection against electric shock.

*Plumbing:*  
Plumbing fixtures are generally in good condition, though some corrosion is noted in exposed copper pipes, suggesting potential future leaks. Recommendations include pipe replacement or protective coating applications to prevent further deterioration.

*HVAC:*  
Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems are operational but show signs of wear, particularly the older components. Efficiency could be improved by upgrading to more energy-efficient models, aligning with current environmental standards.

*Fire Safety:*  
The fire safety measures, including smoke detectors and a sprinkler system, are present and appear functional. However, regular maintenance checks and battery replacements for detectors are advised to ensure ongoing compliance.

*Accessibility:*  
The building complies with basic accessibility requirements, featuring ramp access and wheelchair-friendly entrances. Further improvements could enhance accessibility, such as installing automatic doors and elevator upgrades for better serviceability.

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

1. **Electrical System:** Upgrade wiring to current standards to mitigate fire risks and improve energy efficiency.
2. **Plumbing:** Replace corroded copper pipes or apply protective coatings to prevent leaks and water damage.
3. **HVAC:** Consider replacing outdated HVAC components with modern, energy-efficient models for optimal performance and compliance with environmental regulations.
4. **Accessibility:** Enhance accessibility features, including automatic doors and elevator upgrades, to meet or exceed current standards.
