**3. Inspection Context**

Weather conditions on the inspection date were partly cloudy with a temperature range of 14°C to 20°C, typical for early June in Närpiö, Finland. The purpose of this routine inspection was to evaluate the structural integrity and compliance with current building codes for potential renovation projects.

**4. Observations and Findings**

- **Structural**: The reinforced concrete frame exhibits minor cracking, consistent with age and typical for structures of this vintage in Finland's climate. No immediate structural concerns were identified.
- **Electrical**: Wiring appears outdated; non-compliant with current standards. Recommend replacement to meet safety codes.
- **Plumbing**: Some fixtures show signs of corrosion, suggesting the need for replacement or refurbishment. Water pressure and flow rates are within acceptable limits.
- **HVAC**: The heating system (district heating connection) is functional but could benefit from an efficiency upgrade to reduce energy consumption.
- **Fire Safety**: Fire alarm system is present but requires battery replacement and sensor testing as per current regulations. Smoke detectors are installed on each floor, compliant with standards.
- **Accessibility**: The building lacks modern accessibility features such as ramps or elevators, which should be considered for renovation to meet current accessibility laws.

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

1. Electrical system overhaul recommended to replace outdated wiring and ensure compliance with Finnish electrical codes (FS 3201:2019).
2. Plumbing fixtures requiring replacement due to corrosion; consider upgrading to water-efficient models.
3. HVAC efficiency improvement suggested through potential system upgrades or the installation of a heat recovery ventilation system.
4. Fire safety enhancements include battery replacement for fire alarms and comprehensive testing of smoke detectors.
5. Accessibility modifications are advised, including the installation of ramps and an elevator to comply with the Accessibility Act (628/1999).

**6. Compliance Summary**

The building partially complies with current Finnish building regulations (BS 374:2018) and local accessibility laws. While structural integrity is maintained, several systems (electrical, plumbing, fire safety, HVAC, and accessibility features) require upgrades or modifications to meet contemporary standards.

**7. Conclusion**

The industrial building at Kauppakatu 23, Närpiö, demonstrates a generally sound structural condition despite aging elements. However, significant updates are necessary across various systems to ensure safety, efficiency, and legal compliance with modern Finnish regulations. It is recommended that the property owner proceed with planned renovations addressing electrical, plumbing, HVAC improvements, fire safety enhancements, and accessibility modifications.
