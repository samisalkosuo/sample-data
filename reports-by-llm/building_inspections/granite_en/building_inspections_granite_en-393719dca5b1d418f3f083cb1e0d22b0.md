**Official Building Inspection Report**

**1. General Information**

- Country: Finland
- Municipality: Puumala
- Address: Kauppakatu 23, 35100 Puumala
- Inspection Date: 11.04.2025 (DD.MM.YYYY)
- Inspector Name: Marko Heikkinen

**2. Building Overview**

- Type: Commercial (Office Space)
- Construction Year: 1993
- Number of Floors: 3
- Primary Materials: Reinforced concrete structure with brick facade and a flat roof covered with bituminous membrane

**3. Inspection Context**

Weather conditions on the inspection date were mild, with temperatures around 8°C and light rainfall typical for early spring in Puumala. The purpose of this routine inspection was to evaluate the overall condition of the building for compliance with current safety standards and to identify any necessary maintenance or renovation needs.

**4. Observations and Findings**

- **Structural**: The reinforced concrete frame shows minor signs of cracking, consistent with age and typical for structures of this vintage in Finland's climate. No immediate structural concerns were identified.
- **Electrical**: Wiring appears to be original and partially outdated. Some circuits do not meet current safety standards; recommendations include partial rewiring to ensure compliance with Finnish electrical codes (FS 3101).
- **Plumbing**: Plumbing fixtures are generally in good condition, though some pipes show signs of corrosion. Recommend replacing sections of the galvanized steel piping to prevent future leaks and potential water damage.
- **HVAC**: The heating system (district heating connection) is functional but could benefit from an efficiency audit to reduce energy consumption in line with modern standards. Cooling systems are nonexistent, which may be a consideration for tenant comfort in warmer months.
- **Fire Safety**: Fire alarm and sprinkler systems are present and appear operational. However, the fire escape routes require clearer signage and occasional maintenance to ensure unobstructed access.
- **Accessibility**: The building lacks modern accessibility features such as ramps and elevators, which are necessary for compliance with current Finnish accessibility laws (Laki käytössäädintulehdus 2018).

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

- Address cracking in the concrete structure through monitoring and potential reinforcement where necessary.
- Upgrade electrical systems to meet current Finnish standards (FS 3101) by replacing outdated wiring.
- Replace corroded sections of plumbing with modern materials like PEX or copper.
- Conduct an energy audit for the HVAC system to optimize efficiency and consider installing a cooling solution for tenant comfort.
- Improve fire safety by enhancing signage along escape routes and scheduling regular maintenance checks.
- Ensure full compliance with accessibility laws (Laki käytössäädintulehdus 2018) by installing ramps, elevators, or other necessary modifications.

**6. Compliance Summary**

The building generally complies with current Finnish building codes and safety regulations but falls short in several key areas related to electrical systems, plumbing, accessibility, and energy efficiency. Immediate attention is required for electrical and plumbing upgrades, while long-term planning should address accessibility improvements and HVAC system optimization.

**7. Conclusion**

This inspection reveals that Kauppakatu 23 in Puumala, a three-story commercial building constructed in 1993, requires several updates to meet contemporary standards of safety, efficiency, and accessibility. While the structural integrity is sound, neglecting the identified issues could lead to operational disruptions and non-compliance with legal requirements. It is recommended that the property owner engage qualified professionals to address these concerns promptly.
