**4. Observations and Findings**

*Structural:*  
The building's reinforced concrete frame shows minor signs of corrosion at joints, consistent with age and exposure to Finland’s harsh weather conditions. No significant structural deficiencies were observed.

*Electrical:*  
Wiring appears to be in good condition, adhering to 1990s standards. However, some outlets lack ground-fault circuit interrupters (GFCIs), which are now mandated by current codes.

*Plumbing:*  
Plumbing fixtures are functional but show signs of wear, particularly in older sections. Copper pipes exhibit minor corrosion, suggesting potential future leaks if not addressed.

*HVAC:*  
Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems are operational but show inefficiencies typical for their age. Recommendation to assess modernization options for energy savings.

*Fire Safety:*  
Smoke detectors are present on each floor but require battery replacement. Fire extinguishers are adequately placed yet some are expired, necessitating immediate replacement.

*Accessibility:*  
The building has ramp access for wheelchair users, though door thresholds could be modified to ensure smooth transitions, complying with current accessibility standards.

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

- Address corrosion on concrete joints through application of protective coatings.
- Upgrade electrical systems to include GFCIs in all outlets for safety compliance.
- Replace corroded sections of copper plumbing and ensure regular maintenance checks.
- Evaluate modern HVAC systems to improve energy efficiency and reduce operational costs.
- Replace expired fire extinguishers with new units and test smoke detectors.
- Modify door thresholds for ADA compliance.

**6. Compliance Summary**

The building generally complies with 1995 construction standards but falls short of current Finnish building codes in several areas, notably electrical safety, plumbing maintenance, fire safety equipment, and accessibility features. Immediate attention to these issues is recommended for full compliance.

**7. Conclusion**

Upon completion of the routine inspection on 27.02.2025, the commercial office space at Kauppakatu 12, Mäntsälä, Finland, was found to be structurally sound but requires updates in various systems and features to meet contemporary safety and accessibility standards. It is recommended that the property owner address the noted issues promptly to ensure compliance with current regulations and enhance overall building performance and safety.
