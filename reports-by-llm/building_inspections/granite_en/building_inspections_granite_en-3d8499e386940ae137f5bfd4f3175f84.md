**4. Observations and Findings**

*Structural:*  
The structural integrity appears sound with no visible signs of significant settlement or distress. The wooden frame shows minor evidence of past moisture intrusion, currently stabilized.

*Electrical:*  
The electrical system is outdated, featuring a mix of old and newer components. Some wiring insulation shows wear, necessitating replacement to meet current safety standards.

*Plumbing:*  
Plumbing fixtures are generally functional but exhibit signs of corrosion in older pipes, particularly in the bathroom areas. Recommend replacement of affected sections.

*HVAC:*  
The heating system (wood-fired boiler) is operational but inefficient and non-compliant with modern energy standards. Consider upgrading to a more efficient heat pump system.

*Fire Safety:*  
Smoke detectors are present on each floor but require battery replacement, as indicated by low battery signals. Install interconnected smoke alarms for enhanced safety.

*Accessibility:*  
The property lacks features to accommodate individuals with mobility challenges, such as grab bars in bathrooms or ramp access. Recommend modifications to improve accessibility.

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

- **Electrical:** Replace worn wiring insulation and upgrade the electrical panel to ensure compliance with Finnish safety regulations (FS 3101).
- **Plumbing:** Address corrosion in pipes, particularly in bathrooms, by replacing affected sections to prevent leaks and water damage.
- **HVAC:** Transition from a wood-fired boiler to an energy-efficient heat pump system to meet contemporary energy efficiency standards (e.g., FS 3201).
- **Fire Safety:** Install new batteries in smoke detectors and consider interconnected smoke alarms for comprehensive fire safety.
- **Accessibility:** Implement modifications such as installing grab bars, ensuring smooth floor transitions, and exploring ramp options to enhance accessibility.

**6. Compliance Summary**

The property demonstrates compliance with the majority of structural elements but falls short in electrical, plumbing, HVAC, fire safety, and accessibility aspects. Immediate attention is advised for non-compliant areas to ensure adherence to Finnish building codes (FS 3001-3901 series).

**7. Conclusion**

Upon completion of the routine inspection on 30.06.2025, the residential property at Kauppakatu 23, Evijärvi, Finland, exhibits a generally sound structural condition but requires updates in several critical areas to meet current safety and accessibility standards.
