**4. Observations and Findings**

- **Structural Integrity:** The foundation and load-bearing walls showed no signs of distress or movement. The roof structure, including trusses and rafters, was soundly attached with appropriate fasteners.
- **Electrical Systems:** Wiring appeared to be in good condition, compliant with Finnish electrical codes (FS 34-100), and all circuits were properly labeled. GFCI protection was noted in bathrooms and kitchen areas as required.
- **Plumbing:** Plumbing fixtures were functional, with no leaks identified. Pipes were insulated to prevent freezing during Finland's cold winters. The water heater showed signs of regular maintenance.
