**Official Building Inspection Report**

**1. General Information**

- Country: Finland
- Municipality: Ulvila
- Address: Kauppakatu 23, 48100 Raisio (Invented for reporting purposes)
- Inspection Date: 04.01.2025 (DD.MM.YYYY format)
- Inspector Name: Jari P. Lehtinen

**2. Building Overview**

- Type: Industrial
- Construction Year: 1979
- Number of Floors: Two-story structure, typical for industrial buildings from that era in Finland.
- Primary Materials: Reinforced concrete frame with brick and timber cladding, common in Finnish construction during the late 1970s.

**3. Inspection Context**

- Weather Conditions on Inspection Date: Cold, clear day with temperature at -5Â°C and light snowfall recorded earlier in the morning, typical for early January in Ulvila, Finland.
- Purpose of Inspection: Routine safety and compliance check prior to planned maintenance.

**4. Observations and Findings**

*Structural:*  
The building's structural integrity appears sound with minimal signs of settlement or distress. Reinforced concrete elements show standard wear consistent with age, no immediate concerns identified.

*Electrical:*  
Wiring is outdated, predominantly using cloth-insulated cables. Recommend upgrading to modern electrical systems in compliance with current safety standards (Finnish Electrical Installation Code KE-12).

*Plumbing:*  
Galvanized steel pipes show signs of corrosion and mineral buildup, potentially compromising water quality and flow. Suggest replacement with more durable materials like copper or PVC (in line with Finnish Plumbing Code YL-102).

*HVAC:*  
Heating system utilizes an old oil-fired boiler. Efficiency is poor, and emissions exceed contemporary environmental standards. Recommend transition to a modern, energy-efficient heating solution (Finnish Energy Regulation 65/2019).

*Fire Safety:*  
Fire alarm system absent; install a compliant fire detection and alarm system as per Finnish Building Code SP 134. Smoke detectors and fire extinguishers are missing, necessitate immediate provision.

*Accessibility:*  
Building lacks ramp access for individuals with mobility impairments. Install ramps or elevators to meet requirements of the Accessibility Act (Finnish Accessibility Law 629/1999).

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

- Upgrade electrical system to modern standards.
- Replace corroded plumbing with compliant materials.
- Modernize HVAC for improved efficiency and emission compliance.
- Install fire detection and alarm systems.
- Provide smoke detectors and fire extinguishers.
- Ensure accessibility through ramp installation or elevator provision.

**6. Compliance Summary**

The building fails to meet several current Finnish building regulations, particularly concerning electrical installations, plumbing materials, HVAC systems, fire safety measures, and accessibility standards. Immediate attention is advised to rectify these deficiencies.

**7. Conclusion**

Upon inspection of Kauppakatu 23 in Ulvila on 04.01.2025, the industrial building from 1979 demonstrates structural soundness but exhibits significant non-compliance with contemporary Finnish building codes across electrical, plumbing, HVAC, fire safety, and accessibility aspects. 

To ensure safety and legal compliance, it is recommended that the property owner undertake necessary upgrades and retrofits as outlined in the 'Identified Issues and Recommendations' section above.
