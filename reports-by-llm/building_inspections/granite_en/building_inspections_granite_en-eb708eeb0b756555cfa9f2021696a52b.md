- Address: Kauppakatu 23, 68100 Raahe, Finland
- Inspection Date: 01.09.2024
- Inspector Name: Jari Pietilä

**2. Building Overview**

- Type: Residential (Single-family dwelling)
- Construction Year: 1977
- Number of Floors: Two, including a basement level
- Primary Materials: Reinforced concrete frame with timber framing and wooden exterior cladding typical for Finnish construction in the mid-to-late 20th century.

- Purpose of Inspection: Routine annual check as per local municipal regulations.

**4. Observations and Findings**

*Structural:*  
The building's structural integrity appears sound with minimal signs of settlement or distress. The reinforced concrete frame exhibits standard wear consistent with its age, and timber framing shows no significant rot or insect damage.

*Electrical:*  
The electrical system is outdated, featuring ungrounded two-prong outlets and a fuse box instead of modern circuit breakers. Wiring insulation appears intact but may benefit from inspection by a qualified electrician to ensure safety standards are met.

*Plumbing:*  
Plumbing includes galvanized steel pipes, some showing signs of corrosion. Water pressure is adequate, though minor leaks were noted in the bathroom faucets requiring attention.

*HVAC:*  
The heating system, an old oil-fired boiler, functions but could be more efficient. Insulation levels in walls and attic are adequate for the construction era but may not meet current energy efficiency standards.

*Fire Safety:*  
Smoke detectors are present on each floor, though testing revealed one unit to be non-functional. Fire extinguishers are located appropriately but appear outdated; replacement is recommended.

*Accessibility:*  
The property has a ramp leading to the entrance, complying with basic accessibility requirements for individuals with mobility challenges. However, interior doorways are narrower than contemporary standards, posing potential issues for wheelchair users.

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

- Upgrade electrical system to meet current safety codes, including ground fault circuit interrupters (GFCIs) and replacement of the fuse box with a modern circuit breaker panel.
- Replace corroded plumbing sections and consider upgrading fixtures for improved water efficiency.
- Service or replace the HVAC system to enhance energy efficiency and performance.
- Test and maintain smoke detectors, ensuring all units are functional. Replace outdated fire extinguishers.
- Widen interior doorways to meet modern accessibility standards, improving ease of movement within the residence for individuals with mobility aids.

**6. Compliance Summary**

The property generally complies with Finnish building codes as they stood in 1977, with some notable deviations regarding electrical and fire safety systems. While structural elements are sound, several components require updating to align with current regulations and best practices for safety and energy efficiency.

**7. Conclusion**

The residential property at Kauppakatu 23 demonstrates a solid structural foundation typical of its construction era but exhibits areas where modernization is advisable, particularly in electrical, plumbing, HVAC systems, and fire safety measures. It is recommended that the owner schedule necessary upgrades to ensure compliance with current Finnish building codes and enhance overall living conditions.
