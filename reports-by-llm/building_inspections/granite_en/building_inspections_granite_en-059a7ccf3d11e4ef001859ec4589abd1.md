Plumbing systems are in satisfactory condition with no leaks identified during the inspection. Water supply lines and drainage appear to be in good repair, adhering to Finnish plumbing standards (FS 3101:2019).

*HVAC:*  
The heating system, a modern heat pump, operates efficiently. The ventilation system shows signs of minor dust accumulation but functions without issues. Maintenance is recommended to ensure optimal performance and air quality.

*Fire Safety:*  
Smoke detectors are installed on each floor and in habitable areas as required by Finnish fire safety regulations (FS 101:2018). The fire door at the stairwell is present and functional, though its seals could be improved for better air tightness.
