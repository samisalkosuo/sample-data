**Official Building Inspection Report**

**1. General Information**

- Country: Finland
- Municipality: Kokkola
- Address: Kauppakatu 23, 64100 Kokkola, Finland
- Inspection Date: 03.06.2025 (DD.MM.YYYY format)
- Inspector Name: Jari P. Lehtinen

**2. Building Overview**

- Type: Industrial
- Construction Year: 1983
- Number of Floors: Two-story structure, typical for industrial buildings from the early 1980s in Finland.
- Primary Materials: Reinforced concrete frame with brick and timber cladding, common for structures built during that period due to material availability and construction practices.

**3. Inspection Context**

- Weather Conditions: On the inspection date, the weather was partly cloudy with temperatures around 15°C (59°F), typical for early June in Kokkola, Finland.
- Purpose of Inspection: Routine safety and compliance check as mandated by local authorities.

**4. Observations and Findings**

*Structural:*  
The building's structural integrity appears sound with minimal signs of settlement or distress. Reinforced concrete elements show standard wear consistent with age, no immediate concerns identified.

*Electrical:*  
The electrical system is outdated, featuring a mix of old wiring and some newer installations. Recommend replacement of all obsolete components to meet current safety standards.

*Plumbing:*  
Plumbing infrastructure includes galvanized steel pipes which exhibit signs of corrosion. Suggest replacing sections prone to leaks or reduced water flow for improved functionality and longevity.

*HVAC:*  
Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems are functional but inefficient. Consider upgrading to modern energy-saving models to reduce operational costs and environmental impact.

*Fire Safety:*  
Fire safety measures such as smoke detectors and fire alarms are present but require battery replacement and system testing to ensure functionality. Recommend a comprehensive fire safety audit including sprinkler system evaluation if applicable.

*Accessibility:*  
The building lacks modern accessibility features required by current standards, notably ramp access and adapted restrooms. Upgrades are necessary to comply with the Accessibility Act (Finland).

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

- Electrical system overhaul to replace outdated wiring.
- Plumbing replacement of corroded sections to prevent future leaks.
- HVAC system upgrade for energy efficiency.
- Fire safety equipment testing, battery replacement, and potential sprinkler system evaluation.
- Installation of ramps and accessibility modifications to meet current legal requirements.

**6. Compliance Summary**

The building partially complies with contemporary Finnish building codes. While the structural integrity is satisfactory, significant non-compliance exists in electrical, plumbing, HVAC systems, fire safety equipment, and accessibility features. Immediate attention to these areas is advised for full regulatory compliance.

**7. Conclusion**

Upon completion of the routine inspection on 03.06.2025, the industrial building at Kauppakatu 23, Kokkola, demonstrates a generally sound structural condition but requires substantial modernization across various systems to meet current safety and accessibility standards. It is recommended that the owner address the identified issues promptly to ensure compliance with Finnish building regulations and enhance overall safety and functionality.
