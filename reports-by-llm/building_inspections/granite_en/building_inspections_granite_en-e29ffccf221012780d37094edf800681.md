**Official Building Inspection Report**

**1. General Information**

- Country: Finland
- Municipality: Aura
- Address: Kauppakatu 23, 40100 Aura, Finland
- Inspection Date: 11.09.2024 (DD.MM.YYYY format)
- Inspector Name: Jari P. Lehtinen

**2. Building Overview**

- Type: Residential
- Construction Year: 1982
- Number of Floors: Two-story building with a pitched roof
- Primary Materials: Reinforced concrete frame, timber framing for interior walls, and wooden siding exterior cladding typical of Finnish construction in the early 1980s.

**3. Inspection Context**

- Weather Conditions on Inspection Date: Clear skies with temperature at 15°C (59°F), suitable for an indoor and outdoor inspection.
- Purpose of Inspection: Routine annual check for residential property maintenance and safety compliance.

**4. Observations and Findings**

*Structural:*  
The building's structural integrity appears sound, with no visible signs of settlement or distress. The reinforced concrete frame shows minor surface rust but remains adequate for load-bearing purposes.

*Electrical:*  
Wiring is present but outdated; non-metallic sheathed cable (NM-cable) is used, which does not meet current Finnish safety standards. Some junction boxes are overloaded and require immediate attention.

*Plumbing:*  
Plumbing fixtures are generally functional, though some pipes show signs of corrosion, particularly in the kitchen and bathroom areas. Water pressure is within acceptable limits but may deteriorate due to aging infrastructure.

*HVAC:*  
The heating system, a gas-fired boiler with radiator baseboard heating, operates efficiently. However, insulation around pipes could be improved for energy efficiency. The air conditioning unit (window-mounted) is non-functional and should be replaced or removed to avoid moisture issues.

*Fire Safety:*  
Smoke detectors are present on each floor but require battery replacement. There is a lack of fire extinguishers, which are mandatory for residential properties in Finland.

*Accessibility:*  
The building has no significant accessibility barriers noted for typical mobility; however, improvements such as grab bars in bathrooms could enhance safety for occupants with mobility challenges.

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

- **Electrical:** Upgrade wiring to comply with current Finnish standards (e.g., replace NM-cable with modern alternatives). Install additional circuits to alleviate overloaded junction boxes.
- **Plumbing:** Replace corroded sections of pipework, especially in high-use areas. Consider a whole-system inspection and potential partial or full replacement for long-term reliability.
- **HVAC:** Improve insulation around pipes to enhance energy efficiency. Replace the window-mounted air conditioner with an integrated, more efficient system if cooling is required.
- **Fire Safety:** Install fire extinguishers in strategic locations as per Finnish building codes and replace smoke detector batteries immediately.
- **Accessibility:** Evaluate installation of grab bars in bathrooms to meet or exceed accessibility standards.

**6. Compliance Summary**

The property demonstrates partial compliance with current Finnish residential building regulations, particularly concerning electrical systems and fire safety equipment. Immediate attention is required for non-compliant aspects to ensure occupant safety and adherence to legal requirements.

**7. Conclusion**

This inspection reveals a generally sound structural condition of the 1982 residential building located in Aura, Finland. However, several areas require immediate attention to meet current safety standards and regulations. It is recommended that the property owner address electrical, plumbing, HVAC, fire safety, and accessibility issues promptly to ensure compliance and occupant well-being.
