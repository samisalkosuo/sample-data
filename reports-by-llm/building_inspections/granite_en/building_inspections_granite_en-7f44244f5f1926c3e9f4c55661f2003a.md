**4. Observations and Findings**

*Structural:*  
The building's foundation appears sound with no visible cracks or settlement issues. The structural framing shows minor signs of wear consistent with its age, but overall integrity is maintained.

*Electrical:*  
Wiring is presently compliant with Finnish electrical codes (FS 34-010-96), though some outlets require updating to accommodate modern safety standards and device types.

*Plumbing:*  
Plumbing systems are functional but exhibit signs of corrosion in older pipes, particularly in the basement. Recommend replacement of affected sections for improved water quality and system longevity.

*HVAC:*  
Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems are operational but show inefficiencies. Suggest upgrading to more energy-efficient models to align with current environmental standards.

*Fire Safety:*  
Smoke detectors are installed on each floor as required; however, the fire alarm system lacks a central monitoring capability, which is recommended for improved response times.

*Accessibility:*  
The building has some accessibility features such as ramp access to the main entrance but lacks full compliance with current Finnish accessibility codes (Laki 735/2011), particularly in bathroom facilities and kitchen layouts.

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

- Update electrical outlets to meet contemporary safety standards.
- Replace corroded sections of plumbing with new, code-compliant materials.
- Upgrade HVAC systems for enhanced energy efficiency.
- Install a centralized fire alarm system linked to emergency services.
- Retrofit bathrooms and kitchen areas to fully comply with accessibility regulations (Laki 735/2011).

**6. Compliance Summary**

The building generally adheres to Finnish building codes, notably FS 34-010-96 for electrical installations and Laki 735/2011 for accessibility. However, several areas require updates to meet current standards and ensure safety, efficiency, and inclusivity.

**7. Conclusion**

Upon completion of this routine inspection on 18.05.2025, the residential building at Kauppakatu 23, Aura, demonstrates satisfactory structural integrity but requires various upgrades to meet contemporary safety, efficiency, and accessibility standards.
