**Official Building Inspection Report**

**1. General Information**

- Country: Finland
- Municipality: Suomussalmi
- Address: Kauppakatu 23, 89700 Suomussalmi, Finland
- Inspection Date: 23.09.2024
- Inspector Name: Jari Pekkarinen

**2. Building Overview**

- Type: Residential (Single-family detached house)
- Construction Year: 1986
- Number of Floors: Two
- Primary Materials: Reinforced concrete frame with timber framing, wooden exterior cladding, and asphalt shingle roof.

**3. Inspection Context**

- Weather Conditions: Clear skies with a temperature of 12Â°C and moderate humidity, typical for late September in Suomussalmi. The inspection was conducted as part of a routine annual check.

**4. Observations and Findings**

*Structural:*  
The building's structural integrity appears sound, with the reinforced concrete frame showing minimal signs of deterioration. Timber framing is in generally good condition, though some areas exhibit minor wood rot requiring attention.

*Electrical:*  
The electrical system is outdated and does not meet current safety standards. The wiring insulation shows signs of wear, and the circuit breaker panel lacks ground fault circuit interrupters (GFCIs). Recommend replacement of the entire electrical system to ensure safety.

*Plumbing:*  
Plumbing fixtures are functional but show evidence of corrosion in older pipes, particularly in bathrooms and kitchen areas. Suggest replacing corroded sections to prevent leaks and potential water damage.

*HVAC:*  
The heating system (oil-fired boiler) is operational but inefficient. Consider upgrading to a more modern, energy-efficient solution such as a heat pump for better performance and reduced utility costs.

*Fire Safety:*  
Smoke detectors are present on each floor but require battery replacement. Install interconnected smoke alarms with long-life lithium batteries for enhanced safety. Additionally, the absence of a sprinkler system is noted as a deficiency given the building's age and construction materials.

*Accessibility:*  
The property lacks accessibility features such as ramps or handrails, which are essential for individuals with mobility challenges. Recommend installing these to comply with current accessibility standards.

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

- Upgrade electrical system to meet modern safety standards including GFCI installation.
- Replace corroded plumbing sections to prevent leaks.
- Install energy-efficient heating solution (e.g., heat pump).
- Update smoke detectors with interconnected models and long-life batteries.
- Install a sprinkler system for fire safety enhancement.
- Implement accessibility modifications including ramps and handrails.

**6. Compliance Summary**

The property partially complies with current Finnish building regulations, particularly concerning electrical systems, plumbing, fire safety, and accessibility. While the structural integrity is satisfactory, several areas require updates to meet contemporary standards and ensure occupant safety and comfort.

**7. Conclusion**

Upon completion of this inspection on 23.09.2024, it is recommended that the property owner address the noted deficiencies to bring the residence into full compliance with Finnish building codes. Failure to do so may result in safety hazards and difficulties in future property transactions or insurance coverage.
