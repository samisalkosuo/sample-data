**4. Observations and Findings**

*Structural:*  
The building's structural integrity appears sound with no visible signs of distress or settlement. The reinforced concrete frame meets contemporary standards for load-bearing capacity as per Finnish building codes.

*Electrical:*  
The electrical system is generally in good condition, though some wiring shows minor degradation, suggesting potential future concerns. All ground fault circuit interrupters (GFCIs) are functioning correctly.

*Plumbing:*  
Plumbing fixtures are in reasonable condition, with occasional signs of corrosion noted in older pipes. Water pressure is adequate, but some faucets exhibit slow drainage indicative of mineral buildup.

*HVAC:*  
Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems are operational but show signs of age. The heat pump efficiency could be improved, and duct insulation is recommended for energy conservation.

*Fire Safety:*  
Smoke detectors and fire alarms are present and functional across all floors. However, the sprinkler system requires inspection and possible partial replacement due to aging components.

*Accessibility:*  
The building provides wheelchair access via ramps and elevators, complying with current accessibility standards for commercial buildings in Finland.

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

- **Electrical:** Replace outdated wiring sections to prevent future safety hazards.
- **Plumbing:** Inspect and replace corroded pipes to maintain water quality and flow.
- **HVAC:** Upgrade heat pump efficiency and ensure proper duct insulation for energy savings.
- **Fire Safety:** Conduct a full inspection of the sprinkler system, replacing outdated components as necessary.

**6. Compliance Summary**

The building generally complies with current Finnish building codes (Sukupuolteko 2017) for commercial structures, except for specific recommendations under electrical, plumbing, HVAC, and fire safety sections to address aging components and improve efficiency.

**7. Conclusion**

The inspected commercial office space at Kauppakatu 23 demonstrates satisfactory structural integrity and adherence to basic building standards. However, several areas require attention to maintain safety, efficiency, and compliance with evolving regulations. It is recommended that the property owner schedule immediate repairs and upgrades as outlined in the 'Identified Issues and Recommendations' section to ensure ongoing compliance and optimal functionality.
