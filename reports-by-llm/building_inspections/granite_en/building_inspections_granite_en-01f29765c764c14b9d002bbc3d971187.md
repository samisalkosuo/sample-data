**Official Building Inspection Report**

**1. General Information**

- Country: Finland  
- Municipality: Ruovesi  
- Address: Kauppakatu 23, 48100 Ruovesi, Finland  
- Inspection Date: 16.03.2025  
- Inspector Name: Jari Pekkarinen

**2. Building Overview**

- Type: Residential (Single-family detached house)  
- Construction Year: 1987  
- Number of Floors: Two  
- Primary Materials: Reinforced concrete frame with timber framing, brick veneer, and asphalt shingle roofing.

**3. Inspection Context**

- Weather Conditions: The inspection was conducted under partly cloudy skies with a temperature of 2°C and light snowfall. This condition is typical for early spring in Ruovesi, Finland.  
- Purpose of Inspection: Routine annual check as per local municipal regulations.

**4. Observations and Findings**

*Structural:*  
The building's foundation appears sound with no visible cracks or settlement issues. The reinforced concrete frame exhibits minor signs of corrosion, consistent with its age, but does not pose immediate structural integrity concerns.

*Electrical:*  
The electrical system is outdated, featuring a mix of old wiring and some newer additions. There are several instances of ungrounded outlets and inadequate circuit protection, necessitating an upgrade to meet current safety standards.

*Plumbing:*  
Plumbing fixtures show signs of wear, particularly in the bathrooms where corrosion in copper pipes is evident. Water pressure is adequate but there are leaks requiring attention to prevent water damage and mold growth.

*HVAC:*  
The heating system, an old oil-fired boiler, functions but efficiency is low. Ductwork shows signs of deterioration and could benefit from inspection or replacement for improved performance and safety.

*Fire Safety:*  
Smoke detectors are present on each floor but require battery replacement. There is a lack of sprinkler systems, which would be recommended for enhanced fire safety in residential buildings of this age and construction.

*Accessibility:*  
The property has no significant accessibility barriers noted for typical mobility; however, improvements such as installing grab bars in bathrooms could enhance usability for individuals with mobility challenges.

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

- **Electrical:** Upgrade wiring to ground all outlets and install modern circuit breakers to ensure compliance with Finnish electrical codes (FS 3201:2019).
- **Plumbing:** Replace corroded sections of copper piping, seal leaks, and consider installing a water pressure regulator to prevent future issues.
- **HVAC:** Evaluate the efficiency of the oil-fired boiler; consider transitioning to a more efficient heating system such as heat pumps, compliant with Finnish energy efficiency standards (FS 3401:2020).
- **Fire Safety:** Install a sprinkler system and replace smoke detector batteries with long-life models.
- **Accessibility:** Add grab bars in bathrooms to meet accessibility guidelines outlined in the Finnish Building Code (Laki hälytystöelakea 2018).

**6. Compliance Summary**

The property generally complies with current building regulations; however, several areas fall short of recent amendments, particularly concerning electrical safety, plumbing integrity, HVAC efficiency, and fire protection measures. Immediate attention to these issues is advised to ensure compliance with FS 3201:2019 (Electrical Installations) and FS 3401:2020 (Energy Performance of Buildings).

**7. Conclusion**

The residential property at Kauppakatu 23, Ruovesi, exhibits a mix of well-maintained structural elements and areas requiring significant updates to meet contemporary standards and safety regulations. It is recommended that the owner address the identified issues promptly to ensure habitability, energy efficiency, and compliance with Finnish building codes.
