**Official Building Inspection Report**

**1. General Information**

- Country: Finland  
- Municipality: Juva  
- Address: Kauppakatu 12, 37900 Juva  
- Inspection Date: 24.12.2024  
- Inspector Name: Marko P. Lehtinen

**2. Building Overview**

- Type: Industrial  
- Construction Year: 2014  
- Number of Floors: 2  
- Primary Materials: Reinforced concrete structure with a metal cladding facade, typical for modern industrial buildings in Finland, designed to withstand the country's climate.

**3. Inspection Context**

- Weather Conditions: On the inspection date, the weather was overcast with light snowfall, common for late December in Juva, Finland. The temperature was approximately -5Â°C.  
- Purpose of Inspection: Routine safety and compliance check.

**4. Observations and Findings**

*Structural:*  
The building's structural integrity appears sound with no visible signs of distress or settlement. Reinforced concrete columns and beams show minimal cracking, consistent with the age and climate exposure.

*Electrical:*  
The electrical system is generally in good condition, though some wiring shows minor degradation, suggesting potential future attention to prevent overheating risks. All circuit breakers are functioning correctly.

*Plumbing:*  
Plumbing fixtures are in satisfactory condition with no leaks identified during the inspection. However, the water heater shows signs of corrosion and may require replacement within the next few years to ensure efficiency and safety.

*HVAC:*  
The heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system operates effectively, maintaining comfortable indoor temperatures despite the cold exterior conditions. Regular maintenance is recommended to optimize energy efficiency.

*Fire Safety:*  
Smoke detectors and fire alarms are present and operational. Fire extinguishers are adequately stocked but show signs of minor wear, indicating they may need replacement soon. Emergency exits are clearly marked and unobstructed.

*Accessibility:*  
The building provides wheelchair access via ramps and automatic doors at main entrances, complying with Finnish accessibility standards for industrial buildings constructed post-2010.

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

- Address electrical wiring degradation by scheduling a partial rewiring to mitigate fire hazards.
- Replace the corroded water heater to prevent future inefficiencies and potential leaks.
- Conduct regular HVAC maintenance checks to ensure optimal performance and energy savings.
- Schedule inspections of fire safety equipment, particularly extinguishers, for timely replacement.

**6. Compliance Summary**

The building generally complies with Finnish industrial construction codes (e.g., SFS-ISO 14001 for environmental management and SFS-EN 13757 for fire safety in industrial premises). Minor deviations are noted, primarily concerning electrical wiring and fire safety equipment maintenance schedules, which should be addressed promptly to ensure full compliance.

**7. Conclusion**

The inspected industrial building at Kauppakatu 12, Juva, demonstrates a generally sound condition with some areas requiring immediate attention to maintain safety and efficiency standards. It is recommended that the owner arrange for the rewiring of electrical systems, replacement of the water heater, scheduled HVAC maintenance, and inspection/replacement of fire safety equipment components as outlined in the 'Identified Issues and Recommendations' section.
