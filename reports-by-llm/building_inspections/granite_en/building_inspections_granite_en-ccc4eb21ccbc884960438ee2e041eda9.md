Wiring appears to be original and shows signs of wear. Some non-compliant outlets were noted; recommendations for upgrading to meet current safety standards are advised.

*Plumbing:*  
Plumbing system is functional but outdated, with galvanized steel pipes showing signs of corrosion. Recommend replacement to prevent future leaks and potential water quality issues.

*HVAC:*  
Heating system (oil-fired boiler) operates adequately but lacks modern efficiency standards. Suggest exploring renewable energy options for heating, such as ground-source heat pumps, to reduce operational costs and environmental impact.
