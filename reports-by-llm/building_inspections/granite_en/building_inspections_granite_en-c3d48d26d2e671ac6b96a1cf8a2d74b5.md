- Purpose of Inspection: Routine safety and compliance check

**4. Observations and Findings**

*Structural:*  
The building's structural integrity appears sound, with no visible signs of distress or settlement. The reinforced concrete frame exhibits minor surface cracking, consistent with age and climate exposure.

*Electrical:*  
The electrical system shows some outdated components, including non-grounded outlets and insufficient capacity for current usage. Wiring appears in good condition but requires upgrading to meet modern safety standards.

*Plumbing:*  
Plumbing fixtures are generally functional, though some pipes show signs of corrosion, particularly in older sections. Water pressure is adequate, but there are minor leaks requiring attention.

*HVAC:*  
Heating and ventilation systems are operational but demonstrate reduced efficiency due to aging components. Recommendation for system upgrade or maintenance is advised.

*Fire Safety:*  
Smoke detectors and fire alarms are present and functional, though battery backups need replacement. Fire extinguishers are located appropriately but some are expired, necessitating immediate replacement.

*Accessibility:*  
The building has ramp access for wheelchair users, complying with basic accessibility standards. However, interior doorways could benefit from wider clearance to fully meet current ADA-like regulations.

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

1. **Electrical Upgrades:** Replace non-grounded outlets, install ground fault circuit interrupters (GFCIs) in wet areas, and assess the electrical panel for capacity expansion.
2. **Plumbing Maintenance:** Address corrosion in pipes, repair leaks, and consider partial pipe replacement to prevent future issues.
3. **HVAC System Overhaul:** Evaluate current systems for efficiency improvements or full replacement to ensure optimal performance and energy savings.
4. **Fire Safety Enhancements:** Replace expired fire extinguishers, install battery-backed smoke detectors, and consider upgrading fire alarm systems for better coverage.
5. **Accessibility Improvements:** Widen interior door clearances to meet or exceed current accessibility standards.

**6. Compliance Summary**

The building generally complies with Finnish building codes (e.g., Basinskonstruktioperinnöksyvyys - Building Structure Regulations) but requires attention to electrical, plumbing, HVAC, and fire safety upgrades to maintain compliance and ensure occupant safety.

**7. Conclusion**

This report summarizes the findings of a routine inspection conducted on 08.01.2025 at Kauppakatu 12 in Suomussalmi. While the structure remains sound, several areas necessitate immediate attention to meet current safety and regulatory standards. It is recommended that the property owner address the identified issues promptly to ensure ongoing compliance and occupant well-being.
