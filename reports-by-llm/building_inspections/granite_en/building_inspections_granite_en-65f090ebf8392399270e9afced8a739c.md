- Number of Floors: Two-story structure with a basement level
- Primary Materials: Reinforced concrete frame, brick facade, timber interior finishes

**3. Inspection Context**

- Weather Conditions: The inspection was conducted under partly cloudy skies with a temperature of 12Â°C and moderate winds, typical for the transitional period between spring and summer in Kauniainen.
- Purpose of Inspection: Routine annual compliance check

**4. Observations and Findings**

*Structural:*  
The building's structural integrity appears sound with minimal signs of settlement or distress. The reinforced concrete frame exhibits standard wear consistent with its age, and no immediate concerns were noted.

*Electrical:*  
The electrical system shows some outdated components, including non-grounded outlets and older wiring. These elements require upgrading to meet current safety standards.

*Plumbing:*  
Plumbing fixtures are generally functional but show signs of corrosion in older pipes, particularly in the basement areas. Recommend replacement of affected sections to prevent leaks and potential water damage.

*HVAC:*  
The heating system (district heating connection) is operational but less efficient than modern systems. Insulation levels in walls and roof are adequate for the construction era but could be improved with retrofitting for better energy performance.

*Fire Safety:*  
Smoke detectors and fire alarms are present and functional, though some batteries are due for replacement. Fire extinguishers are located appropriately but require servicing to ensure operability.

*Accessibility:*  
The building has ramp access but lacks elevator provision, posing challenges for individuals with mobility impairments. An assessment for installing an elevator or other accessibility improvements is recommended.

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

- Upgrade electrical system to include grounded outlets and modern wiring.
- Replace corroded sections of plumbing, especially in basement areas.
- Service fire alarms and replace batteries in smoke detectors.
- Improve HVAC efficiency through potential insulation upgrades or system modernization.
- Install an elevator to ensure compliance with accessibility standards for individuals with disabilities.

**6. Compliance Summary**

The building generally complies with current Finnish building codes, notwithstanding some areas requiring updates to meet contemporary safety and accessibility standards. Specific non-compliance includes electrical systems, plumbing integrity, fire alarm maintenance, and lack of elevator provision for accessibility.

**7. Conclusion**

Upon completion of the routine inspection on 29.04.2025, the community center in Kauniainen, constructed in 1977, demonstrates satisfactory structural integrity but requires attention to several areas to ensure compliance with modern standards. Immediate actions are recommended for electrical and plumbing systems, fire safety equipment maintenance, HVAC efficiency improvements, and accessibility enhancements.
