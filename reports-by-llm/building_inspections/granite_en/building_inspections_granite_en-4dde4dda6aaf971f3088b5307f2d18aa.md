**4. Observations and Findings**

*Structural:*  
The building's structural integrity appears sound, with no visible signs of settlement or distress. The reinforced concrete frame shows minor surface rust on reinforcing bars, consistent with age.

*Electrical:*  
Wiring is present but outdated; non-metallic sheathed cable (NM-cable) is used throughout. Recommend upgrading to modern wiring standards for safety and efficiency.

*Plumbing:*  
Plumbing fixtures are generally functional, though some pipes show signs of corrosion. Recommend inspection and potential replacement of corroded sections to prevent leaks.

*HVAC:*  
The heating system (gas-fired boiler) is operational but shows signs of age with a few minor leaks in the radiator system. Suggest considering modernization or replacement for improved efficiency.

*Fire Safety:*  
Smoke detectors are installed on each floor, but battery status was not verified during inspection. Recommend checking and replacing batteries as necessary to ensure functionality.

*Accessibility:*  
The building has a ramp providing access at the entrance level, complying with basic accessibility standards for residential properties of its vintage. However, interior doorways are narrower than contemporary standards, posing potential barriers for individuals with mobility impairments.

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

- **Electrical:** Upgrade wiring to meet current Finnish safety codes (e.g., replace NM-cable with conforming alternatives).
- **Plumbing:** Inspect and replace corroded sections of pipework to prevent future leaks.
- **HVAC:** Evaluate modernization options for the heating system, considering energy efficiency improvements.
- **Fire Safety:** Verify smoke detector battery status and ensure all detectors are functional.
- **Accessibility:** Widen interior doorways to meet or exceed current Finnish accessibility standards for residential buildings.

**6. Compliance Summary**

The building generally complies with the 1990 construction codes, though several areas fall short of current Finnish regulations and best practices.

Upon completion of the routine inspection on 07.08.2024, the residential property at Kauppakatu 23, Lahti, Finland, demonstrates satisfactory structural integrity but requires updates in several critical areas to meet contemporary standards and ensure safety and accessibility.
