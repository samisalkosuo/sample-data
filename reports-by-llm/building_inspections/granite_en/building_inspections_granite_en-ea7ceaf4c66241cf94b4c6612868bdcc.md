- Purpose of Inspection: Routine safety and compliance check as mandated by local authorities.

**4. Observations and Findings**

*Structural:*  
The structural integrity of the building appears sound, with no visible signs of settlement or distress. The reinforced concrete construction adheres to Finnish Building Code (HSY 2017) standards for industrial buildings.

*Electrical:*  
The electrical system is generally compliant but requires updating of some ground-fault circuit interrupters (GFCIs) in wet areas, as per the latest Finnish safety regulations (FS 3101).

*Plumbing:*  
Plumbing fixtures are in good condition with no leaks identified. However, the water meter and main shut-off valve require servicing to ensure proper functionality during emergencies.

*HVAC:*  
Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems are operational but show signs of wear, particularly in the rooftop units. Recommendation for maintenance and potential component replacements is advised.

*Fire Safety:*  
Fire safety equipment, including sprinklers and fire alarms, are present and tested. However, the fire door at the main entrance is misaligned and needs adjustment to comply with Finnish fire code (FS 3201).

*Accessibility:*  
The building has ramps and elevators meeting current accessibility standards (Laki 736/2018), though minor adjustments are recommended for wheelchair users at the loading dock area.
