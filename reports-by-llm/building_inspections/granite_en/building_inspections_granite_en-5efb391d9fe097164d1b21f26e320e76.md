**Official Building Inspection Report**

**1. General Information**

- Country: Finland
- Municipality: Finström
- Address: Kauppakatu 23, 80100 Joensuu (Note: This is a fictional address within the municipality for reporting purposes)
- Inspection Date: 27.10.2024
- Inspector Name: Jari P. Lehtinen

**2. Building Overview**

- Type: Industrial
- Construction Year: 2006
- Number of Floors: Two-story structure with a mezzanine level, totaling three levels.
- Primary Materials: Reinforced concrete frame with timber framing for interior partitions and roof construction, exterior clad in weathering steel panels.

**3. Inspection Context**

- Weather Conditions: The inspection was conducted under partly cloudy skies with a temperature of 8°C and moderate winds typical for the autumn season in Finland.
- Purpose of Inspection: Routine annual compliance check.

**4. Observations and Findings**

*Structural:*  
The building's structural integrity appears sound, with no visible signs of distress or settlement. The reinforced concrete frame exhibits minor surface cracking, consistent with the age and typical behavior of such materials in Finland’s climate.

*Electrical:*  
The electrical system shows some outdated components, including non-GFCI protected outlets in wet areas (e.g., bathrooms, kitchenette). Wiring insulation is in good condition but could benefit from partial modernization to meet current safety standards.

*Plumbing:*  
Plumbing fixtures are generally functional, though some pipes show signs of corrosion, particularly in older sections. Recommend replacement of affected segments to prevent future leaks or water quality issues.

*HVAC:*  
Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems are operational but demonstrate reduced efficiency. Insulation levels are adequate for the climate, yet periodic maintenance and potential upgrades to more energy-efficient models are advised.

*Fire Safety:*  
Smoke detectors and fire alarms are present and functional. However, the fire suppression system requires servicing and possible upgrade to ensure compliance with current regulations, including the installation of sprinklers where feasible within industrial zoning.

*Accessibility:*  
The building has ramp access for wheelchair users but lacks an accessible restroom facility on the ground floor. Modifications are recommended to fully comply with accessibility standards.

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

- Upgrade electrical outlets in wet areas to GFCI-protected types.
- Replace corroded plumbing sections to prevent leaks.
- Service and consider upgrading the HVAC system for improved efficiency.
- Ensure fire suppression systems are compliant with current regulations, including potential sprinkler installation.
- Install an accessible restroom facility on the ground floor.

**6. Compliance Summary**

The building generally complies with Finnish industrial building codes (e.g., SFS-ISO 19011 for management system requirements in inspection). However, several areas require attention to meet current safety and accessibility standards fully.

**7. Conclusion**

Upon completion of the routine inspection on October 27, 2024, by Jari P. Lehtinen, the industrial building at Kauppakatu 23, Joensuu, demonstrates satisfactory structural integrity but requires updates in electrical systems, plumbing, fire safety measures, and accessibility features to ensure ongoing compliance with Finnish regulations. Immediate attention to recommended modifications is advised to maintain a safe and accessible environment.
