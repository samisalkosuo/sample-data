**Official Building Inspection Report**

**1. General Information**

- Country: Finland
- Municipality: Ilomantsi
- Address: Kauppakatu 23, 80100 Ilomantsi, Finland
- Inspection Date: 17.04.2025 (DD.MM.YYYY)
- Inspector Name: Jari Pietil채

**2. Building Overview**

- Type: Residential
- Construction Year: 2011
- Number of Floors: Two-story building with a pitched roof
- Primary Materials: Timber frame construction, exterior clad in wood fiber boards, interior walls finished with plasterboard, and roof covered with asphalt shingles.

**3. Inspection Context**

- Weather Conditions: The inspection was conducted under partly cloudy skies with a temperature of 8째C and moderate winds typical for the early spring in Finland's northern regions.
- Purpose of Inspection: Routine annual building maintenance check.

**4. Observations and Findings**

*Structural:*  
The structural integrity of the building appears sound with no visible signs of settlement or distress. The timber framing shows minor signs of natural weathering, consistent with its age and material.

*Electrical:*  
The electrical system is generally in good condition, though some outlets show signs of wear. All ground fault circuit interrupters (GFCIs) are functioning correctly. Recommend replacing worn outlets to ensure safety.

*Plumbing:*  
Plumbing fixtures are in working order with no leaks identified. However, the water heater shows signs of corrosion and should be inspected by a licensed plumber for potential replacement or servicing.

*HVAC:*  
The heating system (wood-fired boiler) is operational but exhibits some efficiency loss, suggesting a possible need for cleaning or replacement of the heat exchanger. The ventilation system functions adequately, though duct insulation could be improved for energy efficiency.

*Fire Safety:*  
Smoke detectors are present on each floor and appear functional. However, there is no sprinkler system installed, which may not comply with current fire safety regulations in some regions of Finland. Recommend consulting local fire codes regarding retrofitting or alternative compliance methods.

*Accessibility:*  
The building has a ramp providing access to the entrance, meeting basic accessibility standards. However, interior doorways are narrower than contemporary standards; widening may be necessary for full compliance with current accessibility guidelines.

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

- Replace worn electrical outlets.
- Inspect/replace the water heater due to corrosion signs.
- Clean or replace the heat exchanger in the wood-fired boiler for improved efficiency.
- Consider improving duct insulation for HVAC energy efficiency.
- Evaluate compliance with fire safety regulations, possibly including installation of a sprinkler system or alternative measures.
- Widen interior doorways to meet modern accessibility standards.

**6. Compliance Summary**

The building generally complies with Finnish building codes as per initial assessment, though some areas require attention to align with current safety and accessibility standards. Specifically, fire safety and accessibility modifications are recommended for full compliance with contemporary regulations.

**7. Conclusion**

This report summarizes the findings of a routine inspection conducted on 17.04.2025 by Jari Pietil채. While the residential building in Ilomantsi, constructed in 2011, maintains structural integrity and functional systems, several areas require attention to ensure safety, efficiency, and compliance with current Finnish building codes. Immediate actions are recommended for electrical, plumbing, HVAC, fire safety, and accessibility improvements.
