**Official Building Inspection Report**

**1. General Information**

- Country: Finland  
- Municipality: Ilomantsi  
- Address: Kauppakatu 12, 80100 Ilomantsi, Finland  
- Inspection Date: 27.01.2025  
- Inspector Name: Jari P. Lehtinen

**2. Building Overview**

- Type: Industrial  
- Construction Year: 2011  
- Number of Floors: 2 (ground floor and mezzanine)  
- Primary Materials: Reinforced concrete structure with timber framing, exterior clad in fiber cement boards, roof covered with asphalt shingles.

**3. Inspection Context**

- Weather Conditions: The inspection was conducted under partly cloudy skies with a temperature of -8Â°C and light snowfall, typical for the early Finnish winter.  
- Purpose of Inspection: Routine annual compliance check.

**4. Observations and Findings**

*Structural:*  
- Foundation: Generally sound, with minor cracking observed in non-structural areas.  
- Load-bearing walls and columns: In good condition, no signs of distress or deformation.  

*Electrical:*  
- Wiring: Mostly up to code, though some older sections show slight corrosion indicative of moisture intrusion.  
- Electrical panel: Functional but requires updating to meet current safety standards.  

*Plumbing:*  
- Pipes: Primarily copper, with some PVC for drainage; minor leaks noted in older sections requiring maintenance.  
- Water heating system: Gas-fired water heater functioning adequately but showing signs of age and potential efficiency loss.  

*HVAC:*  
- Heating system: Older gas-fired boiler with moderate efficiency; recommendations for modernization to improve energy performance.  
- Ventilation: Basic system in place, but could be enhanced for better air quality management.  

*Fire Safety:*  
- Fire alarm system: Present and operational, though components show age and may need replacement soon.  
- Fire extinguishers: Adequate number provided but some are past their service date.  

*Accessibility:*  
- Ramps and doorways meet current accessibility standards for persons with disabilities.  

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

1. **Foundation Cracking**: Monitor cracks, especially during thaw periods; consider sealing minor cracks to prevent water ingress.
2. **Electrical Panel Update**: Replace outdated electrical panel to ensure compliance with current safety regulations.
3. **Plumbing Maintenance**: Address leaks promptly and consider partial pipe replacement to prevent future issues.
4. **Boiler Modernization**: Evaluate replacing the gas-fired boiler with a more efficient model to reduce energy costs and emissions.
5. **Fire Alarm System**: Schedule replacement of aging components to maintain safety standards.
6. **HVAC Efficiency**: Investigate upgrading heating and ventilation systems for improved performance and compliance with modern energy codes.
7. **Accessibility Review**: While current, periodic checks are advised to ensure ongoing compliance with evolving accessibility guidelines.

**6. Compliance Summary**

The building generally complies with Finnish industrial building codes (e.g., SFS-ISO 19011 for management system requirements in inspection). However, several areas require attention to meet current safety and efficiency standards. Specific non-compliance includes electrical panel age, plumbing maintenance needs, and HVAC system efficiency.

**7. Conclusion**

The industrial building at Kauppakatu 12, Ilomantsi, presents a moderately satisfactory condition with aging infrastructure necessitating updates to ensure ongoing compliance and operational efficiency. Immediate actions are recommended for electrical panel replacement, plumbing maintenance, and a long-term plan for HVAC modernization. Further inspections should be scheduled post-remediation to verify adherence to Finnish building regulations.
