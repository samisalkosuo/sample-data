**Official Building Inspection Report**

**1. General Information**

- Country: Finland
- Municipality: Kotka
- Address: Pohjolankuja 42, 02300 Kotka
- Inspection Date: 19.01.2025 (DD.MM.YYYY)
- Inspector Name: Jari Pietilä

**2. Building Overview**

- Type: Residential
- Construction Year: 1984
- Number of Floors: Two-story building with a basement level
- Primary Materials: Reinforced concrete frame, timber framing for walls, and wooden roof construction typical of Finnish post-war architecture. Exterior cladding is vinyl siding, common in maintenance-oriented residential areas.

**3. Inspection Context**

- Weather Conditions: The inspection was conducted under partly cloudy skies with a temperature of -5°C and light snowfall, typical for early January in Kotka.
- Purpose of Inspection: Routine annual check as per local municipal regulations.

**4. Observations and Findings**

*Structural:*  
The building's structural integrity appears sound with minimal signs of settlement or distress. The reinforced concrete foundation and frame show standard wear consistent with the age of construction.

*Electrical:*  
The electrical system is outdated, featuring a mix of old wiring and some newer additions. There are concerns regarding overfused circuits and lack of ground-fault circuit interrupters (GFCIs) in kitchen and bathroom areas, posing potential safety hazards.

*Plumbing:*  
Plumbing includes galvanized steel pipes showing signs of corrosion, particularly in older sections. Some fixtures exhibit leaks, indicating the need for replacement to prevent water damage.

*HVAC:*  
The heating system is an old oil-fired boiler with radiator baseboard heat. While functional, it lacks modern efficiency standards and may benefit from upgrading to a more energy-efficient solution like a heat pump.

*Fire Safety:*  
Smoke detectors are present on each floor but require battery replacement. There is no sprinkler system installed, which is in compliance with older construction codes but falls short of current recommended fire safety standards.

*Accessibility:*  
The building has some accessibility features such as ramp access to the entrance and a ground-floor bathroom; however, interior doorways are narrower than contemporary standards, posing challenges for wheelchair users.

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

1. **Electrical System:** Replace outdated wiring, install GFCIs in wet areas, and consider upgrading the electrical panel to meet current safety codes.
2. **Plumbing:** Replace corroded sections of pipework and address leaking fixtures to prevent water damage and ensure proper functioning.
3. **HVAC:** Evaluate replacement or retrofitting of the heating system for improved energy efficiency, possibly transitioning to a heat pump technology.
4. **Fire Safety:** Update smoke detectors with long-life batteries and consider installing a sprinkler system to enhance fire safety in line with modern standards.
5. **Accessibility:** Widen interior doorways to comply with current accessibility guidelines, ensuring ease of movement for individuals with mobility impairments.

**6. Compliance Summary**

The building generally adheres to the construction codes prevalent during its 1984 build, but several areas fall short of current Finnish National Building Code (TOSI) requirements. Specifically, electrical and fire safety standards have evolved since then, necessitating updates to ensure compliance with present-day regulations.

**7. Conclusion**

The residential property at Pohjolankuja 42 demonstrates a solid structural foundation typical of its era but requires significant upgrades in electrical, plumbing, HVAC systems, and fire safety measures to meet contemporary standards. It is recommended that the owner undertake these improvements to ensure safety, energy efficiency, and compliance with current building codes.
