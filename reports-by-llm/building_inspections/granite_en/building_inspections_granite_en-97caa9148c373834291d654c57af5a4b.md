**4. Observations and Findings**

*Structural:*  
The building's structural integrity appears sound with no visible signs of distress or settlement. The reinforced concrete frame exhibits minor surface cracking, consistent with the age of the structure.

*Electrical:*  
The electrical system is generally in good condition, though some outlets show signs of wear and tear. Wiring appears to comply with current standards, but a few junction boxes could benefit from upgrades for better accessibility.

*Plumbing:*  
Plumbing fixtures are functional, but there are indications of minor leaks in the rooftop plumbing that require attention to prevent water damage.

*HVAC:*  
Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems are operational. The heat exchanger shows some signs of corrosion, suggesting a need for maintenance or replacement soon.

*Fire Safety:*  
Smoke detectors and fire alarms are present and appear functional. However, the fire suppression system requires recertification as per current regulations.

*Accessibility:*  
The building has ramp access for wheelchair users, but handrails on one ramp section are loose and need immediate repair to meet accessibility standards.

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

- Address surface cracking in the reinforced concrete frame with monitoring and potential sealant application if deemed necessary.
- Upgrade electrical junction boxes for improved safety and compliance.
- Repair minor leaks in rooftop plumbing to prevent water ingress.
