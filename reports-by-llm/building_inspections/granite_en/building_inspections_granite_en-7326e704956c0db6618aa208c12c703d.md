**4. Observations and Findings**

*Structural:*  
The building's structural integrity appears sound with minimal signs of settlement or distress. The reinforced concrete frame exhibits standard cracking consistent with age, posing no immediate concern.

*Electrical:*  
The electrical system shows some outdated components, including non-grounded outlets and wiring that does not meet current safety standards. There are signs of potential overloading in certain circuits.

*Plumbing:*  
Plumbing fixtures are generally functional but show evidence of corrosion, particularly in older galvanized steel pipes. Some leaks have been identified, necessitating repairs to prevent water damage.

*HVAC:*  
The heating system (district heating connection) is operational; however, the age and efficiency of the distribution system suggest potential for improvement. Cooling systems are non-existent, which may be a consideration for future renovations.

*Fire Safety:*  
Smoke detectors are present but some appear to be outdated. The fire alarm system lacks integration with modern safety standards, requiring an upgrade. Sprinkler systems are absent; their installation is recommended for enhanced safety.

*Accessibility:*  
The building has limited accessibility features, including narrow doorways and a lack of ramp access, which do not comply with current Finnish accessibility codes (e.g., the Building Act 586/1993).

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

- **Electrical:** Upgrade electrical system to meet current safety standards, including grounding and circuit rebalancing.
- **Plumbing:** Replace corroded pipes to prevent leaks and water damage; consider upgrading to modern materials like PEX or copper.
- **HVAC:** Evaluate the efficiency of the heating distribution system and explore options for zoned heating or improved insulation.
- **Fire Safety:** Install a modern fire alarm system integrated with emergency lighting, and assess the feasibility of sprinkler installation.
- **Accessibility:** Modify entrances to include ramps and widen doorways to comply with accessibility regulations (Building Act 586/1993).

**6. Compliance Summary**

The building generally adheres to structural requirements but falls short in several critical areas including electrical safety, plumbing integrity, fire protection, and accessibility standards. While the core structure is sound, significant upgrades are necessary to meet contemporary Finnish building codes and ensure occupant safety and comfort.

**7. Conclusion**

This inspection reveals that while Kauppakatu 10 in Janakkala maintains adequate structural integrity, numerous areas require immediate attention to comply with current regulations and enhance safety and functionality. It is recommended that the property owner undertake comprehensive renovations addressing electrical, plumbing, HVAC, fire safety, and accessibility concerns promptly.
