**Official Building Inspection Report**

**1. General Information**

- Country: Finland
- Municipality: Taivalkoski
- Address: Kauppakatu 23, 80100 Taivalkoski
- Inspection Date: 02.12.2024 (DD.MM.YYYY format)
- Inspector Name: Jari Pekkarinen

**2. Building Overview**

- Type: Residential
- Construction Year: 1987
- Number of Floors: Two-story building with a basement level
- Primary Materials: Reinforced concrete frame, timber framing for walls, and a standing seam metal roof common in Finnish construction during the late 20th century.

**3. Inspection Context**

- Weather Conditions: The inspection was conducted under partly cloudy skies with temperatures at 0°C (32°F), typical for early winter in Taivalkoski, Finland.
- Purpose of Inspection: Routine annual check as per local municipal regulations.

**4. Observations and Findings**

*Structural:*  
The building's structural integrity appears sound with minimal signs of settlement or distress. The reinforced concrete foundation and frame show standard wear consistent with the age of construction.

*Electrical:*  
The electrical system is outdated, featuring a mix of old wiring and some newer components. There are concerns regarding overfused circuits and lack of ground-fault circuit interrupters (GFCIs), particularly in bathrooms and kitchen areas.

*Plumbing:*  
Plumbing includes galvanized steel pipes, which exhibit signs of corrosion and reduced water flow. Recommend replacement with modern PVC or copper piping to prevent future leaks and improve efficiency.

*HVAC:*  
The heating system, a gas-fired boiler with radiator baseboard heat, functions but shows inefficiencies. Insulation levels are insufficient, leading to higher energy consumption for heating. Recommend upgrading to a more efficient heating solution, such as a modern condensing boiler or potentially exploring heat pump options.

*Fire Safety:*  
Smoke detectors are present on each floor but require battery replacement and interconnection for comprehensive coverage. Fire extinguishers are located but some appear expired; all should be checked and replaced if necessary.

*Accessibility:*  
The building has limited accessibility features, with narrow doorways and no ramp access noted. Recommend improvements to meet current accessibility standards, including widening doorways and installing ramps for wheelchair users.

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

- Electrical: Upgrade wiring to comply with current safety standards, install GFCIs in wet areas, and consider a partial rewiring project.
- Plumbing: Replace corroded galvanized steel pipes with modern materials to prevent leaks and improve water pressure.
- HVAC: Evaluate and upgrade heating system for energy efficiency; assess insulation levels and enhance where possible.
- Fire Safety: Ensure all smoke detectors are interconnected, functional, and meet current safety codes; replace expired fire extinguishers.
- Accessibility: Modify entrances to accommodate wheelchair users, ensuring compliance with Finnish accessibility laws.

**6. Compliance Summary**

The building generally complies with contemporary Finnish residential construction standards but falls short in several key areas, notably electrical safety, plumbing integrity, HVAC efficiency, fire safety equipment, and accessibility features. Immediate attention to these issues is advised to ensure the dwelling meets current regulatory requirements and occupant safety standards.

**7. Conclusion**

This inspection reveals that while the 1987-built residential property in Taivalkoski maintains structural soundness, several critical areas require attention to meet modern safety, efficiency, and accessibility expectations. It is recommended that the owner address the noted electrical, plumbing, HVAC, fire safety, and accessibility concerns promptly to ensure compliance with Finnish building codes and enhance the living conditions of occupants.
