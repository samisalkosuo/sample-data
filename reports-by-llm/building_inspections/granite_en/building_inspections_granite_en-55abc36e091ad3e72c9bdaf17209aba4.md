**Official Building Inspection Report**

**1. General Information**

- Country: Finland
- Municipality: Petäjävesi
- Address: Kauppakatu 23, 37900 Petäjävesi
- Inspection Date: 17.07.2025 (DD.MM.YYYY)
- Inspector Name: Jari P. Lehtinen

**2. Building Overview**

- Type: Industrial
- Construction Year: 1997
- Number of Floors: Two-story structure
- Primary Materials: Reinforced concrete frame with timber framing and metal cladding, typical for Finnish industrial buildings of that era.

**3. Inspection Context**

- Weather Conditions: Clear skies with a temperature of 18°C and moderate humidity, common for the late summer in Petäjävesi.
- Purpose of Inspection: Routine annual inspection to ensure ongoing compliance with safety standards and building regulations.

**4. Observations and Findings**

*Structural:*  
The reinforced concrete frame exhibits minor cracking, consistent with age and typical for structures of this vintage in Finland's climate. No immediate structural concerns were identified.

*Electrical:*  
Wiring appears to be in good condition, though some sections show signs of wear. Non-metallic conduptions are present, which may require updating to meet current standards.

*Plumbing:*  
Plumbing fixtures are functional but show signs of corrosion, particularly in older galvanized steel pipes. Recommend replacement with modern materials to prevent future leaks or contamination.

*HVAC:*  
Heating and ventilation systems are operational but less efficient than modern standards. Insulation levels are adequate for the building's age but could be improved for energy efficiency.

*Fire Safety:*  
Smoke detectors and fire alarms are present and functional, though manual testing records are lacking. Recommend updating to addressable systems with regular maintenance logs.

*Accessibility:*  
The building has limited accessibility features, including a single-level entrance ramp and narrow doorways. Upgrades are recommended to meet current ADA standards for broader usability.

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

1. Address cracking in the reinforced concrete frame with monitoring and potential reinforcement as necessary.
2. Update electrical wiring, particularly non-metallic conduptions, to comply with current safety codes.
3. Replace corroded plumbing sections with modern materials (e.g., PEX or copper) to prevent future issues.
4. Improve HVAC efficiency through insulation upgrades and system modernization where feasible.
5. Implement an addressable fire alarm system with regular maintenance records.
6. Enhance building accessibility by widening doorways, installing automatic doors, and ensuring ramps meet current standards.

**6. Compliance Summary**

The building generally complies with Finnish industrial building codes from 1997, though several areas require updates to align with contemporary safety, energy efficiency, and accessibility standards. Specific non-compliance includes electrical wiring, plumbing materials, fire alarm systems, and accessibility features.

**7. Conclusion**

The inspected industrial building in Petäjävesi, constructed in 1997, demonstrates satisfactory structural integrity but requires various upgrades to meet current regulatory standards. Immediate attention is advised for electrical, plumbing, fire safety, and accessibility improvements to ensure ongoing compliance and occupant safety.
