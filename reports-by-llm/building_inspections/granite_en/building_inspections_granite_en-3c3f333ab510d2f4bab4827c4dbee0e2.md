*Accessibility:*  
The building complies with the Accessibility Act (628/1999) including ramp access, automatic doors, and accessible restrooms on the ground floor.

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

- **Issue:** Minor gaps observed around some window frames requiring weatherstripping to enhance energy efficiency.
  - **Recommendation:** Seal window frames with appropriate weatherstripping materials to prevent drafts and improve thermal performance.

- **Issue:** A few exterior light fixtures lack protective covers, exposing bulbs to potential damage or injury.
  - **Recommendation:** Install protective covers on all exterior light fixtures in compliance with safety standards.

**6. Compliance Summary**

The building demonstrates substantial compliance with Finnish building codes and regulations, including structural integrity, electrical safety, plumbing standards, fire protection measures, and accessibility requirements. Minor deviations noted are easily rectifiable without significant alterations to the structure or design.

**7. Conclusion**

Upon completion of the inspection on 06.09.2024, the Siuntio Community Center (Kauppakatu 23) is found to be in generally good condition for its age and construction year. The identified issues are minor and primarily cosmetic or related to safety enhancements rather than structural deficiencies. It is recommended that the following actions be taken to address these observations promptly:

- Install weatherstripping around window frames.
