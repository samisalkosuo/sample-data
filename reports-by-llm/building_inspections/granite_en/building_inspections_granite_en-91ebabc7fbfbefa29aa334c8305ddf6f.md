**4. Observations and Findings**

*Structural:*  
The building's structural integrity appears sound with minimal signs of settlement or distress. The reinforced concrete frame shows no major cracks, and timber framing is in good condition, albeit with some minor rot at a few connection points.

*Electrical:*  
The electrical system includes modern wiring but retains some original fixtures from the 1970s. These older components show signs of wear and should be updated to meet current safety standards.

*Plumbing:*  
Plumbing consists of galvanized steel pipes, which exhibit minor corrosion. Water pressure is adequate, but there are signs of mineral buildup that could impede flow over time.

*HVAC:*  
The heating system, an old oil-fired boiler, functions but lacks modern efficiency standards. Ductwork shows some leaks requiring sealing to improve performance and reduce energy waste.

*Fire Safety:*  
Smoke detectors are present on each floor but appear outdated. Recommendation is to replace with modern, interconnected alarms for enhanced safety.

*Accessibility:*  
The building has a single-level entry and no significant architectural barriers noted, complying with basic accessibility standards for its age. However, improvements could be made to enhance usability for individuals with mobility challenges.

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

1. **Electrical System:** Replace outdated electrical fixtures to ensure safety and compliance with current regulations.
2. **Plumbing:** Inspect and replace corroded sections of plumbing to prevent future leaks and water quality issues.
3. **HVAC:** Upgrade the heating system to a more energy-efficient model, seal ductwork to improve performance.
4. **Fire Safety:** Update smoke detectors to modern interconnected models for improved safety.
5. **Accessibility:** Consider installing ramps or other accessibility features to meet contemporary standards fully.

**6. Compliance Summary**

The building generally complies with Finnish residential construction codes from its era, noting some areas where updates align with modern standards and regulations. While structural integrity is maintained, several systems require upgrading to ensure safety and efficiency in line with current practices.
