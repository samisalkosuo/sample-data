- Purpose of Inspection: Routine safety and compliance check

**4. Observations and Findings**

*Structural:*  
The building's reinforced concrete frame exhibits minor cracking consistent with age-related thermal movement, posing no immediate structural concern. Timber framing shows signs of insect infestation (wood-boring beetles), necessitating treatment.

*Electrical:*  
Wiring is outdated, featuring cloth-insulated wiring that does not meet current safety standards. Recommend replacement with modern electrical systems to mitigate fire risk.

*Plumbing:*  
Galvanized steel pipes show significant corrosion and reduced water flow. Suggest replacing with copper or PEX piping for improved longevity and efficiency.

*HVAC:*  
The heating system, comprising old oil-fired boilers, is inefficient and non-compliant with modern emission standards. Recommend upgrading to a high-efficiency heat pump system.

*Fire Safety:*  
Smoke detectors are present but lack interconnectivity for comprehensive coverage. Install an integrated alarm system linked to the fire department for enhanced safety.

*Accessibility:*  
The building has limited accessibility features, with no ramp access and narrow doorways, failing to meet current Finnish accessibility codes (MS 13620). Recommend modifications to ensure compliance.

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

- Address wood-boring beetle infestation in timber framing through professional pest control.
- Upgrade electrical wiring to comply with Finnish safety regulations (FS 3101).
- Replace corroded plumbing with modern materials to ensure water quality and flow.
- Install a high-efficiency heat pump system to meet emission standards and improve energy efficiency.
- Implement an integrated fire alarm system connected to emergency services.
- Modify building entrances and interior spaces to comply with Finnish accessibility standards (MS 13620).

**6. Compliance Summary**

The building demonstrates partial compliance with current Finnish building codes, particularly concerning electrical systems, plumbing, fire safety, and accessibility. Immediate attention is required for non-compliant areas to ensure public safety and legal adherence.

**7. Conclusion**

Upon completion of the routine inspection on 13.02.2025, several areas require urgent attention to meet contemporary standards and regulations. Immediate action is recommended for electrical, plumbing, fire safety, and accessibility modifications. Further inspections post-remediation are advised to ensure full compliance.
