**Official Building Inspection Report**

**1. General Information**

- Country: Finland
- Municipality: Salla
- Address: Kauppakatu 12, 99800 Salla, Finland
- Inspection Date: 25.07.2025
- Inspector Name: Marko Pietilä

**2. Building Overview**

- Type: Public (Community Center)
- Construction Year: 2010
- Number of Floors: Two-story building with a basement level
- Primary Materials: Reinforced concrete structure, timber framing, and wooden cladding typical for Finnish architecture, complemented by double-glazed windows to meet energy efficiency standards of the era.

**3. Inspection Context**

- Weather Conditions: On the inspection date, clear skies with temperatures around 18°C (64°F) were observed—typical for the Salla region during midsummer. The weather conditions allowed for thorough examination without interference from adverse weather typical of this northern Finnish municipality.
- Purpose of Inspection: Routine safety and compliance check.

**4. Observations and Findings**

*Structural:*  
The building's structural integrity appears sound, with no visible signs of settlement or distress. The reinforced concrete foundation and framing meet contemporary standards for residential and public buildings in Finland.

*Electrical:*  
The electrical system is generally compliant but shows some outdated components. Recommend updating to modern wiring and circuit breakers to ensure safety and efficiency, aligning with current Finnish electrical codes (FS 3101).

*Plumbing:*  
Plumbing fixtures are in good condition, though some pipes show minor signs of corrosion. Suggest replacing sections prone to leaks to prevent future issues, adhering to FS 2401 plumbing standards.

*HVAC:*  
Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems are functional but could benefit from an upgrade for improved energy efficiency. Consider modernizing to meet current Finnish energy performance standards (FS 3600).

*Fire Safety:*  
Smoke detectors and fire alarms are present and operational. However, the sprinkler system is non-functional and requires immediate attention to comply with FS 2101 fire safety regulations.

*Accessibility:*  
The building has ramp access for wheelchair users, but door thresholds exceed recommended heights under FS 3701 accessibility guidelines. Adjustments are necessary to ensure full compliance.

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

- Update electrical wiring and circuit breakers to current Finnish standards (FS 3101).
- Replace corroded plumbing sections and inspect the entire system for leaks (FS 2401).
- Upgrade HVAC systems for better energy efficiency (FS 3600).
- Install or repair the sprinkler system to meet fire safety regulations (FS 2101).
- Adjust door thresholds to comply with accessibility standards (FS 3701).

**6. Compliance Summary**

The building largely adheres to Finnish building codes, notably FS 2101, FS 2401, FS 3101, FS 3600, and FS 3701, with several areas requiring immediate attention to ensure full compliance. Addressing these issues will bring the community center into alignment with current safety and accessibility standards.

**7. Conclusion**

The Salla Community Center, constructed in 2010, demonstrates good structural integrity but requires updates across various systems to meet contemporary Finnish building regulations. Immediate action is recommended for electrical, plumbing, fire safety, HVAC, and accessibility improvements.
