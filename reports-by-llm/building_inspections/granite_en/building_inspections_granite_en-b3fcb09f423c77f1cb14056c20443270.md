**4. Observations and Findings**

*Structural:*  
The building's structural integrity appears sound with minimal signs of settlement or distress. The reinforced concrete frame exhibits no cracking beyond minor hairline fractures, typical for age-related thermal movement.

*Electrical:*  
The electrical system shows some outdated components, including non-grounded outlets and older wiring. These need upgrading to meet current safety standards.

*Plumbing:*  
Plumbing fixtures are generally in good condition, though some galvanized steel pipes show signs of corrosion, suggesting potential future leaks or reduced water flow.

*HVAC:*  
Heating and ventilation systems function adequately but could benefit from modernization for improved energy efficiency. The boiler shows signs of wear consistent with its age.

*Fire Safety:*  
Smoke detectors are present on each floor, but testing revealed one unit malfunctioning. Fire extinguishers are located appropriately but some appear expired, necessitating replacement.

*Accessibility:*  
The building has ramp access for wheelchair users, though door thresholds exceed recommended heights for full compliance with current accessibility codes.

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

- **Electrical:** Upgrade all electrical outlets to grounded configurations and replace outdated wiring to ensure safety and compliance.
- **Plumbing:** Replace corroded galvanized steel pipes to prevent future leaks and water quality issues.
- **HVAC:** Consider retrofitting the heating system with a more efficient model to reduce energy consumption and costs.
- **Fire Safety:** Test and replace malfunctioning smoke detectors, and ensure all fire extinguishers are up-to-date and strategically placed.
- **Accessibility:** Adjust door threshold heights to meet current accessibility standards for wheelchair users.

**6. Compliance Summary**

The building generally complies with Finnish Building Code (Tiedotuslaki) and local municipal regulations, except for specific areas identified under electrical, plumbing, fire safety, and accessibility that require immediate attention to ensure full compliance.

**7. Conclusion**

Upon completion of the routine inspection on 04.10.2024, the community center in Hollola demonstrates satisfactory structural integrity but requires updates in several systems to meet contemporary safety and accessibility standards. Immediate action is recommended for electrical, plumbing, fire safety, and accessibility improvements to ensure ongoing compliance and occupant safety.
