**Official Building Inspection Report**

**1. General Information**

- Country: Finland
- Municipality: Pieksämäki
- Address: Kauppakatu 23, 87100 Pieksämäki, Finland
- Inspection Date: 07.10.2024 (DD.MM.YYYY)
- Inspector Name: Jari Heikkinen

**2. Building Overview**

- Type: Industrial
- Construction Year: 1975
- Number of Floors: Two-story structure
- Primary Materials: Reinforced concrete frame with timber flooring and brick facade

**3. Inspection Context**

Weather conditions on the inspection date were mild for late October in Pieksämäki, Finland, with temperatures around 5°C and light rainfall. The purpose of this routine inspection was to evaluate the structural integrity and compliance with current building codes for potential renovation projects.

**4. Observations and Findings**

- **Structural**: The reinforced concrete frame shows signs of minor cracking, consistent with age and typical weather exposure in Finland's climate. No immediate concerns were identified that compromise structural integrity.
- **Electrical**: Wiring appears outdated; non-compliant with current safety standards. Some circuits show overheating potential due to insufficient capacity for modern industrial loads.
- **Plumbing**: Galvanized steel pipes exhibit signs of corrosion, leading to reduced water flow in some areas. Recommend replacement to prevent future leaks and ensure adequate pressure.
- **HVAC**: The heating system (oil-fired boiler) is functional but inefficient. Suggest upgrading to a more modern, energy-saving solution like heat pump technology.
- **Fire Safety**: Fire alarm system is present but outdated; requires updating and integration with modern fire detection systems for compliance.
- **Accessibility**: The building lacks ramp access for individuals with mobility impairments as per current Finnish accessibility standards (e.g., Act on the Promotion of Equal Rights and to Prevent Discrimination because of Disability).

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

1. **Electrical**: Upgrade wiring to meet current safety standards, install additional circuits to support modern industrial use.
2. **Plumbing**: Replace corroded steel pipes with compliant materials (e.g., PEX or copper) to ensure proper water supply and prevent leaks.
3. **HVAC**: Transition from oil-fired boiler to an energy-efficient heat pump system for compliance and cost savings.
4. **Fire Safety**: Update fire alarm system, including installation of modern detectors and integration with a centralized monitoring service.
5. **Accessibility**: Install ramps and ensure all entrances comply with Finnish accessibility laws (Act 586/1996).

**6. Compliance Summary**

The building partially complies with current Finnish building regulations, particularly concerning electrical systems, plumbing, HVAC, fire safety, and accessibility. While the structural integrity is satisfactory, several areas require significant updates to meet contemporary standards and legal requirements.

**7. Conclusion**

Upon completion of this routine inspection on 07.10.2024, it is evident that while the industrial building at Kauppakatu 23 retains a sound structural frame, numerous systems require modernization to ensure safety, efficiency, and legal compliance. Immediate attention should be given to electrical, plumbing, HVAC upgrades, fire safety improvements, and accessibility modifications.
