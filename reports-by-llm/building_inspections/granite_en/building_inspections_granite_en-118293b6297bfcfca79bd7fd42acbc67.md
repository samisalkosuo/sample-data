- Purpose of Inspection: Routine safety and compliance check.

**4. Observations and Findings**

*Structural:*  
- Foundation shows minor cracking, consistent with age and soil conditions. No immediate structural compromise identified.  
- Roof structure exhibits signs of wear, with some missing or displaced fasteners requiring attention.  

*Electrical:*  
- Wiring appears to be original and in need of upgrading due to outdated knob-and-tube components.  
- Circuit breakers are present but show signs of corrosion.

*Plumbing:*  
- Galvanized steel pipes show evidence of corrosion, potentially leading to reduced water flow or contamination risks.  

*HVAC:*  
- Heating system (oil-fired boiler) functions adequately but lacks modern efficiency standards. Cooling system is non-existent.  

*Fire Safety:*  
- Fire alarm system absent; installation of a modern fire detection and suppression system is recommended.  
- Emergency exits are present but some signs are faded, suggesting repainting for visibility.  

*Accessibility:*  
- Building does not meet current accessibility standards due to lack of ramps and inadequate door widths for wheelchair users.

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

1. **Foundation and Roof:** Schedule a geotechnical survey to assess foundation integrity fully and plan roof repairs/replacement.  
2. **Electrical System:** Upgrade wiring to comply with current safety standards, replace corroded circuit breakers.  
3. **Plumbing:** Replace corroded galvanized steel pipes with modern materials like PEX or copper.  
4. **HVAC:** Evaluate options for upgrading heating efficiency, possibly including a heat pump system.  
5. **Fire Safety:** Install a comprehensive fire alarm and suppression system in compliance with Finnish safety regulations (FS 1012).  
6. **Accessibility:** Modify building entrances to include ramps and widen doorways to meet current accessibility codes (e.g., FS 3701).

**6. Compliance Summary**

The building demonstrates compliance with general structural integrity but falls short in several critical areas including electrical, plumbing, HVAC, fire safety, and accessibility standards as per Finnish Building Code (FS) and related regulations. Immediate attention to the listed issues is advised to ensure safety and legal compliance.

**7. Conclusion**

This inspection reveals that while the 1971 industrial facility in Lieto maintains structural soundness, significant upgrades are necessary across various systems to meet contemporary safety, efficiency, and accessibility standards. It is recommended that the property owner engage qualified professionals for detailed design and execution of the proposed remedial actions.
