**Official Building Inspection Report**

**1. General Information**

- **Country:** Finland
- **Municipality:** Siikajoki
- **Address:** Kauppakatu 23, 45600 Siikajoki, Finland
- **Inspection Date:** 19.02.2025 (DD.MM.YYYY)
- **Inspector Name:** Marko Pietil채

**2. Building Overview**

- **Type:** Commercial (Office Space)
- **Construction Year:** 1984
- **Number of Floors:** 3
- **Primary Materials:** Reinforced concrete structure with brick facade and a flat roof covered with bituminous membrane.

**3. Inspection Context**

- **Weather Conditions:** On the inspection date, the weather was overcast with light snowfall, typical for late February in Siikajoki, Finland. Temperatures were around -5째C (23째F), with moderate winds.
- **Purpose of Inspection:** Routine compliance check as part of annual municipal regulatory procedures.

**4. Observations and Findings**

*Structural:*  
The building's structural integrity appears sound, with no significant signs of distress or deformation in the reinforced concrete frame. The brick facade shows minor cracking, consistent with age-related thermal movement.

*Electrical:*  
The electrical system is outdated but functional. Wiring insulation is in good condition, though some non-compliant junction boxes were identified. Recommend updating to meet current safety standards.

*Plumbing:*  
Plumbing fixtures are generally serviceable, though corrosion in older metal pipes suggests potential future leaks. Water pressure is adequate but inconsistent, indicating possible issues with the main supply line or internal distribution.

*HVAC:*  
Heating and ventilation systems are operational but inefficient. The old heating boiler shows signs of wear, and ductwork insulation is lacking, leading to heat loss. Recommend upgrading to modern, energy-efficient HVAC solutions.

*Fire Safety:*  
Smoke detectors are present on each floor but require battery replacement. Fire extinguishers are located but some are expired; all should be serviced and replaced as per current regulations. Emergency lighting is functional but insufficient in extent.

*Accessibility:*  
The building lacks ramp access for wheelchair users, failing to meet current accessibility standards. An accessible entrance or ramp installation is recommended.

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

- **Issue:** Outdated electrical wiring
  - **Recommendation:** Replace non-compliant components and upgrade the system to meet Finnish safety codes (FS 3101).

- **Issue:** Corroded plumbing pipes
  - **Recommendation:** Inspect and replace corroded sections to prevent future leaks and water damage.

- **Issue:** Inefficient HVAC systems
  - **Recommendation:** Install modern, energy-efficient heating, ventilation, and air conditioning units.

- **Issue:** Insufficient fire safety measures
  - **Recommendation:** Service all fire safety equipment, extend emergency lighting coverage, and ensure smoke detectors are functional with fresh batteries.

- **Issue:** Lack of wheelchair accessibility
  - **Recommendation:** Install ramps or an accessible entrance to comply with the Accessibility Act (627/1999).

**6. Compliance Summary**

The building generally adheres to structural integrity requirements but falls short in several areas related to electrical, plumbing, HVAC efficiency, fire safety, and accessibility standards. Immediate attention is advised for non-compliant aspects to ensure occupant safety and legal compliance.

**7. Conclusion**

This inspection reveals that while the commercial office space in Siikajoki maintains structural soundness, several critical areas require updating to meet contemporary Finnish building codes and safety standards. Immediate action is recommended for electrical, plumbing, HVAC systems, fire safety enhancements, and accessibility improvements.
