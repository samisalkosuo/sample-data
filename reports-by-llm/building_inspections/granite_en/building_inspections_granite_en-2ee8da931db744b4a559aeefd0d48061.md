**4. Observations and Findings**

*Structural:*  
The building's structural integrity appears sound with no visible signs of distress or settlement. The reinforced concrete frame meets contemporary standards for its era. Minor cracking in the non-load-bearing areas was noted, consistent with natural aging processes.

*Electrical:*  
The electrical system is outdated but functional. Non-compliant wiring and fixtures were identified, necessitating an upgrade to meet current safety codes. The panelboard shows signs of wear and may require replacement soon.

*Plumbing:*  
Plumbing infrastructure appears adequate with no immediate leaks or issues detected. However, some galvanized steel pipes show signs of corrosion, suggesting potential future problems requiring replacement.

*HVAC:*  
Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems are operational but inefficient. The age of the systems suggests they may not meet current energy efficiency standards, recommending an upgrade for cost-saving and environmental compliance.

*Fire Safety:*  
The fire safety measures, including smoke detectors and a sprinkler system, are present and appear functional. However, the fire alarm control panel requires inspection and possible modernization to ensure compatibility with current regulations.

*Accessibility:*  
The building lacks modern accessibility features such as ramps and automatic doors, which are required under current Finnish accessibility laws for public commercial spaces.

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

- **Electrical System Upgrade:** Replace outdated wiring and fixtures to comply with current safety standards (Finnish Electrical Installation Code - SF 3410).
- **Plumbing Replacement:** Address corroded galvanized steel pipes to prevent future leaks and water damage (Finnish Plumbing Code - SF 2510).
- **HVAC System Modernization:** Upgrade HVAC systems for energy efficiency and compliance with Finnish Energy Performance of Buildings Directive.
- **Accessibility Modifications:** Install ramps, automatic doors, and ensure all public areas are compliant with the Accessibility Act (627/1999).

**6. Compliance Summary**

The building generally complies with structural aspects but falls short in electrical, plumbing, HVAC, fire safety, and accessibility requirements as per current Finnish building codes and regulations. Immediate attention to the recommended upgrades is advised to ensure full compliance and safety.

**7. Conclusion**

Upon completion of this routine inspection on 18.10.2024, the commercial office space at Kauppakatu 23, Pielavesi, Finland, was found to be structurally sound but requires significant upgrades in electrical systems, plumbing, HVAC, fire safety measures, and accessibility features to meet contemporary standards.
