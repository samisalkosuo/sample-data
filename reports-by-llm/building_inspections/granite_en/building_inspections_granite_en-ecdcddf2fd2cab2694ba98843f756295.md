**4. Observations and Findings**

*Structural:*  
The building's structural integrity appears sound, with the reinforced concrete frame showing minimal signs of deterioration. Timber framing is in generally good condition, though some areas exhibit minor water damage requiring attention.

*Electrical:*  
The electrical system is outdated and requires upgrading to meet current safety standards. Fuse boxes are present instead of modern circuit breakers, posing a fire risk. Wiring insulation shows signs of wear in several locations.

*Plumbing:*  
Plumbing fixtures are functional but show evidence of corrosion, particularly in older galvanized steel pipes. Water pressure is within acceptable limits, though some faucets exhibit reduced flow due to mineral buildup.

*HVAC:*  
The heating system (oil-fired boiler) functions adequately but lacks modern efficiency standards. Insulation in the walls and attic is insufficient, leading to heat loss. The air conditioning unit, if any, is nonexistent or obsolete.

*Fire Safety:*  
Smoke detectors are present on each floor but require battery replacement. Fire extinguishers are located but appear outdated; they should be checked for serviceability and replaced as necessary. Emergency exits are clear but some exit signs are faded and need replacement.

*Accessibility:*  
The property has a single-level entry with no apparent architectural barriers, complying minimally with accessibility standards for its age. However, improvements could enhance usability for individuals with mobility challenges.

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

- **Electrical:** Upgrade electrical system to modern circuit breakers, replace worn wiring insulation, and ensure all outlets meet current safety codes.
- **Plumbing:** Replace corroded pipes, particularly those serving kitchen and bathroom areas, to prevent future leaks and water quality issues.
- **HVAC:** Install a more efficient heating system (e.g., heat pump) and improve insulation to reduce energy consumption and enhance comfort.
- **Fire Safety:** Replace smoke detectors with modern units, check fire extinguishers for serviceability, and install new, visible exit signage.
- **Accessibility:** Consider modifications such as installing ramps or handrails to improve accessibility compliance.

**6. Compliance Summary**

The property demonstrates partial compliance with current Finnish building regulations, notably falling short in electrical, plumbing, HVAC, and fire safety standards. While the structural integrity is satisfactory, significant upgrades are recommended to ensure safety and efficiency.

**7. Conclusion**

This residential property in Isojoki requires comprehensive modernization to meet contemporary building codes and safety standards. Immediate attention should be given to electrical, plumbing, HVAC systems, and fire safety measures. Accessibility improvements are also advised to enhance usability for all occupants.
