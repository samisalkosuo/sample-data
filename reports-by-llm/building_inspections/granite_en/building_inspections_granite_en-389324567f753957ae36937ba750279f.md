**4. Observations and Findings**

*Structural:*  
The building's structural integrity appears sound with minimal signs of settlement or distress. The reinforced concrete frame exhibits standard cracking consistent with age, posing no immediate concern.

*Electrical:*  
The electrical system shows some outdated components, including non-grounded outlets and wiring that does not meet current safety standards. There are signs of minor water ingress in the electrical panel area, necessitating further investigation to prevent potential hazards.

*Plumbing:*  
Plumbing fixtures are generally functional but show evidence of corrosion, particularly in older galvanized steel pipes. Leaks have been identified in both hot and cold water lines, requiring replacement to ensure efficient operation and prevent future damage.

*HVAC:*  
The heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system is operational but shows signs of inefficiency. The age of the system suggests a potential upgrade could enhance energy performance and comfort levels.

*Fire Safety:*  
Smoke detectors are present on each floor, meeting basic fire safety requirements. However, the sprinkler system is non-functional and requires immediate attention to comply with current regulations.

*Accessibility:*  
The building has ramp access for wheelchair users, but door thresholds exceed recommended heights for full compliance with accessibility standards. Adjustments are recommended to ensure full accessibility compliance.

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

- **Electrical:** Upgrade electrical system to include grounded outlets and modern wiring to meet current safety codes. Investigate and rectify water ingress issues in the electrical panel area.
- **Plumbing:** Replace corroded sections of plumbing, particularly galvanized steel pipes, to prevent leaks and ensure proper water quality.
- **HVAC:** Evaluate the efficiency of the HVAC system and consider modernization for improved energy performance and occupant comfort.
- **Fire Safety:** Install or repair the sprinkler system to meet fire safety regulations. Conduct regular maintenance checks on smoke detectors.
- **Accessibility:** Adjust door threshold heights to comply with accessibility standards, ensuring ease of use for individuals with mobility impairments.

**6. Compliance Summary**

The building demonstrates a mixed compliance status. While the structural integrity is satisfactory, several systems (electrical, plumbing, HVAC, fire safety, and some aspects of accessibility) fall short of current Finnish building codes and standards. Immediate attention to these areas is advised to ensure full compliance and occupant safety.

**7. Conclusion**

Upon completion of the routine inspection on 02.11.2024, Kauppakatu 12 in Paimio exhibits a generally sound structural condition but requires significant updates across various systems to meet contemporary standards and regulations.
