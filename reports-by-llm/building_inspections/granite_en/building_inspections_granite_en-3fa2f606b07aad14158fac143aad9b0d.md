**Official Building Inspection Report**

**1. General Information**

- Country: Finland
- Municipality: Liminka
- Address: Kauppakatu 23, 80100 Liminka, Finland
- Inspection Date: 31.03.2025 (DD.MM.YYYY format)
- Inspector Name: Jari Pekkarinen

**2. Building Overview**

- Type: Commercial (Retail Store)
- Construction Year: 1989
- Number of Floors: Two-story building with a basement level
- Primary Materials: Reinforced concrete structure, brick facade, and timber interior finishes

**3. Inspection Context**

- Weather Conditions: The inspection was conducted under partly cloudy skies with temperatures at 8Â°C and moderate winds typical for the transitional season between winter and spring in Liminka.
- Purpose of Inspection: Routine compliance check as per local municipal regulations.

**4. Observations and Findings**

*Structural:*  
The building's structural integrity appears sound, with no immediate signs of distress or deformation. The reinforced concrete frame shows minor surface cracking consistent with age, but these do not compromise the load-bearing capacity.

*Electrical:*  
The electrical system is outdated, featuring a mix of old wiring and some newer installations. There are concerns regarding overloaded circuits and insufficient ground fault circuit interrupters (GFCIs) in wet areas, necessitating an upgrade to meet current safety standards.

*Plumbing:*  
Plumbing fixtures show signs of corrosion, particularly in the basement level. Water supply lines are galvanized steel, prone to mineral buildup and potential leaks. Recommend replacement with more durable materials like copper or PEX.

*HVAC:*  
The heating system (oil-fired boiler) is functional but inefficient. Insulation around pipes and within walls is insufficient, leading to heat loss. Suggest upgrading to a high-efficiency heating solution and improving thermal insulation.

*Fire Safety:*  
Smoke detectors are present on each floor but require battery replacement and interconnection for comprehensive coverage. Fire extinguishers are located but some are expired; all should be serviced and checked annually.

*Accessibility:*  
The building lacks ramp access for individuals with mobility impairments, failing to comply with current accessibility standards. An accessible entrance must be installed to ensure compliance.

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

- Upgrade electrical system to include modern wiring, GFCIs in all necessary areas, and ensure compliance with Finnish safety codes (FS 3101).
- Replace corroded plumbing fixtures and consider switching to more durable materials for future longevity.
- Modernize the HVAC system to improve energy efficiency and comfort; enhance insulation throughout the building.
- Service or replace expired fire safety equipment, ensuring all smoke detectors are interconnected and functional.
- Install ramp access and ensure compliance with Finnish accessibility standards (FS 8710).

**6. Compliance Summary**

The building demonstrates partial compliance with current Finnish building codes (FS series), particularly in areas of structural integrity, fire safety equipment presence, but falls short regarding electrical systems, plumbing materials, HVAC efficiency, and accessibility features. Immediate attention to the identified issues is recommended for full regulatory compliance.

**7. Conclusion**

Upon completion of this routine inspection on 31.03.2025, the commercial retail store located at Kauppakatu 23 in Liminka, Finland, was found to be structurally sound but requires significant upgrades to meet contemporary safety, efficiency, and accessibility standards. It is recommended that the property owner address the noted deficiencies promptly to ensure compliance with local regulations and enhance overall building performance and safety.
