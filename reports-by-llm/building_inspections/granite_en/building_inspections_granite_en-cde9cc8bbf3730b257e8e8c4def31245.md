**Official Building Inspection Report**

**1. General Information**

- **Country:** Finland
- **Municipality:** Konnevesi
- **Address:** Kauppakatu 12, 37800 Konnevesi, Finland (Invented for reporting purposes)
- **Inspection Date:** 03.12.2024 (DD.MM.YYYY format)
- **Inspector Name:** Jari P. Lehtinen

**2. Building Overview**

- **Type:** Residential
- **Construction Year:** 1984
- **Number of Floors:** Two-story building with a pitched roof, typical for residential construction in Finland during that era.
- **Primary Materials:** Wooden frame construction with exterior cladding in vertical planks of larch wood, common in Finnish residential buildings due to abundant local resources. The interior features traditional Finnish white painted walls and pine flooring.

**3. Inspection Context**

- **Weather Conditions:** On the inspection date, the weather was mild for late autumn with temperatures around 5°C (41°F) and light rain. This condition allowed for a thorough examination of exterior elements without significant hindrance from extreme weather.
- **Purpose of Inspection:** Routine annual check to ensure ongoing compliance with current building standards and safety regulations.

**4. Observations and Findings**

- **Structural Integrity:** The foundation appears sound, with no visible cracks or settlement issues. The wooden frame shows minor signs of decay in some areas, which is expected given the age but does not pose immediate structural risk.
- **Electrical Systems:** Wiring is outdated and non-compliant with current standards. Some circuits show overheating potential due to insufficient capacity for modern appliance loads. Recommend replacement of electrical systems.
- **Plumbing:** Plumbing fixtures are functional but contain lead pipes, which pose a health risk. Recommend replacement of all plumbing lines with modern, non-toxic alternatives.
- **HVAC:** The heating system (wood-fired boiler) is operational but inefficient and does not meet contemporary energy standards. Suggest upgrading to a more efficient heating solution, possibly a heat pump.
- **Fire Safety:** Smoke detectors are present on each floor but lack interconnectivity for comprehensive coverage. Recommend installation of an integrated smoke alarm system linked to the mains power supply.
- **Accessibility:** The building does not meet current accessibility standards due to lack of ramps and narrow doorways. Propose modifications to improve access for individuals with mobility impairments, including widening door frames and installing ramps at entrances.

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

- **Issue:** Outdated electrical system
  - **Recommendation:** Replace existing wiring with modern, compliant systems to ensure safety and meet current energy demands.

- **Issue:** Lead plumbing
  - **Recommendation:** Remove and replace all lead pipes with safe, code-compliant materials such as copper or PEX.

- **Issue:** Inefficient heating system
  - **Recommendation:** Install a modern, energy-efficient heating solution like a heat pump to reduce energy consumption and costs.

- **Issue:** Insufficient fire safety measures
  - **Recommendation:** Implement an integrated smoke alarm system connected to the power supply for comprehensive protection against fire hazards.

- **Issue:** Non-compliance with accessibility standards
  - **Recommendation:** Modify entrances with ramps and widen doorways to ensure compliance with current accessibility regulations, facilitating access for all users.

**6. Compliance Summary**

The building demonstrates partial compliance with contemporary Finnish building codes. While the structural integrity is satisfactory, several critical areas fall short of current safety, energy efficiency, and accessibility standards. Immediate attention to electrical, plumbing, heating, fire safety, and accessibility issues is recommended for full compliance.

**7. Conclusion**

The residential property at Kauppakatu 12, Konnevesi, exhibits a generally sound structure but requires significant upgrades in several key areas to meet modern standards of safety, energy efficiency, and accessibility. It is advised that the owner address the identified issues promptly to ensure habitability and compliance with Finnish building regulations.
