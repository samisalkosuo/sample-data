*Structural:*  
The building's structural integrity appears sound, with no visible signs of distress or settlement. The reinforced concrete frame exhibits minor surface cracking, typical for age and consistent with Finnish construction standards.

*Electrical:*  
Wiring is generally in good condition, though some outdated components were noted near the main panel. Recommend updating to meet current safety codes.

*Plumbing:*  
Plumbing systems are functional but show signs of minor corrosion in older pipes, particularly in the basement. Suggest replacement of affected sections to prevent future leaks.

*HVAC:*  
Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems operate efficiently. Filters were cleaned, and system performance was noted as satisfactory for the building's size and usage.

*Fire Safety:*  
Smoke detectors and fire alarms are present and functional. Fire extinguishers are adequately stocked but require inspection and possible replacement due to expiration dates. Recommend a comprehensive fire safety drill for staff and regular maintenance checks.

*Accessibility:*  
The building complies with accessibility standards, featuring ramps, elevators serving all floors, and accessible restrooms. However, door thresholds could benefit from smoother transitions for wheelchair users.
