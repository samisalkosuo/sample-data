**Official Building Inspection Report**

**1. General Information**

- **Country:** Finland
- **Municipality:** Koski Tl
- **Address:** Puistokaari 23, 40100 Koski Tl, Finland
- **Inspection Date:** 28.01.2025 (DD.MM.YYYY format)
- **Inspector Name:** Jari P. Lehtinen

**2. Building Overview**

- **Type:** Industrial
- **Construction Year:** 2014
- **Number of Floors:** Two-story structure, typical for modern industrial buildings in Finland aiming for efficient space utilization and minimizing environmental impact.
- **Primary Materials:** Reinforced concrete frame with exterior cladding in locally sourced, treated wood for thermal insulation and aesthetic alignment with Finnish architectural traditions. Steel roofing is standard for industrial buildings due to its durability and fire resistance properties.

**3. Inspection Context**

- **Weather Conditions:** On the inspection date, clear weather conditions prevailed with temperatures around -5Â°C, typical for early January in Koski Tl. Snow cover was present, which did not significantly impede access or observation but required careful navigation.
- **Purpose of Inspection:** Routine compliance check as mandated by local municipal authorities to ensure ongoing adherence to building codes and safety standards.

**4. Observations and Findings**

- **Structural Integrity:** The reinforced concrete frame showed no signs of distress or deformation, meeting current structural load requirements.
- **Electrical Systems:** Wiring appeared in good condition with proper grounding. However, some older components were identified near the main panel, suggesting potential future upgrades for efficiency and safety.
- **Plumbing:** Plumbing fixtures were functional but showed minor signs of wear, particularly around joints. Recommendation to replace aging components proactively to prevent leaks.
- **HVAC Systems:** Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems were operational though less efficient than modern standards. Insulation quality was adequate for the climate but could be enhanced with updated materials.
- **Fire Safety:** Fire alarm system was present and tested during inspection, functioning correctly. However, fire extinguishers required servicing as indicated by expiration dates.
- **Accessibility:** The building complied with accessibility standards, featuring ramps and elevators suitable for individuals with mobility challenges.

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

1. **Electrical Components:** Replace older wiring near the main panel to ensure compliance with current safety codes and improve energy efficiency.
2. **Plumbing Maintenance:** Schedule a plumber to inspect and replace aging components, focusing on joints prone to leaks.
3. **HVAC Upgrade:** Consider retrofitting HVAC systems with modern, energy-efficient technologies to reduce operational costs and environmental impact.
4. **Fire Safety Equipment:** Service all fire extinguishers and ensure they are up-to-date and readily accessible.
5. **Insulation Review:** Evaluate the current insulation materials for potential upgrades that could enhance thermal performance without major structural alterations.

**6. Compliance Summary**

The building generally complies with Finnish industrial building codes (e.g., SFS-ISO 19011:2017 for management systems of quality and environmental aspects). Minor deviations were noted in electrical, plumbing, and fire safety areas, requiring timely corrective actions to maintain full compliance.

**7. Conclusion**

The industrial building at Puistokaari 23, Koski Tl, was found to be in satisfactory condition with a few areas necessitating attention to ensure continued adherence to safety and efficiency standards. Immediate actions are recommended for electrical, plumbing, fire safety, and potential HVAC upgrades.
