**Official Building Inspection Report**

**1. General Information**

- Country: Finland
- Municipality: Joutsa
- Address: Kauppakatu 23, 37400 Joutsa, Finland
- Inspection Date: 08.02.2025 (DD.MM.YYYY format)
- Inspector Name: Marko P. Lehtinen

**2. Building Overview**

- Type: Industrial
- Construction Year: 1978
- Number of Floors: Two-story structure, typical for industrial buildings from the late 1970s in Finland.
- Primary Materials: Reinforced concrete frame with brick and timber cladding, common for structures built during that period.

**3. Inspection Context**

- Weather Conditions: On the inspection date, clear skies with a temperature of -12Â°C were observed, typical for early February in central Finland.
- Purpose of Inspection: Routine safety and compliance check as part of ongoing municipal oversight.

**4. Observations and Findings**

*Structural:*  
The building's structural integrity appears sound with minimal signs of settlement or distress, consistent with its age and construction materials. Reinforced concrete elements show minor surface cracking, typical for aging structures but not indicative of immediate concern.

*Electrical:*  
The electrical system is outdated, featuring a mix of old wiring and some newer installations. There are concerns regarding overloaded circuits and lack of ground-fault circuit interrupters (GFCIs), especially in areas with potential water exposure.

*Plumbing:*  
Plumbing includes both original galvanized steel pipes and more recent PVC sections. Leaks were noted in the older sections, suggesting replacement is necessary to prevent water damage.

*HVAC:*  
Heating is provided by an old oil-fired boiler with a radiator system. The air conditioning unit appears functional but lacks modern energy efficiency standards.

*Fire Safety:*  
The fire safety measures, including smoke detectors and fire extinguishers, are present but outdated. There's a need for regular maintenance and potential upgrade to meet current standards.

*Accessibility:*  
The building does not comply with modern accessibility requirements due to lack of ramps and insufficient door widths for wheelchair users.

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

- **Electrical:** Upgrade electrical system to include GFCIs, rewire circuits to reduce overloading, and ensure compliance with current safety standards.
- **Plumbing:** Replace aging galvanized steel pipes to prevent leaks and water damage.
- **HVAC:** Evaluate the efficiency of the heating system and consider modernizing for better energy performance.
- **Fire Safety:** Update fire detection and suppression systems, including smoke detectors and fire extinguishers, ensuring they meet current regulations.
- **Accessibility:** Install ramps and widen doorways to comply with accessibility standards.

**6. Compliance Summary**

The building generally adheres to structural integrity requirements but falls short in several key areas including electrical safety, plumbing, HVAC efficiency, fire safety measures, and accessibility compliance. While the core structure is sound, significant upgrades are necessary to meet contemporary Finnish building codes and safety standards.

**7. Conclusion**

Upon completion of this routine inspection on 08.02.2025, it is evident that while the industrial building at Kauppakatu 23 in Joutsa maintains structural integrity, numerous areas require attention to ensure safety and compliance with current Finnish regulations. Immediate action is recommended for electrical, plumbing, HVAC systems, fire safety improvements, and accessibility modifications.
