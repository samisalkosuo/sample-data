### **4. Observations and Findings**  

#### **Structural Integrity**  
- The building appears structurally sound with no visible cracks or变形 in the exterior walls. However, there are signs of wear on the foundation beams due to consistent load over the decades.  

#### **Electrical Systems**  
- The electrical wiring is outdated and requires modernization. There are several receptacles without proper circuit breakers, posing a fire hazard if overloaded.  

#### **Plumbing Systems**  
- The plumbing system appears functional but shows signs of age-related inefficiency. Water pipes in the bathrooms exhibit slight rusting, likely due to exposure over time.  

#### **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC)**  
- The HVAC system is operational but inefficient. The ductwork shows visible dirt accumulation, indicating a need for cleaning or replacement.  

#### **Fire Safety**  
- Fire extinguishers are present but outdated. They do not meet current Finnish fire safety standards and require replacement.  

#### **Accessibility**  
- The property has limited access for individuals with mobility challenges due to poorly lit staircases and doorways. Additional lighting is needed in the stairwells and vestibules.
