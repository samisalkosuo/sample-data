### **4. Observations and Findings**  

#### **Structural Integrity**  
- The building appears structurally sound, with no visible signs of uplift or cracking in the foundation or exterior walls. However, there are minor signs of subsidence near the first floor, likely due to differential settling over the years.

#### **Electrical System**  
- The electrical panel is operational and free from faults. The wiring is well-insulated but shows signs of wear on the terminal blocks. No unauthorized modifications have been detected in the past decade.

#### **Water Supply and Sewage**  
- The water supply system functions correctly, with no leaks or pressure issues. The sewage system is operational, though there are concerns about the age of the pipes (some are 10 years old). A partial blockage was noted near the basement level, which may require attention.

#### **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC)**  
- The HVAC system operates efficiently but shows signs of wear on the condenser coil. No major issues were observed during the inspection, but modernization is recommended to improve energy efficiency in line with current regulations.

#### **Fire Safety**  
- The fire safety measures are adequate for a residential building of this age. All emergency exits are functional, and the smoke detectors and alarms are operational. However, the last inspection of the fire extinguishers was in 2018, and they need to be replaced soon.

#### **Accessibility**  
- The building is accessible to all residents, including those with mobility challenges. A ramp leads to the front entrance, and the staircase has handrails for safe navigation. No major accessibility issues were identified.

| **Issue**                                                                 | **Recommendation**                                                                 |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Minor signs of subsidence near the first floor.                          | Leveling and foundation stabilization services should be commissioned immediately.    |
| Worn-out terminal blocks in the electrical wiring.                         | Replacement or upgrading of terminal blocks to ensure long-term reliability.        |
| Partial blockage in the sewage system near the basement level.             | Immediate clearing of debris from the drainage system is recommended.              |
| Outdated HVAC condenser coil requiring attention.                         | Modernization or replacement of the HVAC system for improved energy efficiency.    |
| Expiry date of fire extinguishers (last inspected in 2018).               | Replacement of all fire extinguishers with updated models.                        |

### **6. Compliance Summary**  
The building generally complies with local and national building regulations, but there are areas where upgrades or maintenance are required to align with current standards. The HVAC system, fire safety measures, and structural integrity fall within acceptable limits, while the electrical wiring and sewage systems require attention.

---

### **7. Conclusion**  
The residential building in question is in good overall condition, with no immediate safety risks. However, several minor issues require prompt action to ensure long-term occupancy safety and compliance with modern building codes. The inspection report recommends scheduling professional services for the identified repairs and upgrades.
