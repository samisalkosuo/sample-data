- **Construction Year:** 2002  
- **Number of Floors:** 5  
- **Primary Materials:** Concrete and brick with wooden beams (common materials for public buildings in Finland during the early 2000s).  

---

### **3. Inspection Context**

### **4. Observations and Findings**  

#### **Structural Integrity**  
- The building appears structurally sound, but there are signs of sagging in the wooden beams spanning the second floor. This is likely due to age-related settling in the substructure.  

#### **Electrical System**  
- The electrical wiring is outdated, with several outlets and circuits exceeding the recommended maximum load for a public facility. Replacing these components is necessary to ensure safety and efficiency.  

#### **Plumbing System**  
- The plumbing system shows signs of wear and tear, particularly in the old water heater and pipes near the foundation. Modernizing this system is essential for optimal performance and compliance with current regulations.  

#### **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC)**  
- The HVAC system appears to be functional but is inefficient due to outdated ductwork and refrigeration units. Upgrading to a more energy-efficient system would reduce operational costs and improve comfort.  

#### **Fire Safety**  
- Fire extinguishers are present but not properly maintained. Additional fire blankets or smoke detectors could enhance safety in case of emergencies.  

#### **Accessibility**  
- The building lacks proper accessibility features, such as ramps for wheelchair access and widened doorways. These modifications are necessary to fully comply with Finnish accessibility standards.

### **6. Compliance Summary**  
The building partially complies with current Finnish building regulations but requires updates to address outdated systems and structural components. The identified issues are not classified as critical but could become significant if left unresolved.

---
