### **3. Inspection Context**  
The inspection was conducted on 09 September 2024 during mild autumn weather in Korsnäs, with occasional light rain. The temperature was approximately 18°C (64°F). The purpose of the inspection was to evaluate the structural integrity and compliance with current building regulations for a commercial property under renovation.

### **4. Observations and Findings**  
- **Structural Integrity:** The building appears structurally sound, but there are signs of wear and tear consistent with its age (40 years since construction). Minor cracks in the foundation were observed during inspections.  
- **Electrical Systems:** The electrical wiring is outdated, with several receptacles operating below their maximum capacity. There are no apparent short circuits or fire hazards.  
- **Plumbing Systems:** The plumbing system shows signs of mildew and stains on pipes due to inadequate drainage from a partial roof drain. A full inspection of the plumbing system is recommended.  
- **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC):** The HVAC system appears to be operational but is less energy-efficient compared to modern standards. Additional insulation may be required for better thermal performance.  
- **Fire Safety:** The fire extinguisher is functional, but the sprinkler system was not tested during the inspection. Fire safety regulations require annual testing of all fire protection systems.  
- **Accessibility:** The building has a single staircase with handrails on one side only, making it difficult to navigate for individuals with mobility challenges. Full compliance with accessibility standards requires modifications to the staircase and interior pathways.

---

### **7. Conclusion**  
The commercial building in Korsnäs has been assessed as structurally sound but requires several upgrades to meet current health, safety, and environmental standards. The inspection highlights the need for immediate action on fire safety and accessibility issues, while other systems may require long-term maintenance or replacement. Follow-up inspections are recommended within six months to assess the effectiveness of any proposed fixes.
