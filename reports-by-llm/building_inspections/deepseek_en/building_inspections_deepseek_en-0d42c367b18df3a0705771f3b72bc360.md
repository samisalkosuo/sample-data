### **3. Inspection Context**

On the morning of the inspection (29 April 2025), Pöytyä experienced partly cloudy weather with light precipitation. The temperature was mild, around -1°C, which posed minimal impact on the building's structural integrity but highlighted the need for thorough moisture checks.

The purpose of this inspection was to evaluate the current condition of the building and ensure compliance with local building regulations.

### **4. Observations and Findings**

#### **Structural Integrity**  
- The building exhibits signs of wear and tear consistent with its age (25 years). Minor cracks in the foundation were observed, likely due to settlement over time.  
- The structural framework appears sound, but there are no signs of major instability or damage requiring immediate intervention.  

#### **Electrical Systems**  
- The electrical panel is outdated and requires modernization. Several wiring connections show signs of corrosion, necessitating replacement or relocation.  

#### **Plumbing Systems**  
- The plumbing system shows signs of age-related deterioration. A few pipes near the foundation are cracked and require repair to prevent leaks.  

#### **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC)**  
- The HVAC units function adequately but operate inefficiently due to outdated refrigerants and expansion tanks. Upgrading these systems is recommended for energy efficiency.  

#### **Fire Safety**  
- The fire safety measures are adequate for the building's age. Fire extinguishers are functional, and all emergency exits have working signage and lighting.  

#### **Accessibility**  
- The building has minimal accessibility issues. A single-step staircase near the entrance could be made steeper to accommodate individuals with mobility challenges.
