### **4. Observations and Findings**  

#### **Structural Integrity**  
- The foundation appears intact, but there are signs of subsidence in the lower floors due to differential settling from the construction era (1975).  
- The wooden beams show minor warping, likely caused by moisture issues during the original construction.  

#### **Electrical Systems**  
- The electrical wiring is functional and meets current Finnish standards for safety. No major issues were observed in the circuit breakers or wiring connections.  

#### **Plumbing Systems**  
- The plumbing system appears to be operational, with no significant leaks detected during the inspection. However, the pipes are showing signs of wear and tear consistent with their age.  

#### **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC)**  
- The HVAC system is functional and provides adequate heating for Lapland's cold winters. No major issues were observed in the ductwork or insulation.  

#### **Fire Safety**  
- The fire safety measures are compliant with Finnish regulations as of 1975. However, the smoke detectors are outdated and require replacement to comply with modern standards.  

#### **Accessibility**  
- The building has basic accessibility features, but the stairs in the lower floors are uneven and require modification to meet current accessibility standards.
