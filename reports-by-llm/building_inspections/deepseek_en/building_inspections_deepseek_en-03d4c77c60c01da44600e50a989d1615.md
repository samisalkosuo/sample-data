### **4. Observations and Findings**  
- **Structural Integrity:**  
  - The foundation appears stable but shows signs of settling over time due to differential settlement, particularly in the south-facing columns.  
  - The beams in the second floor are slightly cracked along their length, likely from years of exposure to environmental factors.  

- **Electrical Systems:**  
  - The electrical wiring is outdated and requires modernization to meet current safety standards (e.g., updated circuit breakers and surge protection).  
  - The lighting fixtures are in good condition but lack energy-efficient LED replacements.  

- **Plumbing Systems:**  
  - The water pipes show signs of wear and tear, with a few joints needing repair to prevent leaks.  
  - The drainage system is functional but could benefit from a minor adjustment to improve water flow efficiency.  

- **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC):**  
  - The HVAC system operates efficiently but shows signs of inefficiency due to outdated refrigerants and insulation. Upgrading the system would enhance energy performance.  

- **Fire Safety:**  
  - The fire extinguisher is functional but does not comply with updated regulations regarding pressure ratings and storage requirements.  
  - Fire labels on the building materials are minimal, necessitating their replacement for compliance purposes.  

- **Accessibility:**  
  - The main entrance has a slight slope, which could pose accessibility challenges for individuals with mobility limitations.  
  - The staircase leading to the second floor is narrow and lacks handrails, posing safety risks for older residents or those with physical disabilities.
