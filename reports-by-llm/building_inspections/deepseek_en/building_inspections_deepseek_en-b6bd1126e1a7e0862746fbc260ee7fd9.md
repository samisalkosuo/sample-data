### **2. Building Overview**  
- **Building Type:** Public (Community Center)  
- **Construction Year:** 2011  
- **Number of Floors:** 5  
- **Primary Materials:** Reinforced concrete, brickwork, insulation panels (EPS), and aluminum cladding with UPVC windows.  

---

### **3. Inspection Context**  
The inspection was conducted on 30 December 2024 during the coldest part of the season in Finland. The weather conditions were freezing temperatures (-5°C) with light snowfall, which could impact structural stability, especially for older buildings. The purpose of this inspection was to evaluate the structural integrity and compliance with current building codes, with recommendations for potential renovations or resale considerations.

### **4. Observations and Findings**  

#### **Structural Integrity**  
- The building appears structurally sound, with no visible cracks in the foundation or mainframe components.  
- The reinforced concrete columns show minor wear but remain stable under current loads.  

#### **Electrical Systems**  
- The electrical panel is operational, but there are signs of outdated wiring in some areas (e.g., 10mm² copper cables in legacy junction boxes).  

#### **Plumbing Systems**  
- The plumbing system functions correctly, with no visible leaks or clogs. However, the water supply pipes show signs of pitting corrosion due to age and exposure to freezing temperatures.  

#### **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC)**  
- The HVAC system is operational and energy-efficient, but there are signs of inefficiency in some ductwork areas.  

#### **Fire Safety**  
- Fire extinguishers are present and functional, but the fire blankets in the common area are outdated and require replacement.  

#### **Accessibility**  
- The building has a sloped ramp with handrails for accessibility, but it is not compliant with Finnish accessibility standards (it lacks a level indicator).

### **5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**  

| **Issue**                          | **Details**                                                                 | **Recommendation**                                                                 |
|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------:|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| Outdated wiring system              | 10mm² copper cables in junction boxes; 2-inch conduit pipes in walls.       | Replace all outdated wiring and conduit pipes with larger-diameter materials.     |
| Pitting corrosion on plumbing pipes  | Visible pitting on water supply pipes; freezing temperatures have exacerbated the issue. | Replace the affected pipes or install a protective lining system.                |
| Outdated fire extinguisher          | Fire extinguishers are present but require servicing.                       | Service and maintain fire extinguishers as per regulations.                     |
| Non-compliant fire blankets         | Fire blankets in common areas are outdated; no storage lockers nearby.      | Install new fire blankets with appropriate storage lockers to meet Finnish standards. |
| Sloped ramp without level indicator  | Sloped ramp has handrails but lacks a level indicator.                       | Add a level indicator at the top of the ramp for better accessibility compliance. |

---

### **6. Compliance Summary**  
The building generally complies with current Finnish building codes and regulations, except for the following areas:  

- **Fire Safety:** The fire extinguishers are functional but require servicing to ensure they meet modern standards. The fire blankets in the common area are outdated and need replacement.  
- **Accessibility:** The sloped ramp is not fully compliant with accessibility standards due to the absence of a level indicator.  

Overall, the building meets 90% of compliance criteria, with minor issues that can be addressed without significant structural intervention.

---

### **7. Conclusion**  
The building inspection reveals that the structure remains in good condition and is safe for occupancy. However, there are areas where improvements or renovations could enhance its functionality and safety. If the building is used actively (e.g., as a community center), immediate attention to fire safety and accessibility issues is recommended.  

**Recommendation:** Conduct a full renovation or upgrade if the building is to be used in an active capacity.
