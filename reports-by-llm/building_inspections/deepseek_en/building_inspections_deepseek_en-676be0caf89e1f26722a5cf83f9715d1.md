### **4. Observations and Findings**

- **Structural Integrity:**  
  - The building appears structurally sound with no visible signs of immediate collapse or instability.
  - However, there are signs of wear and tear consistent with a building of its age (2007).

- **Electrical Systems:**  
  - The electrical wiring is outdated and requires modernization to meet current safety standards.  
  - There are flickering lights and potential issues with voltage fluctuations.

- **Plumbing Systems:**  
  - The plumbing system shows signs of wear, particularly in the pipes near the foundation.
  - There are occasional leaks at the base of the building, likely due to insufficient sealing during construction.

- **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC):**  
  - The HVAC system is functional but inefficient.  
  - There are signs of poor insulation around the heating pipes, leading to higher energy consumption.

- **Fire Safety:**  
  - The fire extinguisher is functional but not compliant with current regulations.
  - The sprinkler system appears to be in good condition and recently tested.

- **Accessibility:**  
  - The building has a single staircase, which may pose challenges for individuals with mobility issues.  
  - There are no handrails on the outer walls, posing a safety hazard.
