### **5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

| **Issue**                                                                 | **Recommendation**                                                                 |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Outdated insulation in the attic and walls due to age.                   | Upgrade the insulation to improve energy efficiency and reduce heat loss.           |
| Pitted pipes in the basement requiring attention.                        | Replace or repair the pitted pipes to prevent future leaks and extend lifespan.    |
| Dust and grime accumulation on HVAC ductwork.                           | Clean the ductwork regularly to maintain air quality and system efficiency.        |
| Operational but inefficient HVAC system.                                 | Consider upgrading to a more energy-efficient HVAC system for better comfort.     |
