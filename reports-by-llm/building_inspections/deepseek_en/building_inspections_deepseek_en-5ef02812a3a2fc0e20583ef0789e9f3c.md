### **3. Inspection Context**

On the morning of the inspection, Vaasa experienced partly cloudy weather with a slight chance of rain at around 10°C (50°F). The temperature was moderate for autumn in Finland, with wind speeds around 12 km/h (7 mph). The purpose of this inspection was to conduct a routine structural check on the industrial facility to ensure compliance with current building codes and safety standards.

### **4. Observations and Findings**

#### **Structural Integrity**  
- The building appears structurally sound, with no visible signs of foundation settlement or major frame distortions. However, the concrete beams in the second floor exhibit minor stress cracks that were not immediately noticeable during the inspection.

#### **Electrical System**  
- The electrical panel is operational but outdated. Several live wires are marked as "outdated" on the blueprints, and there are signs of moisture damage to the wiring insulation in several receptacles.

#### **Plumbing System**  
- The plumbing system functions adequately for basic needs (water supply, drainage, and waste disposal). However, there is a visible water leak at the base of one of the external pipes near the foundation. No significant issues were observed in the water supply or drainage systems.

#### **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC)**  
- The HVAC system operates efficiently but shows signs of wear and tear. The condenser coil requires cleaning, and there is a minor crack in one of the evaporator fins. The ductwork appears clean but lacks proper insulation around the return ducts.

#### **Fire Safety**  
- The fire extinguisher on the second floor is functional and properly maintained. However, the automatic sprinkler system was not triggered during the inspection due to the absence of a water supply in the test area. Fire safety labels are present on all external surfaces but could be more visible for emergency response.

#### **Accessibility**  
- The building has two fire exits, one exterior and one interior, which function correctly. However, the width of one of the exterior doors is slightly narrower than the recommended minimum (102 cm), posing a minor safety hazard. The lighting in the basement area could be improved for better visibility during inspections.

### **5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

| **Issue**                                      | **Recommendation**                                                                 |
|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Outdated electrical wiring                       | Replace or update the wiring system with modern, energy-efficient components.        |
| Water leak at external pipe near foundation       | Seal the pipe using a suitable adhesive or consult a plumber for repair.             |
| Minor crack in evaporator fin                      | Clean and reinforce the condenser coil as needed.                                  |
| Fire safety labels need improvement              | Make the labels more visible (e.g., larger font, brighter colors).                  |
| Narrow exterior door                              | Increase the width of the affected door to meet safety standards.                 |
| Insufficient lighting in basement area            | Upgrade the lighting fixtures for better visibility and safety.                   |

### **6. Compliance Summary**

The building complies with the local fire safety regulations but does not fully comply with the updated national building codes, particularly regarding the electrical system and structural integrity of the foundation beams. The current maintenance practices are adequate for a 1976-built structure, but updates are recommended to ensure long-term functionality and safety.

---

### **7. Conclusion**

The industrial facility in Vaasa is structurally stable and functional but requires minor updates to its electrical wiring, fire safety labels, and accessibility features. No major safety concerns were identified during the inspection. The building should be inspected again within six months for any potential deterioration or new issues arising from environmental conditions.
