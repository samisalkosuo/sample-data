### **3. Inspection Context**  
The inspection was conducted on 03.05.2025 in Karvia, Lapland, under cold and snowy weather conditions typical for this time of year. The temperature was recorded at -12Â°C, and there was a significant accumulation of snow on the building's roof and surrounding areas. The purpose of the inspection was to ensure compliance with current Finnish building codes while evaluating the structural integrity and functionality of the property.

### **4. Observations and Findings**  

#### **Structural Integrity**  
- The building appears structurally sound, with no visible signs of foundation settlement or major frame damage. However, the roof trusses show signs of wear consistent with their age (25 years since construction).  

#### **Electrical Systems**  
- The electrical wiring is outdated and requires modernization to meet current Finnish safety standards. There are no immediate fire hazards, but upgrading the circuit breakers and installing gfcb (gas-filled circuit breakers) is recommended.  

#### **Plumbing Systems**  
- The plumbing system appears functional, with no visible leaks or clogs. However, the pipes in the basement are outdated and require replacement to improve efficiency and reduce water loss.  

#### **Heating and Cooling Systems**  
- The HVAC system is operational but shows signs of inefficiency due to outdated ductwork and lack of regular maintenance. Upgrading the system to a more energy-efficient model is recommended.  

#### **Fire Safety**  
- The fire extinguishers are functional, but the sprinkler system does not meet current Finnish regulations. Upgrading the sprinkler heads to high-pressure, high-flow units is necessary for compliance.  

#### **Accessibility**  
- The property has limited accessibility due to steep exterior stairs and a narrow door frame in the main entrance. These modifications were made during construction (1994) but may impede future access for individuals with mobility challenges.

### **5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**  

| **Issue**                          | **Recommendation**                                                                 |
|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Outdated electrical wiring           | Upgrade to modern circuit breakers (gfcb) and install gas-filled circuit breakers. |
| Outdated plumbing fixtures          | Replace old pipes in the basement with modern, efficient fixtures.                |
| Inefficient HVAC system              | Upgrade the HVAC system to a more energy-efficient model.                        |
| Non-compliant sprinkler system       | Upgrade the sprinkler heads to high-pressure, high-flow units.                   |
| Limited accessibility               | Revise the exterior stairs and door frame for wider access (e.g., ramps or widened doorways). |

### **6. Compliance Summary**  
The building does not fully comply with current Finnish building codes due to outdated systems and materials. However, it is structurally sound and could be brought into full compliance with modern regulations through the recommended upgrades.

---

### **7. Conclusion**  
The commercial building in question has been maintained adequately over the past 30 years but requires updates to its electrical, plumbing, HVAC, and fire safety systems. The structural integrity remains intact, but upgrading these components will ensure long-term functionality and compliance with modern building standards. If major renovations are planned, consulting a professional architect or engineer is advisable.
