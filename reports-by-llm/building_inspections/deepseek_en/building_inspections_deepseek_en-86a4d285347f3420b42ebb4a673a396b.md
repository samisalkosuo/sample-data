### **3. Inspection Context**  
The inspection was conducted on 02.01.2025, during a cold winter day in Hailuoto. The temperature was -5Â°C, and there was a light layer of snow on the ground. The purpose of this inspection was to conduct a routine structural check of the commercial building to ensure compliance with local building codes and to assess its readiness for potential resale or renovation.

### **4. Observations and Findings**  

#### **Structural Integrity**  
- The wooden beams supporting the second floor exhibited signs of wear and tear, particularly along the north-facing side where snow accumulation had caused compression stress.  
- The metal framework was in good condition but showed signs of rust on several bolts and rivets, likely from exposure to the elements over the past two decades.

#### **Electrical System**  
- The electrical wiring was outdated and required modernization. Specifically:  
  - Two of the ceiling lights were non-functional due to aged fixtures.  
  - The main power panel lacked proper circuit breakers for several appliances, posing a safety hazard if an overload occurs.  

#### **Plumbing System**  
- The plumbing system appeared functional but showed signs of wear and tear. Specifically:  
  - A few water pipes in the basement exhibited discoloration due to age-related corrosion.  
  - The toilet had a weak flushing mechanism that could be improved for efficiency and reliability.  

#### **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC)**  
- The HVAC system was operational but inefficient. Specifically:  
  - The ductwork in the ceiling had gaps where air could seep through during colder months.  
  - The heat pump required additional insulation to improve energy efficiency.  

#### **Fire Safety**  
- The smoke detectors were functional and correctly tested, but the emergency exit signs lacked visibility due to dirt accumulation on the glass.  
- The fire extinguishers were in good condition and ready for use.

#### **Accessibility**  
- The building had basic accessibility features:  
  - A single staircase with handrails was available for exiting.  
  - The front entrance door was functional but lacked a tactile threshold indicator, which could be an issue for individuals with sensory impairments.

### **5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**  

#### **Structural Integrity**  
- **Issue:** Wooden beams show wear and compression stress on the north side due to snow accumulation.  
  - **Recommendation:** Replace the affected beams or reinforce them with additional steel plates to prevent further structural damage.  

#### **Electrical System**  
- **Issue:** Outdated wiring, non-functional ceiling lights, and insufficient circuit breakers.  
  - **Recommendation:** Upgrade the electrical system to modern standards, including replacing all fixtures, installing proper circuit breakers, and upgrading the main panel.  

#### **Plumbing System**  
- **Issue:** Discoloration of pipes in the basement due to corrosion and weak toilet flushing mechanism.  
  - **Recommendation:** Replace the affected pipes with high-quality stainless steel equivalents and upgrade the toilet to a more efficient model.  

#### **HVAC System**  
- **Issue:** Inefficient HVAC system with gaps in ductwork and poor insulation.  
  - **Recommendation:** Insulate the ductwork and add additional insulation around the heat pump for improved energy efficiency.  

#### **Fire Safety**  
- **Issue:** Outdated emergency exit signs lacking visibility due to dirt accumulation.  
  - **Recommendation:** Clean or replace all emergency exit signs to ensure they are visible and functional.  

#### **Accessibility**  
- **Issue:** Lack of a tactile threshold indicator on the front door.  
  - **Recommendation:** Install a tactile threshold indicator for better accessibility for individuals with sensory impairments.

### **6. Compliance Summary**  
Based on the inspection, the building partially complies with current Finnish building codes and standards. Key areas requiring improvement include:  
- Structural integrity of beams and foundation.  
- Upgrading electrical wiring to modern standards.  
- Enhancing plumbing efficiency and safety features.  
- Improving HVAC system performance and insulation.  

---

### **7. Conclusion**  
The commercial building in Hailuoto, constructed in 2002, is structurally sound but shows signs of age-related wear and tear. While it meets basic compliance standards for fire safety and accessibility, significant upgrades are needed to ensure long-term functionality and efficiency. The recommended actions will address these issues and bring the building closer to modern building codes and standards.
