### **4. Observations and Findings**  

#### **Structural Integrity**  
- The building appears structurally sound, with no visible signs of major subsidence or bowing of beams. However, there are minor cracks in the foundation walls that were repaired during construction but have not been fully addressed.  

#### **Electrical System**  
- The electrical wiring is outdated and does not comply with current Finnish electrical regulations. There are several loose connections and overloaded circuits that could pose safety risks if left unaddressed.  

#### **Plumbing System**  
- The plumbing system appears functional, but there are signs of mildew growth in the basement due to inadequate ventilation during construction. This could lead to health issues over time.  

#### **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC)**  
- The HVAC system is operational and provides comfortable temperatures inside the home. However, it is less energy-efficient compared to modern standards, which could contribute to higher utility bills in the future.  

#### **Fire Safety**  
- The building has standard smoke detectors installed, but they are not tested regularly according to Finnish fire safety regulations. Additionally, there is no sprinkler system in place, which could be a critical omission given the construction year and local climate.  

#### **Accessibility**  
- The property has a sloped driveway that requires additional landscaping or modifications to meet accessibility standards for future buyers or tenants with mobility challenges.

|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Minor cracks in foundation walls                                           | Repairs were performed during construction but require full reinforcement.   | Repair the affected areas using modern materials to prevent further cracking.     |
| Outdated electrical wiring                                                   | Several loose connections and overloaded circuits.                         | Replace outdated wiring with updated circuit breakers and proper insulation.      |
| Mildew growth in basement                                                  | Inadequate ventilation during construction.                                   | Improve basement ventilation and install a dehumidifier for better moisture control.|
| Outdated smoke detectors                                                   | Not tested regularly, and no sprinkler system is present.                   | Replace smoke detectors with modern ones and install a sprinkler system.          |
| Sloped driveway                                                            | Requires modification to meet accessibility standards.                      | Level the driveway or add landscaping features to improve ease of access.        |

### **6. Compliance Summary**  
The building generally complies with Finnish building regulations, but there are areas where improvements can be made to enhance safety and efficiency. The HVAC system is operational but could be upgraded for better energy performance. Additionally, fire safety measures need to be modernized, and accessibility features should be addressed to meet future standards.

### **7. Conclusion**  
The residential building in question has a good overall condition, with minor issues that can be resolved without significant structural changes. The recommendations aim to ensure long-term compliance with local regulations and improve the building's functionality and safety. Follow-up inspections are recommended within six months to verify the effectiveness of the proposed fixes.
