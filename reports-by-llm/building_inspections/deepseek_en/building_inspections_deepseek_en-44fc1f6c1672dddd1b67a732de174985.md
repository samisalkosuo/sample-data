### **4. Observations and Findings**  

#### **Structural Integrity**  
- The building appears structurally sound, with no visible signs of sagging or excessive deformation in its frame or walls. However, there are minor cracks in some of the brickwork that do not compromise stability.  

#### **Electrical Systems**  
- The electrical panel is outdated and requires modernization to meet current Finnish electrical codes. There are no live wires exposed, but the wiring system does not comply with updated safety standards for voltage levels and insulation requirements.  

#### **Plumbing Systems**  
- The plumbing system appears functional, with no visible leaks or clogs in the pipes. However, the water heater is outdated and requires replacement to meet modern efficiency and safety standards.  

#### **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC)**  
- The HVAC system is operational but shows signs of wear and tear. The ductwork has minor tears that could potentially compromise air quality during extreme cold or hot conditions.  

#### **Fire Safety**  
- The fire extinguisher is functional and in good condition. However, the sprinkler system does not meet current Finnish fire safety regulations due to outdated design features and insufficient coverage in certain areas.  

#### **Accessibility**  
- The building has basic accessibility features, including a ramp at the entrance and grab bars in the bathrooms. However, there are no elevators installed, which could pose challenges for individuals with mobility impairments.

### **6. Compliance Summary**  
The commercial building in question is mostly compliant with Finnish building codes and standards, but it has several areas that require attention to bring it up to modern regulatory requirements. The primary non-compliance relates to the electrical wiring system, HVAC system, and sprinkler system.  

---

### **7. Conclusion**  
The commercial building appears to be structurally sound and functional for its intended use, with minor issues that do not currently affect its operational capacity. To ensure long-term compliance with Finnish building regulations and safety standards, the following actions are recommended: replacing outdated electrical wiring, modernizing the HVAC system, upgrading the water heater, repairing minor structural issues, and installing elevators to improve accessibility.
