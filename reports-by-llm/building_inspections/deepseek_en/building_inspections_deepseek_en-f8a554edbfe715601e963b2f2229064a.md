### **3. Inspection Context**  
The inspection was conducted on 21 March 2025 during a mild winter day in Eura, Finland. The temperature was approximately -4°C, with light sleet expected at the time of the inspection. The building was inspected as part of a routine check for commercial use, with the primary purpose being to evaluate its structural integrity and compliance with current building codes.

### **4. Observations and Findings**  

#### **Structural Integrity**  
- The building appears structurally sound overall, with no immediate signs of bowing or leaning in the walls or floors. However, there are visible signs of moisture damage on the wooden beams spanning the second floor, likely due to condensation from adjacent green spaces.

#### **Electrical Systems**  
- The electrical panel is operational but shows signs of wear and tear. Two of the five circuits require upgrading for safety compliance with current Finnish standards. The lighting fixtures are functional but outdated, requiring modernization.

#### **Plumbing Systems**  
- The plumbing system functions adequately, though there are clogs in two of the four pipes. These appear to be caused by debris settling over time and will require cleaning or replacement.

#### **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC)**  
- The HVAC system operates efficiently but shows signs of inefficiency due to outdated ductwork and lack of insulation around the air handlers. Upgrading this system is recommended for energy efficiency.

#### **Fire Safety**  
- The fire extinguishers are functional and properly maintained. However, the sprinkler system is non-functional, indicating a potential failure in the installation or maintenance during construction.

#### **Accessibility**  
- The building has basic accessibility features, including an elevator and wide doorways. However, the stairs leading to the second floor are narrow and require additional handrails for compliance with Finnish accessibility standards.

### **5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**  

| **Issue**                                      | **Recommendation**                                                                 |
|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Moisture damage on wooden beams (second floor).  | Seal cracks in wooden beams to prevent further moisture damage.                    |
| Outdated electrical wiring requiring upgrade.    | Replace outdated wiring with modern, energy-efficient systems.                   |
| Clogs in two plumbing pipes.                   | Clean or replace the clogged pipes as needed.                                    |
| Inefficient HVAC system due to outdated ductwork.| Upgrade HVAC system for improved energy efficiency and performance.             |
| Non-functional sprinkler system.                | Investigate causes of non-operation and repair or upgrade the system.            |
| Narrow stairs requiring handrails.              | Install additional handrails on the stairs to meet accessibility standards.        |

### **6. Compliance Summary**  
The building does not fully comply with current Finnish building codes due to outdated systems, inefficient insulation, and potential structural issues from moisture damage. However, all identified issues are actionable and can be resolved without significant disruption to normal operations.

---

### **7. Conclusion**  
The Valmari Business Park is in good overall condition for a commercial property of its age. Minor to moderate maintenance will ensure long-term functionality and compliance with building regulations. Further action on the non-functional sprinkler system and outdated electrical wiring is recommended to prevent future issues.
