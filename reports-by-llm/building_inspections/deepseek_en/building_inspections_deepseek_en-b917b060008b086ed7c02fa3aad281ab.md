### **3. Inspection Context**  
The inspection was conducted on 27 May 2025 during a sunny day in Rantasalmi, Lapland, where temperatures reached approximately 15°C. The inspection was carried out as part of a routine building check to ensure compliance with local building regulations and to assess the structural integrity of the property for potential resale or further use.

### **4. Observations and Findings**  

#### **Structural Integrity**  
- The wooden clapboard exterior shows signs of wear and tear, particularly on the south-facing side due to exposure to northern light during construction years 2009–2015.  
- The cavity wall insulation was installed in 2012 but appears to be slightly degraded, requiring attention within the next 3–5 years.  

#### **Electrical System**  
- The electrical wiring is over 15 years old and requires modernization to meet current Finnish building codes. Upgrading is recommended to ensure safety and efficiency.  

#### **Plumbing System**  
- The plumbing system was installed in 2014 but shows signs of mildew growth on the pipes due to inadequate drainage during construction. Immediate action is required to replace or repair the affected sections.  

#### **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC)**  
- The HVAC system was installed in 2016 and operates efficiently but does not meet modern energy efficiency standards. Upgrading to a high-efficiency system is recommended within the next 5 years.  

#### **Fire Safety**  
- The smoke detectors were installed in 2014 and are functional but outdated. They do not comply with current Finnish fire safety regulations, which require more advanced detector types.  

#### **Accessibility**  
- The property features a sloped staircase that does not meet the accessibility standards set by the Finnish Building Act. Upstairs access is required to fully comply with local regulations.
