### **3. Inspection Context**  
The inspection was conducted on 12 April 2025 during a mild spring day in Lapland, where temperatures fluctuated between -5°C and +5°C throughout the day. The weather conditions were partly cloudy with light snowfall towards the end of the inspection period. The purpose of this inspection was to conduct a routine structural evaluation of the building to ensure compliance with current Finnish building codes and recommendations for public buildings of similar age and type.

### **4. Observations and Findings**  
- **Structural Integrity:** The building appears structurally sound, with no visible signs of major foundation or framing issues. However, outdated insulation in the walls and roof suggests potential energy efficiency improvements.  
- **Electrical System:** The electrical wiring is operational but shows signs of wear and tear, particularly in the distribution panel.  
- **Plumbing System:** The plumbing system functions adequately for its intended use (e.g., water supply, sanitation). No major leaks or clogs were observed during the inspection.  
- **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC):** The HVAC system is functional but operates inefficiently due to outdated equipment. Additional energy-efficient units could be installed in the future.  
- **Fire Safety:** The fire safety measures are adequate for a public building of this age. Fire extinguishers are present and functional, and all emergency exits have working signage.  
- **Accessibility:** The building is accessible but lacks sufficient handrails on stairs and does not meet modern accessibility standards for public spaces (e.g., ramps or widened doorways).

### **5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**  
1. **Structural Concerns:**  
   - Outdated insulation in walls and roof: Replace with energy-efficient materials to improve thermal performance.  
2. **Electrical System:**  
   - Replacement of outdated distribution panel components to ensure long-term reliability.  
3. **Plumbing System:**  
   - Upgrade to modern water softening equipment to reduce maintenance costs and improve water quality.  
4. **HVAC System:**  
   - Modernize HVAC units to enhance energy efficiency and reduce operational costs.  
5. **Fire Safety:**  
   - Ensure all fire extinguishers are within specification and properly maintained.  
6. **Accessibility:**  
   - Install handrails on stairs and widen doorways to meet modern accessibility standards.

### **6. Compliance Summary**  
The building complies with current Finnish building regulations for public buildings of its type and construction era, but several areas require improvement to align with updated codes and standards. Upgrading outdated systems is recommended to ensure long-term functionality and safety.  

---

### **7. Conclusion**  
The building in question appears to be well-maintained and structurally sound, though it shows signs of wear consistent with its age. While no major safety issues were identified during the inspection, several recommendations have been made to enhance its energy efficiency, accessibility, and compliance with modern building standards.
