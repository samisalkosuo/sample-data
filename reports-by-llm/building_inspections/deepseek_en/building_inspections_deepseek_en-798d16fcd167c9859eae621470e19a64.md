The inspection was conducted on 25 February 2025, during a partly cloudy day in Finland's winter climate. The temperature was below freezing, with light snowfall expected at the time of the inspection.

---

### **4. Observations and Findings**  

#### **Structural Integrity**  
- The building appears structurally sound, with no visible signs of major damage or instability. However, there are minor signs of wear on the steel beams, consistent with their age (27 years).  

#### **Electrical Systems**  
- The electrical panel is outdated and requires modernization to comply with current Finnish electrical codes. There are no immediate safety concerns but could pose risks in future upgrades.  

#### **Plumbing Systems**  
- The plumbing system shows signs of mildew growth on the pipes, likely due to inadequate ventilation or poor insulation. Immediate remedial action is recommended to prevent further deterioration.  

#### **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC)**  
- The HVAC system operates efficiently but lacks energy-efficient controls. Upgrading to modern smart controls could improve energy efficiency in the future.  

#### **Fire Safety**  
- Fire extinguishers are present but not integrated into a fire suppression system. Additional smoke detectors should be installed throughout the building for compliance with Finnish fire safety regulations.  

#### **Accessibility**  
- The building has basic accessibility features, including ramps and wide doorways. However, there is no elevator access to upper floors, which could pose challenges for individuals with mobility issues.

### **5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**  

| **Issue**                          | **Details**                                                                 | **Recommendation**                                                                 |
|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------:|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| Outdated electrical wiring            | Needs modernization to comply with current Finnish electrical codes.       | Upgrade the electrical panel and controls.                                         |
| Leaking pipes                         | Mildew growth on pipes suggests inadequate ventilation or insulation.      | Install fans or improve insulation in affected areas.                             |
| Inefficient HVAC system              | Lack of energy-efficient controls.                                           | Upgrade to smart, energy-efficient controls.                                       |
| Fire safety measures                 | No integrated fire suppression system; smoke detectors are present but not part of a system. | Integrate smoke detectors into a fire suppression system and install additional detectors. |
| Basic accessibility features       | Ramps and wide doorways exist but no elevator access to upper floors.      | Install an elevator for access to all floors.                                      |
