### **2. Building Overview**

- **Building Type:** Public (Commercial Office Space)  
- **Construction Year:** 2013  
- **Number of Floors:** 5  
- **Primary Materials:** Prefabricated metal panels, concrete, and insulation panels (EPS foam).  

The building is a modern commercial office space located in the heart of Oulainen. It consists of five floors with a total area of approximately 2,000 m². The construction utilized prefabricated metal panels for exterior walls, which are durable and energy-efficient, along with concrete slabs for the foundation and EPS insulation for thermal efficiency.

### **3. Inspection Context**

The inspection was conducted on 14 October 2024 during mild autumn weather in Oulainen. The temperature was around 15°C, with light rain expected later that day. The inspection was part of a routine structural check to ensure compliance with local building regulations and to assess the building's readiness for potential resale or further use.

### **4. Observations and Findings**

- **Structural Integrity:**  
  - The building appears structurally sound, with no signs of major foundation issues or lateral load failures. However, there are minor signs of subsidence in the lower floors due to differential settling from the construction of a nearby infrastructure project.

- **Electrical System:**  
  - The electrical panel is outdated and requires modernization (e.g., upgrading to smart meters and renewable energy integration). No live electrical faults were detected during the inspection.

- **Plumbing System:**  
  - The plumbing system appears functional, with no visible leaks or clogs. However, there are signs of mildew growth on internal walls due to poor ventilation in certain areas.

- **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC):**  
  - The HVAC system is operational but shows signs of inefficiency. The ductwork has minor cracks that may impact energy performance. A full overhaul of the HVAC system is recommended for improved thermal comfort and energy savings.

- **Fire Safety:**  
  - Fire extinguishers are present in all public areas, but they are outdated and require replacement. Fire blankets are also available upon request but not installed yet.

- **Accessibility:**  
  - The building has a sloped roof, which makes certain areas inaccessible for wheelchairs or manual wheelchairs. A ramp to the entrance is missing and needs to be constructed at an additional cost.

### **5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

| **Issue**                          | **Details**                                                                 | **Recommendation**                                                                 |
|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------:|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| Outdated electrical panel           | The panel was installed in 2010 and needs modernization.                   | Replace with a smart meter system by the end of 2025.                              |
| Minor subsidence in lower floors     | Caused by differential settling from adjacent construction.               | Consult a geotechnical engineer to stabilize the foundation.                      |
| Mildew growth on internal walls      | Due to poor ventilation in certain areas.                                  | Improve ventilation systems or install fans in affected zones.                    |
| Inefficient HVAC system             | Ductwork shows signs of wear and tear.                                      | Overhaul the HVAC system, including replacing faulty ducts, by 2026.            |
| Outdated fire extinguishers         | Need replacement to comply with current regulations.                        | Replace all fire extinguishers in public areas within 12 months.                 |
| Missing fire blankets                | Available upon request but not yet installed.                              | Install fire blankets in high-risk areas immediately.                             |
| Sloped roof accessibility issue      | Prevents use of certain areas by wheelchairs or manual wheelchairs.        | Construct a ramp to the entrance within 6 months.                                 |

### **6. Compliance Summary**

The building generally complies with local and national building regulations, but several minor issues fall outside current compliance standards. The primary non-compliance relates to outdated fire safety equipment and the need for modernization of the electrical panel. These issues are addressable without significant structural changes.

---

### **7. Conclusion**

The inspected commercial office space in Oulainen is structurally sound and functional, with only minor areas requiring attention. Immediate actions include replacing outdated fire extinguishers and upgrading the electrical panel. The HVAC system should be overhauled within 2026 to improve energy efficiency. A ramp for accessibility will need to be constructed at an additional cost.
