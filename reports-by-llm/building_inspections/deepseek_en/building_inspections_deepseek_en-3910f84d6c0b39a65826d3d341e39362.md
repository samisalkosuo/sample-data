### **1. General Information**
- **Country**: Finland  
- **Municipality**: Inkoo  
- **Address**: [Invent one address, e.g., "商业中心 5, 芯谷大道 23, 城市inkoo, Finland"]  
- **Inspection Date**: 07.11.2024 (DD.MM.YYYY)  
- **Inspector Name**: Eeva Kivimaa

### **2. Building Overview**
- **Building Type**: Commercial (e.g., office or retail space)  
- **Construction Year**: 2018  
- **Number of Floors**: 7  
- **Primary Materials**: Steel frame with cladding panels (aluminum and glass). The building is constructed in a typical commercial structure, featuring a reinforced concrete basement for structural stability.  

---

### **3. Inspection Context**
On the morning of the inspection, the weather conditions were partly cloudy with light mist. The temperature was around 12°C, and there was a slight breeze affecting the thermal insulation slightly. The inspector conducted the examination as part of a routine building check to ensure compliance with local regulations before potential resale or leasing.

### **4. Observations and Findings**
#### **Structural Integrity**  
- The steel frame appears structurally sound but shows signs of wear and tear consistent with its age (2018). Minor cracks in the beams were observed, which are likely due to environmental factors rather than neglect.  

#### **Electrical Systems**  
- The electrical panel is outdated, with several receptacles showing yellowing signs of corrosion. The circuit breakers are not labeled with the correct amperage ratings based on current building codes ( Helsinki City Ordinance for Commercial Buildings).  

#### **Plumbing Systems**  
- The plumbing system appears functional but has visible water stains on the ceiling tiles in the main office area. These stains may indicate minor water leaks, possibly from inefficient drainage systems or condensation issues.  

#### **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC)**  
- The HVAC units are in good working condition but show signs of moderate dirt accumulation around the outdoor units. This could affect their efficiency over time.  

#### **Fire Safety**  
- The smoke detectors installed in 2019 are functional but lack a dedicated fire alarm system. Fire extinguishers are present and functional, though they require regular maintenance to ensure optimal performance.  

#### **Accessibility**  
- The building has poorly lit emergency exits, making them difficult for individuals with limited mobility to navigate during evacuation drills. The main staircase also shows wear on the handrails, which could pose a safety hazard.

### **5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**
1. **Electrical Systems**: Update the electrical panel with modern circuit breakers compliant with current Helsinki City Ordinance standards (e.g., 2023 updated ratings).  
2. **Plumbing Systems**: Replace outdated water pipes to prevent further water leaks or mold growth.  
3. **HVAC Units**: Clean the dirt buildup on outdoor units and consider upgrading to energy-efficient models if feasible.  
4. **Fire Safety**: Install a dedicated fire alarm system with corresponding smoke detectors in all areas. Ensure all fire extinguishers are regularly maintained.  
5. **Accessibility**: Improve lighting in emergency exits and replace worn-out handrails for enhanced safety.  

---

### **6. Compliance Summary**
The building partially complies with current Finnish building regulations but does not fully meet modern standards due to outdated systems and materials. Recommendations have been made to address these gaps, ensuring the structure remains safe and functional over the long term.

---

### **7. Conclusion**
The commercial building in Inkoo, Finland, is structurally sound but requires updates to its electrical, plumbing, HVAC, fire safety, and accessibility systems to align with modern standards. Routine maintenance and upgrades are recommended to ensure compliance with local regulations and enhance overall safety and functionality.
