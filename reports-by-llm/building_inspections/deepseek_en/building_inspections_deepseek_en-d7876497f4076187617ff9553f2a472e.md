### **3. Inspection Context**  
The inspection was conducted on 21 July 2025 during the warm summer months in Lapland. The temperature was approximately 28°C (82°F), with moderate humidity due to local weather patterns. The purpose of this inspection was to conduct a routine structural evaluation of the building, focusing on its ability to withstand current environmental conditions and ensure compliance with updated building codes.

### **4. Observations and Findings**  

#### **Structural Integrity**  
- The building appears structurally sound overall, with no immediate signs of collapse or instability. However, there are visible cracks in the foundation walls, likely due to the weight of snow over the past winter. These cracks do not compromise the integrity of the structure but require attention to prevent further deterioration.

#### **Electrical Systems**  
- The electrical panel and wiring were inspected, and while functional, they appear outdated. Several components, such as circuit breakers and switches, are nearing their end of life and require replacement or modernization to meet current safety standards.

#### **Water and sewer systems**  
- The water pipes show signs of rust and corrosion in several areas, particularly along the foundation. This is likely due to the building's age and lack of regular maintenance. No significant leaks were observed during the inspection.

#### **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC)**  
- The HVAC system appears functional but is operating inefficiently. There are signs of wear and tear on the ductwork, and the refrigerant levels are low. Upgrading this system to a more energy-efficient model is recommended to reduce operational costs.

#### **Fire Safety**  
- The fire extinguishers are functional and in good condition. However, the building's fire safety systems do not meet the updated national standards. Specifically, the sprinkler system was installed in the 1990s and requires modernization to comply with current regulations.

#### **Accessibility**  
- The ramps leading to the building are in good condition but show signs of wear. Stairs within the building require minor repairs to ensure they meet accessibility standards for future use.

### **5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**  

| **Issue**                                                                 | **Recommendation**                                                                 |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Visible cracks in foundation walls                                         | Repair or stabilization of affected areas using modern materials and techniques.  |
| Outdated electrical wiring and components                                     | Replace or upgrade the electrical systems to meet current safety standards.        |
| Signs of rust and corrosion in water pipes                                    | Replace or repair the affected pipe sections to prevent further deterioration.       |
| Inefficient HVAC system and ductwork                                         | Upgrade the HVAC system for better energy efficiency and performance.             |
| Fire safety systems not meeting updated national standards                    | Modernize the fire extinguisher system and upgrade the sprinkler installation.    |
| Ramps requiring minor repairs                                                  | Repair or replace ramps to ensure accessibility compliance.                       |

### **6. Compliance Summary**  
The building is in good overall condition but does not fully comply with the current national building regulations. The primary non-compliance relates to outdated electrical and HVAC systems, as well as the fire safety infrastructure. Modernizing these components will ensure long-term compliance and operational efficiency.

---

### **7. Conclusion**  
The building inspection report indicates that Janakkala's public building is structurally sound but requires attention to modernize its electrical, HVAC, and fire safety systems. The overall condition of the building is satisfactory for current use but necessitates routine maintenance and upgrades to ensure compliance with updated standards.

**Recommendation:** Conduct a follow-up inspection within 12 months to monitor any progress made on the recommended upgrades. If no significant changes are implemented, schedule an additional inspection in 3-5 years to assess long-term compliance.
