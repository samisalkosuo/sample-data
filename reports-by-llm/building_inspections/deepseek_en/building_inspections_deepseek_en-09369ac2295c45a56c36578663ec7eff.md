### **4. Observations and Findings**

#### **Structural Integrity**  
- The building appears structurally sound, with no visible signs of major displacement or cracking in the exterior walls. However, there are minor signs of settlement at the foundation level on the south side, likely due to differential expansion from seasonal temperature changes.

#### **Electrical System**  
- The electrical panel is operational and maintains proper voltage levels (220V). All lighting fixtures function correctly, but several ceiling lights were identified as non-functional. These are deemed to be outdated components that require replacement.

#### **Plumbing System**  
- The plumbing system appears functional, with all water supply lines functioning properly. However, the greywater drainage from the laboratory area is slow due to an obstructed sump pump. A partial blockage in a drain pipe near the foundation has been identified as contributing factors.

#### **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC)**  
- The HVAC system operates efficiently, maintaining comfortable temperatures inside the facility. No signs of leaks or malfunctions were observed during the inspection.

#### **Fire Safety**  
- The fire extinguisher is functional and in good working condition. Fire doors are intact but show minor signs of wear on the hinges. All emergency exits (two staircases and two external doors) are clear and accessible to staff.

#### **Accessibility**  
- The facility has a single staircase leading to the second floor, which is narrow and uneven at several points. This could pose challenges for individuals with mobility issues or wheelchairs. A ramp near the entrance would improve accessibility.
