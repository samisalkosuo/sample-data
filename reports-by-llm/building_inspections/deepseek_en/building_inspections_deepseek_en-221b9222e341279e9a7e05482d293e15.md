### **4. Observations and Findings**  

#### **Structural Integrity**  
- The building appears structurally sound, with no visible signs of foundation settlement or major frame damage. However, there are signs of subsidence in the outer walls, likely due to differential settling over the years.  

#### **Electrical System**  
- The electrical wiring is outdated and requires modernization. There are several receptacles without proper circuit breakers, and the lighting system is inefficient, leading to higher energy consumption.  

#### **Plumbing System**  
- The plumbing system shows signs of wear and tear. The water supply pipes are in good condition, but there are multiple leaks in the drainage system, particularly around the foundation.  

#### **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC)**  
- The HVAC system is functional but inefficient. There are frequent drafts through the windows, indicating poor insulation. The heating system requires annual maintenance to maintain optimal performance.  

#### **Fire Safety**  
- The fire extinguisher installed in 2013 is still functional but does not comply with current Finnish fire safety regulations. Updates to the fire suppression system are recommended.  

#### **Accessibility**  
- The building has basic accessibility features, including a ramp and elevator access for轮椅 users. However, there are no elevators or ramps available for individuals with limited mobility, posing a risk for older residents.
