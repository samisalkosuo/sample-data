### **3. Inspection Context**

The inspection was conducted on 04 February 2025 during the early morning hours due to freezing temperatures and light snowfall in Virolahti. The weather conditions were cold, with a temperature of -1°C at the time of the inspection. The purpose of this routine building inspection was to evaluate the structural integrity, compliance with current safety standards, and overall functionality of the commercial property.

### **4. Observations and Findings**

#### **Structural Integrity**
- The building appears structurally sound, but there are signs of wear and tear consistent with its age (38 years since construction).  
- The reinforced concrete beams in the upper floors show minor cracks, likely due to thermal expansion over the years.

#### **Electrical Systems**
- The electrical wiring is functional but shows signs of overload capacity. Additional circuit breakers may be required for future upgrades.

#### **Plumbing Systems**
- The plumbing system appears to function adequately, but there are visible clogs in some of the older pipes that could potentially cause water damage if left untreated.

#### **Heating and Cooling (HVAC)**
- The HVAC system is operational but energy-efficient ratings are below average for a building of this age. Upgrading to a more efficient system may be advisable.

#### **Fire Safety**
- The fire extinguisher system was tested during the inspection and functions properly. However, the extinguishers are outdated and do not meet current safety standards.

#### **Accessibility**
- The property has basic accessibility features but lacks ramps or elevators for higher-floor units, which could pose challenges for individuals with mobility issues.

### **5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

| **Issue**                     | **Details**                                                                 | **Recommendation**                                                                 |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Structural Integrity            | Reinforced concrete beams show minor cracks.                                | Replace the affected beams to improve long-term structural integrity.              |
| Electrical Systems             | Overload capacity in electrical wiring.                                      | Upgrade circuit breakers and consider rewiring for future-proofing.               |
| Plumbing Systems               | Visible clogs in older pipes.                                                | Schedule professional cleaning or replacement of obstructed pipes.                 |
| HVAC System                   | Inefficient energy consumption.                                              | Upgrade to a more energy-efficient HVAC system.                                  |
| Fire Safety                    | Outdated fire extinguisher system.                                           | Replace the entire fire safety system with modern, compliant equipment.          |
| Accessibility                  | Lack of ramps or elevators for higher-floor units.                          | Install ramps and elevators to improve accessibility compliance.                 |

### **6. Compliance Summary**

The inspection report indicates that the building is in general compliance with local Finnish building regulations but requires updates to meet modern safety standards, particularly in the areas of electrical systems, fire safety, and accessibility. The structural integrity appears adequate for its current use, but proactive maintenance is recommended.

---

### **7. Conclusion**

The commercial property in Virolahti has been assessed as structurally sound with minor issues that do not compromise its operational capacity. While no immediate repairs are required, periodic maintenance should be scheduled to ensure ongoing compliance with building codes and safety standards. Further inspection of the HVAC system is recommended to address energy efficiency concerns.
