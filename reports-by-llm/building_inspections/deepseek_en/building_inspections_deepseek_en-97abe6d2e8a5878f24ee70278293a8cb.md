### **4. Observations and Findings**  
- **Structural Integrity:** The building appears structurally sound, with no visible signs of foundation settling or major beam issues. However, there are minor signs of wear and tear on the exterior wooden panels due to exposure to Finnish winter conditions.  
- **Electrical Systems:** The electrical panel is outdated but functional. There are no immediate safety concerns, but there is room for improvement in energy efficiency.  
- **Plumbing Systems:** The plumbing system appears to be in good condition, with no visible leaks or clogs. However, the pipes are made of older materials that may not meet current standards.  
- **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC):** The HVAC system is functional but shows signs of inefficiency due to age. No major issues were observed during the inspection.  
- **Fire Safety:** The fire safety measures appear adequate for a public building of this type. All emergency exits are operational, and fire extinguishers are maintained in good condition.
