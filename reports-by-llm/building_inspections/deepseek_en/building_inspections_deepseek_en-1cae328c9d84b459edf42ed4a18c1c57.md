### **4. Observations and Findings**

- **Structural Integrity:**  
  - The building appears structurally sound, but there are signs of wear and tear consistent with its age (38 years since construction).  
  - The wooden beams show minor signs of warping, likely due to seasonal changes in temperature and humidity.  

- **Electrical Systems:**  
  - The electrical wiring is outdated and not compliant with current Finnish building regulations. Updates are required for safety and efficiency.  

- **Plumbing Systems:**  
  - The plumbing system appears functional but shows signs of age-related deterioration, particularly in the distribution pipes.  
  - The water heater is over 20 years old and requires replacement to comply with modern safety standards.  

- **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC):**  
  - The HVAC system operates efficiently but lacks energy efficiency ratings. Upgrading this system would reduce energy consumption and costs.  

- **Fire Safety:**  
  - The fire extinguisher is functional but does not meet the latest Finnish fire safety standards. An updated one should be installed immediately.  

- **Accessibility:**  
  - The property has a single staircase, which is adequate for residential use but could be improved to enhance accessibility for individuals with mobility challenges.
