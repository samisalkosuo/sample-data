### **1. General Information**  
- **Country:** Finland  
- **Municipality:** Myrskylä  
- **Address:** Industrivägen 5B, Myrskylä, FI-03710  
- **Inspection Date:** 10.01.2025  
- **Inspector Name:** Mikko Lehto

### **2. Building Overview**  
- **Building Type:** Industrial (e.g., warehouse, factory)  
- **Construction Year:** 2014  
- **Number of Floors:** 3  
- **Primary Materials:** Concrete and steel with brick facades and metal roofing panels  

---

### **3. Inspection Context**  
On the morning of the inspection, the weather conditions were mild but cold, with a slight chance of snow due to Finland's typical wintery climate in January. The temperature was around -5°C (-26°F), making it an ideal time for a routine building inspection. The purpose of this inspection was to evaluate the structural integrity and compliance with local building regulations for an industrial property intended for resale.

### **4. Observations and Findings**  

#### **Structural Integrity**  
- The building appears structurally sound, with no visible signs of foundation settlement or major frame issues. However, the concrete slabs show slight peeling at the edges due to environmental exposure over the years.  

#### **Electrical System**  
- The electrical panel is outdated and requires modernization. There are no live wires in the crawlspace, which could pose a fire hazard if not addressed.  

#### **Plumbing System**  
- The plumbing system appears functional, but there are signs of water damage along the basement walls, likely due to condensation from the inefficient heating system.  

#### **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC)**  
- The HVAC system is operational but energy-efficient. It has a moderate efficiency rating based on its age, and there are no major leaks or insulation issues.  

#### **Fire Safety**  
- The fire extinguisher is functional and in good condition. The sprinkler system was tested during the inspection and operates correctly.  

#### **Accessibility**  
- The property has basic accessibility features but lacks a ramp for wheelchair access to the main entrance. Additionally, the stairs leading to the second floor are uneven and could pose a safety hazard for older residents or visitors.

### **5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**  

| **Issue**                          | **Details**                                                                 | **Recommendation**                                                                 |
|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------:|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| Outdated Electrical Panel           | The panel is 10 years old and requires replacement for safety and efficiency.   | Replace the electrical panel with a modern, energy-efficient model.               |
| Water Damage in Basement            | Visible water stains along basement walls due to condensation from poor heating.| Repairs to the basement walls and foundation to prevent further moisture damage.    |
| Inefficient HVAC System             | The system is 15 years old and has suboptimal energy efficiency ratings.       | Upgrade to a high-efficiency HVAC unit with better insulation for energy savings.|
| Fire Extinguisher Age              | The extinguisher is 8 years old but still functional.                         | No immediate action required unless the extinguisher's functionality is in jeopardy. |
| Flammable Materials in Premises    | Some panels on the exterior and interior are flammable, posing fire risks.   | Replace all flammable materials with non-flammable alternatives.                  |
| Basic Accessibility Features      | Lack of ramp for wheelchair access and uneven stairs.                         | Install a ramp and level the stairs to improve accessibility for all users.        |

### **6. Compliance Summary**  
The building generally complies with local Finnish building regulations, but there are areas where minor upgrades or maintenance are required to ensure long-term safety and efficiency. The primary concerns relate to outdated infrastructure (e.g., electrical panel, HVAC system) and accessibility issues.

---

### **7. Conclusion**  
The industrial building in question has a good overall condition, with no major structural failures that could compromise its integrity. However, routine maintenance and minor upgrades are recommended to address identified issues and ensure compliance with modern building standards. The inspector recommends scheduling follow-up inspections within the next year unless significant changes are made to the property.
