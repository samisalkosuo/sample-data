### **2. Building Overview**  
- **Building Type:** Commercial (e.g., office or retail space)  
- **Construction Year:** 2012  
- **Number of Floors:** 7  
- **Primary Materials:** Stone and concrete with external cladding in brickwork, incorporating thermal insulation systems.  

---

### **3. Inspection Context**  
The inspection was conducted on 25 March 2025 during mild spring weather, characterized by light rain and partly cloudy skies. The temperature was moderate, around 12Â°C, which posed minimal risk of water ingress from condensation but necessitated careful handling of equipment to prevent moisture damage.

### **4. Observations and Findings**  

#### **Structural Integrity:**  
- The building appears structurally sound with no signs of bowing or uneven settlement. However, there are minor cracks in the foundation mortar at the northwest corner, likely due to differential settling during construction.  

#### **Electrical Systems:**  
- The electrical panel is operational and free from faults. The lighting fixtures were functional, but two ceiling fans exhibited signs of wear and tear, requiring replacement within six months for optimal performance.  

#### **Plumbing Systems:**  
- The plumbing system functions adequately, with no leaks detected during the inspection. However, the water supply pipes exhibit slight pitting due to corrosion from residual moisture in the building materials, which is consistent with the age of the infrastructure.  

#### **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC):**  
- The HVAC system operates efficiently, maintaining a comfortable indoor temperature. Minor cracks were observed on the ceiling diffusers, likely caused bycondensation during colder months.  

#### **Fire Safety:**  
- The fire extinguisher is functional and in good condition. Fire safety systems are operational, with no visible signs of damage or wear.  

#### **Accessibility:**  
- The building meets accessibility standards for both service and passenger access. All exits and emergency equipment are functional, though one stairwell handrail near the top floor requires updating to comply fully with current accessibility guidelines.

### **5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**  

1. **Foundation Mortar Cracks (Location: Northwest Corner):**  
   - **Recommendation:** Conduct a full structural assessment to determine if additional stabilization measures are required. If no immediate action is needed, monitor the condition over the next five years.  

2. **Ceiling Fan Wear and Tear (Location: Two Units):**  
   - **Recommendation:** Replace the fans within six months to ensure optimal air circulation and energy efficiency.  

3. **Pitting in Water Supply Pipes (System-wide Issue):**  
   - **Recommendation:** Schedule a comprehensive inspection of all water supply pipes to address corrosion issues, potentially replacing affected components to prevent future leaks.  

4. **Cracks in Ceiling Diffusers (Location: Various Units):**  
   - **Recommendation:** Evaluate the extent of the issue and consider updating the HVAC system or diffuser materials within the next twelve months.  

5. **Handrail Update (Location: Stairwell, Top Floor):**  
   - **Recommendation:** Replace the handrail to ensure compliance with updated accessibility standards before occupancy increases in the coming years.

### **6. Compliance Summary**  
The building complies with local and national construction codes as of 2025. However, minor issues related to material wear and outdated systems indicate that routine maintenance and updates are necessary to maintain long-term functionality and safety.

---

### **7. Conclusion**  
The commercial building in Alavus is structurally sound and functional, meeting current compliance standards. Minor maintenance actions are required to address identified issues without compromising the building's integrity or safety. Follow-up inspections should be scheduled within six months to ensure ongoing compliance and address any emerging concerns.
