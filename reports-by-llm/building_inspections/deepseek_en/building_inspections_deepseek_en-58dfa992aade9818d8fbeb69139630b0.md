### **4. Observations and Findings**

#### **Structural Integrity**  
- The building appears structurally sound with no signs of major subsidence or bowing in the walls.  
- The foundation is intact and reinforced, indicating that it has been designed to withstand lateral forces typical for a commercial building of this age.  

#### **Electrical System**  
- The electrical panel is operational but shows signs of wear on the terminal blocks due to extended use over the years.  
- All essential circuits are functional, including lighting, heating, and cooling systems.  

#### **Water and sewer Systems**  
- The water supply system functions correctly, with no leaks detected in the pipes or fixtures.  
- The sewage system is operational, but there are visible stains on the floor tiles in the basement area due to years of untreated wastewater.  

#### **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC)**  
- The HVAC system operates efficiently, maintaining a comfortable temperature range inside the building.  
- There are no signs of condensation or moisture buildup in the ductwork, indicating proper insulation and ventilation.  

#### **Fire Safety**  
- The fire extinguisher is functional and positioned appropriately for emergency response.  
- All fire safety regulations appear to be adhered to, including regular maintenance checks on smoke detectors and alarms.  

#### **Accessibility**  
- The building has a single staircase with handrails on both sides, meeting accessibility standards for commercial spaces.  
- The elevator is operational and accessible to all floors, though it requires manual operation due to outdated technology.

### **5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

| **Issue**                                                                 | **Recommendation**                                                                 |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Visible stains on basement floor tiles from untreated wastewater.       | Replace the basement floor tiles with moisture-resistant materials immediately.     |
| Outdated HVAC system requiring frequent maintenance.                     | Replace or upgrade the HVAC system to meet modern energy efficiency standards.    |
| Handrail on the staircase is loose and unsafe for elderly or disabled users.| Reinforce the handrails or replace them with new, compliantly designed ones.       |

### **6. Compliance Summary**

The building complies with Finnish national building regulations in terms of structural integrity, electrical systems, and fire safety. However, it does not fully comply with updated local regulations regarding water management (stain on basement floors) and HVAC efficiency.

- **Structural Integrity:** Fully compliant.  
- **Electrical System:** Mostly compliant; minor wear on terminal blocks.  
- **Water and sewer Systems:** Partially compliant due to stains in the basement.  
- **HVAC System:** Non-compliant with modern energy efficiency standards.  
- **Fire Safety:** Fully compliant.  

---

### **7. Conclusion**

The building is in good overall condition, with no immediate safety risks. However, there are areas for improvement regarding water management and HVAC efficiency. It is recommended to address the stains on the basement floor tiles immediately and upgrade the HVAC system to meet current standards.
