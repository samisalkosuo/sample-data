### **4. Observations and Findings**

#### **Structural Integrity**
- The building appears structurally sound with no visible signs of uplift or cracking in the foundation walls. However, there are minor signs of moisture damage around the basement entrance, likely due to condensation from adjacent structures.

#### **Electrical System**
- The electrical panel is operational and free from faults. All circuits are correctly labeled and tested. No major issues were observed with wiring or appliances.

#### **Water Supply**
- The water supply system is functioning properly. The main valve is closed, and there are no leaks detected in the pipes. However, the water pressure in the upper floors is slightly reduced due to an outdated pump system that requires attention.

#### **Heating and Cooling System**
- The heating system operates efficiently with no significant issues. The oil boiler (installed in 1982) functions well but shows signs of wear on the radiators.
- The cooling system, installed in 1978, is operational and effective for the local climate.

#### **Plumbing System**
- The plumbing system appears to be in good condition with no major leaks or clogs. However, there are a few cracked pipes in the kitchen that could potentially lead to water damage if not addressed.

#### **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC)**
- The HVAC system is functioning correctly and maintaining a comfortable indoor temperature. No issues were observed during the inspection.

#### **Fire Safety**
- The fire extinguisher is functional and in good condition.
- All emergency exits are clear of obstructions, and smoke detectors are operational.

#### **Accessibility**
- The building has basic accessibility features, including a staircase with handrails and a ramp for轮椅 users. However, there are no elevators installed, which could be an issue for older residents or those with mobility challenges.

### **5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

1. **Water Pressure Issue**  
   - **Issue:** The outdated pump system in the water supply is causing reduced pressure on upper floors.  
   - **Recommendation:** Replace the pump system with a more efficient one to ensure consistent water pressure throughout the building.  

2. **Cracked Pipes in Plumbing System**  
   - **Issue:** Several cracked pipes in the kitchen area could lead to water damage if not addressed.  
   - **Recommendation:** Repair or replace the affected pipes to prevent future leaks and potential health hazards.  

3. **Old HVAC System**  
   - **Issue:** The HVAC system, installed in 1978, is showing signs of wear but still functions adequately.  
   - **Recommendation:** Consider upgrading the HVAC system to improve energy efficiency and comfort levels.  

4. **No Elevators for Disabled Access**  
   - **Issue:** Lack of elevators makes accessing upper floors difficult for individuals with mobility challenges.  
   - **Recommendation:** Install elevators in all residential units to ensure accessibility compliance.  

5. **Condensation at Basement Entrance**  
   - **Issue:** Minor moisture damage around the basement entrance due to condensation from adjacent structures.  
   - **Recommendation:** Seal the basement entrance with a moisture-resistant sealant to prevent further moisture-related issues.

### **6. Compliance Summary**

The building generally complies with local and national building regulations, but there are areas requiring attention. The primary non-compliance relates to outdated infrastructure (e.g., HVAC system, water supply) that requires modernization. The inspection team recommends upgrading these systems to ensure long-term compliance and safety.

---

### **7. Conclusion**

The residential property at 123 Veteli Street is in good overall condition, with no structural failures or immediate safety risks. However, there are several areas requiring attention for improvement to enhance the building's functionality, safety, and energy efficiency. The inspection team recommends addressing the identified issues promptly to ensure compliance with modern building standards.
