### **3. Inspection Context**  
The inspection was conducted on 01.01.2025 in Perho, Finland, during a snowy weather condition. The temperature was -5Â°C, and light snowfall was expected for the following day. The purpose of this inspection was to conduct a routine structural check to ensure compliance with current Finnish building codes and recommendations.

### **4. Observations and Findings**  
- **Structural Integrity:** The building appears structurally sound overall but shows signs of wear and tear consistent with its age (38 years since construction). Minor cracks in the wooden beams were observed, which are likely due to environmental factors.  
- **Roof Condition:** The metal roof sheets show signs of corrosion, particularly along the edges where they connect to the wooden structure. This could lead to water infiltration if not addressed promptly.  
- **Foundation Issues:** Slight uneven settling has been detected in the concrete foundation, which may affect long-term structural stability and alignment with neighboring buildings.  
- **Electrical System:** The electrical panel is outdated and requires modernization to comply with current Finnish safety regulations. Additional circuit breakers and updated wiring are needed.  
- **Plumbing Systems:** The plumbing system shows signs of age-related clogs in the pipes, particularly in the workshop area. A full cleaning and inspection of the pipe network are recommended.  
- **Heating and Cooling (HVAC):** The HVAC system is operational but inefficient due to outdated components. Upgrading to a more energy-efficient system is advisable for future use.  
- **Fire Safety:** The building lacks adequate fire safety measures, including smoke detectors and automatic fire suppression systems. Immediate upgrades are required to meet current regulations.  
- **Accessibility:** The building has limited accessibility features, making it difficult for older workers to navigate the premises easily. Rearranging certain areas or installing additional handrails could improve accessibility.

### **5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**  
1. **Roof Corrosion:** Replace or repair the metal roof sheets at the edges to prevent water infiltration.  
2. **Foundation Uneven Settling:** Conduct a professional survey to determine the extent of settling and implement stabilizing measures if necessary.  
3. **Outdated Electrical System:** Modernize the electrical panel, install additional circuit breakers, and update wiring according to current regulations.  
4. **Plumbing Clogs:** Clean or replace all clogged pipes in the plumbing system, particularly in the workshop area.  
5. **Inefficient HVAC System:** Upgrade the HVAC system to a more energy-efficient model for improved performance and future-proofing.  
6. **Fire Safety Deficiencies:** Install automatic fire suppression systems and smoke detectors throughout the building.  
7. **Accessibility Improvements:** Assess and enhance accessibility features, such as rearranging workspaces or installing handrails, to improve worker mobility.

### **6. Compliance Summary**  
The inspection revealed that the building does not fully comply with current Finnish building codes due to outdated materials, systems, and safety measures. Significant recommendations have been identified to ensure compliance with updated regulations.  

---

### **7. Conclusion**  
The industrial building in Perho is in satisfactory overall condition but requires several key upgrades to meet modern standards. Immediate action on the listed recommendations will enhance its safety, efficiency, and long-term stability. Follow-up inspections should be scheduled within six months to verify the effectiveness of the implemented fixes.
