### **1. General Information**  
- **Country:** Finland  
- **Municipality:** Siuntio  
- **Address:** Industriiltori 56, Siuntio  
- **Inspection Date:** 23.06.2025 (DD.MM.YYYY)  
- **Inspector Name:** Mika Salo

### **2. Building Overview**  
- **Building Type:** Industrial  
- **Construction Year:** 2021  
- **Number of Floors:** 2  
- **Primary Materials:** Reinforced concrete, steel structures, and insulation panels  

---

### **3. Inspection Context**  
The inspection was conducted on 23 June 2025 during mild summer weather in Siuntio. The temperature was approximately 22°C (71°F), with partly cloudy skies. The purpose of the inspection was to evaluate the structural integrity and compliance of the building for potential resale or renovation purposes.

### **4. Observations and Findings**  

#### **Structural Integrity**  
- The foundation exhibits signs of subsidence, likely due to differential settling over the past five years.  
- The second floor beams show minor cracks consistent with fatigue from prolonged exposure to environmental factors.  

#### **Electrical System**  
- The electrical wiring is outdated and not fully compliant with current Finnish building regulations. Replacing the circuit breakers and upgrading the fuse system are recommended.  

#### **Plumbing System**  
- The water supply pipes exhibit light corrosion, likely caused by chloride contamination from local groundwater. A protective coating application is advised.  
- The drainage system appears to function adequately, but a minor leak was detected in one of the service pipes.  

#### **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC)**  
- The HVAC system operates efficiently under normal conditions but shows signs of reduced efficiency during extreme temperatures. A tune-up is recommended.  

#### **Fire Safety**  
- The fire extinguisher system meets current standards, but the extinguishers are overdue for servicing. Upgrading to a Class A-rated system is advised.  

#### **Accessibility**  
- The building has minimal accessibility issues due to uneven flooring and narrow staircases. A ramp installation in the entrance area would improve inclusivity.

### **5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**  

| **Issue**                          | **Recommendation**                                                                 |
|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Subsidence in the foundation         | Replace the foundation with a reinforced concrete slab or install underpinnings.     |
| Outdated electrical wiring           | Upgrade the circuit breakers, fuses, and control panels.                        |
| Corrosion in water supply pipes       | Apply a protective coating to the pipes to prevent further corrosion.              |
| Minor leak in drainage system        | Repair the leaking pipe or install a new one as part of a larger renovation project.  |
| Reduced HVAC efficiency             | Schedule a professional tune-up to optimize performance and energy efficiency.    |
| Overdue fire extinguisher servicing  | Service the existing extinguishers and consider upgrading to a Class A-rated system.|
| Narrow staircases                   | Install a ramp in the entrance area during the next renovation or modernization project.|

### **6. Compliance Summary**  
The building generally complies with Finnish building regulations, but several areas require attention to ensure long-term safety and efficiency. Key compliance points include:  
- **Structural Integrity:** Partially compliant due to subsidence and outdated materials.  
- **Electrical System:** Non-compliant due to outdated wiring.  
- **Plumbing System:** Mostly compliant with minor maintenance required.  
- **HVAC System:** Mostly compliant but needs tuning.  
- **Fire Safety:** Mostly compliant, but fire extinguishers need servicing.  

---

### **7. Conclusion**  
The building is in satisfactory overall condition for its intended use as an industrial facility. However, several areas require immediate attention to ensure compliance with Finnish building codes and to prevent potential safety hazards. A comprehensive renovation or modernization project should be scheduled within the next 12 months to address these issues fully.
