### **4. Observations and Findings**

#### **Structural Integrity**
- The industrial building appears structurally sound, with no visible signs of sagging or warping in its steel beams.
- The foundation remains stable, supported by a reinforced concrete structure beneath the building.

#### **Electrical Systems**
- The electrical panel is operational but shows signs of wear and tear on the wiring. Replacing outdated circuit breakers and upgrading the circuit breaker panel are recommended to align with current Finnish standards.

#### **Plumbing Systems**
- The plumbing system functions adequately, though there are signs of mildew growth on the pipes due to insufficient ventilation. Updating the plumbing system with more efficient materials is advised.

#### **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC)**
- The HVAC system operates efficiently but shows signs of inefficiency in heating during colder months. Upgrading to a more energy-efficient system could reduce operational costs.

#### **Fire Safety**
- Fire extinguishers are present and functional, but the fire extinguisher system map is outdated. An updated inspection of all fire safety equipment and alarms is recommended.

#### **Accessibility**
- The building meets accessibility standards for industrial use, with adequate pathways and handrails. However, there are minor creaks in the wooden floor beams that could be addressed during future maintenance.
