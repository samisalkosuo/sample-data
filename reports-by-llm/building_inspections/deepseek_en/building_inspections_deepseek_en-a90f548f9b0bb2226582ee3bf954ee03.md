### **1. General Information**  
- **Country:** Finland  
- **Municipality:** Kumlinge  
- **Address:** House No. 45, P.O. Box 389, Kumlinge, FI-99600 Lapland  
- **Inspection Date:** 07.05.2025 (DD.MM.YYYY)  
- **Inspector Name:** Anna Svensson

### **2. Building Overview**  
- **Building Type:** Public residential building  
- **Construction Year:** 1981  
- **Number of Floors:** 6  
- **Primary Materials:** Cinder block walls, reinforced concrete floors, aluminum windows and doors, wood-framed roof with insulation, asphalt shingles  

---

### **3. Inspection Context**  
The inspection was conducted on 07 May 2025 during a routine building check for potential resale in Lapland, known for its cold climate and stringent building codes. Weather conditions included partly cloudy skies with light snowfall, temperatures hovering around -5°C to -8°C, which impacted insulation performance.

### **4. Observations and Findings**  

#### **Structural Integrity**  
- The building appears structurally sound overall, with no immediate signs of bowing or leaning in the walls or foundation. However, the wooden beams supporting the second floor (floors 2–5) show signs of wear and tear consistent with their age. These beams were constructed during the '80s and may require replacement within the next decade to ensure long-term stability.

#### **Electrical Systems**  
- The electrical panel is operational but shows signs of inefficiency, likely due to outdated wiring in several apartments. This could pose a risk if appliances are operated simultaneously or if future upgrades are required for energy efficiency standards.

#### **Plumbing Systems**  
- The plumbing system appears functional and meets basic requirements. However, the pipes in the bathrooms (floors 2–5) exhibit signs of mildew growth, likely due to poor ventilation and insufficient drainage systems.

#### **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC)**  
- The HVAC units are operational but show signs of inefficiency, with higher energy consumption compared to modern standards. The ductwork is in good condition, but the air filters on all units need replacement within six months to improve indoor air quality.

#### **Fire Safety**  
- The fire safety systems are functional and meet current regulations. However, the insulation in the attic (floor 6) shows signs of degradation, which could compromise thermal performance during extreme cold spells.

#### **Accessibility**  
- The staircase on floor 5 is slightly uneven, posing a minor risk to older residents or individuals with mobility challenges. A small step adjustment would improve accessibility compliance with local building codes.

### **5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**  

| **Issue**                                | **Recommendation**                                                                 |
|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Outdated wooden beams (floors 2–5)         | Replace beams with modern steel or wood composite beams within the next five years.    |
| Inefficient electrical wiring               | Upgrade electrical panel and wiring to meet current energy efficiency standards.     |
| Mildew growth in bathrooms (floors 2–5)   | Improve ventilation and install new, moisture-resistant pipes.                     |
| Inefficient HVAC system                   | Replace air filters every six months and consider upgrading the HVAC units.         |
| Uneven staircase on floor 5               | Adjust step height to meet local accessibility standards.                         |
| Attic insulation degradation (floor 6)     | Replace or reinforce attic insulation with high-temperature-resistant materials.    |

### **6. Compliance Summary**  
The building generally complies with current Finnish building regulations, but several areas require updates to ensure long-term compliance and safety. The primary risks are related to outdated structural components and inefficient systems.

---

### **7. Conclusion**  
The building is in good overall condition for its age, but it requires modernization to meet current standards. Annual inspections should be scheduled to address any emerging issues. If the owner opts to renovate or resell, immediate action on the recommended upgrades will ensure compliance with local regulations and enhance the property's value.
