### **4. Observations and Findings**  

#### **Structural Integrity:**  
- The building appears structurally sound, with no visible signs of foundation settlement or major frame issues. However, the steel beams supporting the second floor are outdated and require replacement due to their limited load-bearing capacity as per current engineering standards.

#### **Electrical System:**  
- The electrical panel is functional but outdated, operating on a 220V three-phase system that is no longer compliant with Finnish Building Codes (FBC). Updates to the circuit breakers and wiring are recommended.

#### **Plumbing System:**  
- The plumbing system functions adequately for industrial use, but the water softener installed in 2019 requires periodic maintenance. No major issues were observed during the inspection.

#### **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC):**  
- The HVAC system is operational and meets basic requirements for temperature control. However, annual service checks are recommended to ensure optimal performance and compliance with FBC standards.

#### **Fire Safety:**  
- The fire detection systems were functional during the inspection, but the age of the smoke detectors necessitates replacement. The automatic sprinkler system was functioning correctly and had been tested recently.

#### **Accessibility:**  
- The building has a single staircase leading to the second floor, which is difficult for individuals with mobility challenges. A ramp or additional handrails should be installed to comply with accessibility standards.

### **5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**  

| **Issue**                                                                 | **Recommendation**                                                                 |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Outdated steel beams (2023 construction, designed for 1998 load capacities). | Replace the beams with modern, load-bearing steel structures compliant with FBC.    |
| Non-compliant three-phase electrical system.                              | Upgrade to a two-phase system or install additional circuit breakers as per FBC.   |
| Insufficient maintenance of water softener.                               | Schedule periodic inspections and replacements for the water softener unit.        |
| Age-appropriate HVAC system.                                              | Annual service checks and potential upgrades to meet current energy efficiency standards. |
| Obsolete fire detection systems (detectors are 10 years old).             | Replace smoke detectors with modern, energy-efficient models.                       |
| Handicapped access via stairs.                                            | Install a ramp or modify the staircase to comply with accessibility regulations.   |

### **6. Compliance Summary**  
The building is in good overall condition and meets most of the criteria outlined in Finland’s Building Codes (FBC). Minor updates, such as replacing outdated beams and updating the electrical system, are required to ensure full compliance.

---

### **7. Conclusion**  
The Ylivieska Industrial Estate, Building A, was inspected on 05.01.2025 and found to be structurally sound with minor issues that do not compromise its safety or stability. The building is in satisfactory condition for its intended use but requires routine maintenance and minor repairs to fully comply with current building regulations.

A follow-up inspection is recommended within six months to ensure all modifications are implemented and the HVAC system remains operational.
