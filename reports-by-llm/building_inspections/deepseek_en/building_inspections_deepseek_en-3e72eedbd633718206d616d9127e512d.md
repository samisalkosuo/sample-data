### **3. Inspection Context**  
The inspection was conducted on 19 April 2025 in Iitti, Finland. The weather conditions were mild with a temperature of approximately 10°C (50°F), and there was light precipitation. The purpose of the inspection was to conduct a routine structural evaluation of the commercial building to ensure compliance with current Finnish building regulations.

### **4. Observations and Findings**  
- **Structural Integrity:** The building appears structurally sound, but there are signs of wear and tear consistent with its age (2007). The foundation is in good condition, but cavity walls exhibit minor signs of moisture penetration.  
- **Electrical System:** The electrical panel is outdated and requires modernization to meet current Finnish electrical codes. There are no immediate safety concerns, but efficiency improvements could be considered.  
- **Water Leakage:** A small water leak was detected near the foundation on the first floor. This appears to be related to moisture from the exterior walls.  
- **Heating, Ventilation, and Cooling (HVAC):** The HVAC system is functional but shows signs of inefficiency. Regular maintenance could enhance energy performance.  
- **Fire Safety:** The fire extinguisher system is functional, but the sprinkler system requires annual testing as per Finnish regulations.  
- **Accessibility:** The building has basic accessibility features, including a ramp and elevator access for the first floor. However, stairs to higher floors are not ADA compliant and pose a risk for individuals with mobility challenges.

### **5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**  
1. **Structural Concerns:**  
   - Cavity walls require sealing to prevent moisture ingress (Action: Retain wall lining or apply cavity wall insulation).  
2. **Electrical System:**  
   - Update electrical panel to meet current codes (Action: Modernize wiring and components within 6 months).  
3. **Water Leakage:**  
   - Address foundation moisture issues through improved drainage systems (Action: Install new downspouts and soil vapor barriers).  
4. **HVAC Efficiency:**  
   - Upgrade HVAC system or implement energy-efficient controls (Action: Evaluate options for improvement in the next year).  
5. **Fire Safety:**  
   - Schedule annual inspection of sprinkler system (Action: Contact local fire safety authority by end of May).  
6. **Accessibility:**  
   - Convert stairs to higher floors into ramps (Action: Begin construction within 3 months).

### **6. Compliance Summary**  
The building complies with current Finnish building regulations, but several areas require deferred maintenance to ensure long-term structural integrity and safety. The primary deficiencies are related to outdated materials and systems that no longer meet modern codes.

---

### **7. Conclusion**  
The commercial building in Iitti is structurally sound but requires attention to modernize its electrical system, address water leakage, improve HVAC efficiency, and enhance accessibility features. Immediate action is recommended for the electrical panel and cavity wall sealing, while deferred maintenance should be scheduled for other components.
