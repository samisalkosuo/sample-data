### **2. Building Overview**  
- **Building Type:** Industrial (Factory)  
- **Construction Year:** 2016  
- **Number of Floors:** 3  
- **Primary Materials:** Steel frame with concrete floors and metal roofing, insulated with rigid foam panels.  

---

### **3. Inspection Context**  
The inspection was conducted on 22 December 2024 during a snowy weather condition typical for Lapland in late December. The building underwent a routine structural check to ensure compliance with local building regulations.  

---

### **4. Observations and Findings**  

#### **Structural Integrity**  
- The steel frame appears structurally sound, but there are signs of wear on the bolts at the foundation level due to years of use.  
- The concrete floors show minor cracks in the slab, likely caused by thermal expansion over time.  

#### **Electrical Systems**  
- The electrical wiring is outdated and requires modernization to meet current Finnish building codes. Specifically, the circuit breakers are at capacity limits for future expansion.  

#### **Plumbing Systems**  
- The plumbing system shows signs of water damage on the ceiling due to condensation from the north-facing roof. This may be related to insufficient insulation in the walls.  

#### **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC)**  
- The HVAC system is functional but energy-efficient ratings are below current standards. Upgrading to a more efficient model is recommended.  

#### **Fire Safety**  
- The fire extinguisher system appears to be in good condition, but the last inspection was conducted in 2018. Additional training for staff may be required.  

#### **Accessibility**  
- The building has basic accessibility features, including a ramp at the entrance and grab bars in the bathroom. However, the main staircase lacks handrails on both sides of the steps.

### **5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**  

| **Issue**                                                                 | **Recommendation**                                                                 |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Outdated electrical wiring and circuit breakers.                         | Replace with updated wiring and ensure compliance with 2023 Finnish building codes.   |
| Minor cracks in concrete floors at the foundation level.                  | Repair or replace the affected concrete slabs to prevent further structural issues.    |
| Water damage on the ceiling due to condensation from the roof.           | Upgrade the insulation in the north-facing walls for better thermal performance.      |
| Fire extinguisher system last inspected in 2018, with no recent maintenance.| Conduct a full fire safety inspection and update the extinguisher system as needed.    |
| Basic accessibility features without adequate handrails on the staircase.| Install handrails on both sides of all staircases to improve accessibility for all users. |

### **6. Compliance Summary**  
The building partially complies with current Finnish building regulations but requires several upgrades to meet modern standards. Key areas needing attention include electrical systems, insulation, and fire safety measures.  

---

### **7. Conclusion**  
The industrial building in Vesilahti is structurally sound but shows signs of age-related wear and outdated systems. Immediate action is recommended for the electrical wiring and HVAC system to ensure compliance with updated building codes. Regular maintenance and upgrades are essential to prevent further issues.
