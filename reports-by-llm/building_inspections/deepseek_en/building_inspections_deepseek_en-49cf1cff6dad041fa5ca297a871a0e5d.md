---

### **3. Inspection Context**  
The inspection was conducted on 24 September 2024, during the fall/winter season in Lapland, where temperatures typically range between -5°C and 5°C due to the cold northern climate. The weather conditions were partly cloudy with light winds, which could affect structural stability and insulation performance.

### **4. Observations and Findings**  

#### **Structural Integrity**  
- The building appears structurally sound overall but shows signs of wear consistent with its age (2021 construction). Minor cracks in the metal frame were observed on inspection.  

#### **Electrical Systems**  
- The electrical panel is outdated, requiring modernization to comply with current Finnish building codes. Several light fixtures are non-functional due to aged wiring.  

#### **Plumbing Systems**  
- The plumbing system appears functional but could benefit from a minor upgrade to improve efficiency and reduce water losses.  

#### **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC)**  
- The HVAC system is operational but shows signs of inefficiency. Regular maintenance is recommended to optimize energy consumption.  

#### **Fire Safety**  
- Fire extinguishers are present but not in fully functional condition. Additional fire blankets should be installed to enhance safety measures.  

#### **Accessibility**  
- The building has basic accessibility features, including a single staircase and grab bars in the bath areas. However, the stairs are narrow and could pose a risk for individuals with mobility issues.
