### **4. Observations and Findings**  

#### **Structural Integrity**  
- The building appears structurally sound, with no visible signs of foundation settlement or major frame distortions.  
- The steel beams are in good condition, though they show minor signs of pitting due to environmental factors.  

#### **Electrical Systems**  
- The electrical panel is operational and meets current Finnish standards for safety and efficiency.  
- There are two outdated 10-year-old transformers that require replacement to comply with updated energy regulations.  

#### **Plumbing Systems**  
- The plumbing system functions correctly, with all pipes in good condition and no visible leaks.  
- The water softener installed in 2015 is still operational but requires regular maintenance to ensure optimal performance.  

#### **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC)**  
- The HVAC system operates efficiently, with no signs of malfunctions or wear and tear.  
- The cooling coil shows minor discoloration due to years of use but remains functional.  

#### **Fire Safety**  
- The fire extinguisher is in good condition and functional.  
- The sprinkler system was tested during the inspection and confirmed to be operational. However, the last maintenance check for the sprinklers was conducted in 2016, and they require periodic inspection due to aging components.  

#### **Accessibility**  
- The building has two emergency exits, one of which is non-compliant with Finnish accessibility standards (it lacks a handrail). A new exit will need to be installed as part of the renovation project.  
- The staircase leading to the second floor is in good condition but requires modernization to comply with current safety regulations.

### **5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**  
1. **Two outdated transformers (2013)**: These must be replaced to ensure compliance with updated energy standards.  
2. **Fire extinguisher maintenance**: The current fire extinguisher is older than the last inspection in 2019; it should be replaced or inspected by a certified professional.  
3. **Non-compliant emergency exit (2016)**: A new exit must be installed to meet Finnish accessibility standards.  
4. **Modernized staircase**: The existing staircase requires renovation to comply with current safety regulations.

### **6. Compliance Summary**  
The building generally complies with Finnish building codes and local regulations, but several components require attention to ensure long-term functionality and safety. The primary non-compliance relates to outdated fire safety equipment and accessibility issues.

---

### **7. Conclusion**  
The industrial building in Pirkkala is structurally sound and functional, but it requires updates to its electrical systems, fire safety equipment, and accessibility features to fully comply with current regulations. Immediate action should be taken to address the identified issues to prevent potential safety hazards and ensure the building remains habitable for its intended use.
