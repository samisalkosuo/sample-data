### **1. General Information**  
- **Country:** Finland  
- **Municipality:** Ruovesi  
- **Address:** Industriv√§gen 5B, Ruovesi, FI-76340  
- **Inspection Date:** 21.02.2025 (DD.MM.YYYY)  
- **Inspector Name:** Anna-Maria Kivipelto

### **2. Building Overview**  
- **Building Type:** Industrial (e.g., warehouse, factory)  
- **Construction Year:** 1999  
- **Number of Floors:** 3  
- **Primary Materials:** Steel frame with concrete floors and walls; secondary materials include galvanized steel beams and insulation panels.  

---

### **3. Inspection Context**  
The inspection was conducted on 21 February 2025 during a cold winter day in Lapland, where temperatures dropped below freezing. The weather conditions were mild but included light snowfall, which could impact the building's structural integrity if not properly reinforced.

The purpose of this inspection was to evaluate the overall condition of the industrial facility and ensure compliance with current Finnish building codes.  

---

### **4. Observations and Findings**  
- **Structural Integrity:** The steel frame appears structurally sound, but there are signs of wear on the galvanized beams due to years of exposure to Lapland's climate. No immediate threats to safety were observed during the inspection.  
- **Electrical Systems:** The electrical panel is operational but outdated; rewiring may be required to meet modern standards.  
- **Plumbing Systems:** The plumbing system functions correctly, with no leaks or clogs detected. However, the pipes are nearing the end of their usable lifespan and require replacement.  
- **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC):** The HVAC system is functional but shows signs of inefficiency in heating during colder months. Annual maintenance is recommended to optimize performance.  
- **Fire Safety:** The fire safety systems, including smoke detectors and fire extinguishers, are functioning properly. Fire panels on the walls were inspected and confirmed to be intact.  
- **Accessibility:** The building has basic accessibility features but lacks a ramp or elevator for easier access for individuals with mobility challenges.

### **5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**  
1. **Electrical Panel:** Needs modernization to comply with current Finnish electrical codes, potentially requiring rewiring (Recommendation: 1).  
2. **Plumbing System:** Pipes are nearing replacement; immediate action is required to prevent future issues (Recommendation: 2).  
3. **HVAC System:** Annual maintenance is recommended to improve efficiency and reduce energy consumption (Recommendation: 3).  
4. **Fire Safety Panels:** No immediate issues, but regular testing is advisable (Recommendation: 4).  
5. **Accessibility:** A ramp or elevator should be installed to enhance inclusivity (Recommendation: 5).  

---

### **6. Compliance Summary**  
The building generally complies with Finnish building regulations, but several components are nearing the end of their usable lifespan and require modernization or replacement. The facility is in good condition overall but does not meet all current standards for safety, efficiency, and accessibility.  

---

### **7. Conclusion**  
The industrial facility in Ruovesi has a satisfactory overall condition and meets most compliance requirements. However, to ensure long-term functionality, modernization of electrical systems, replacement of aging plumbing fixtures, annual HVAC maintenance, and improved accessibility features are recommended. The inspector will follow up with the relevant authorities to address the identified issues promptly.
