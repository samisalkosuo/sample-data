### **4. Observations and Findings**  

#### **Structural Integrity**  
- The building appears structurally sound with no visible signs of foundation settlement or major frame issues. However, the brickwork on the second floor shows minor peeling due to environmental factors over the years.  

#### **Electrical Systems**  
- The wiring is outdated and requires modernization (e.g., updated circuit breakers and receptacles). There are no obvious electrical faults but insufficient circuit protection for modern appliances.  

#### **Plumbing Systems**  
- The plumbing system appears functional, with proper circulation of water through the radiating pipes. However, there are signs of mildew growth on the shower walls due to inadequate ventilation and poor insulation in the bathroom.  

#### **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC)**  
- The HVAC system is operational but shows signs of inefficiency, with higher energy consumption compared to modern standards. The air conditioning unit was slightly degraded during operation last winter.  

#### **Fire Safety**  
- Fire extinguishers are present and functional. The fire safety rating of the building complies with current Finnish regulations (Class 1). However, there is no smoke detector in the master bedroom, which should be installed as part of a routine inspection.  

#### **Accessibility**  
- The staircase leading to the second floor has handrails in good condition but lacks grab bars on both sides for added safety. The landing area at the top of the stairs is slightly damp due to condensation from the bathroom.

### **5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**  
1. **Electrical Systems:** Replace outdated wiring with modern, energy-efficient standards.  
2. **Plumbing Systems:** Improve ventilation in the bathroom to reduce mildew growth.  
3. **HVAC System:** Upgrade to a more efficient model to meet current energy standards.  
4. **Fire Safety:** Install smoke detectors in all bedrooms and ensure all fire extinguishers are functional.  
5. **Accessibility:** Add grab bars on both sides of the staircase handrails and improve drainage in the landing area.  

---

### **6. Compliance Summary**  
The building complies with current Finnish building regulations for structural integrity, electrical safety, and fire safety. However, it does not meet modern standards for plumbing efficiency, HVAC system performance, or accessibility features. Regular maintenance and updates are recommended to ensure long-term functionality and compliance with future regulations.  

---

### **7. Conclusion**  
The residential building in Karkkila is in good overall condition, with no structural issues that would compromise safety. However, it requires attention to modernize electrical systems, improve plumbing efficiency, upgrade HVAC equipment, and enhance accessibility features. Annual inspections should continue to monitor the building's health and ensure compliance with current standards.
