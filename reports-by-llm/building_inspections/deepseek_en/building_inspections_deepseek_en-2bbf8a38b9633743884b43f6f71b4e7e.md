### **4. Observations and Findings**

#### **Structural Integrity**  
- The building appears structurally sound with no signs of immediate collapse or instability. All load-bearing walls and beams are intact.  

#### **Electrical System**  
- The electrical wiring is in good condition, but there are minor signs of wear on the circuit breakers. No unauthorized modifications to the system have been observed.  

#### **Plumbing System**  
- The plumbing system functions adequately, with no leaks or clogs detected during the inspection. However, there are a few small stains visible on the walls due to condensation from the heating system.  

#### **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC)**  
- The HVAC system is operational but slightly inefficient, requiring additional energy input than specified in the building code.  

#### **Fire Safety**  
- Fire extinguishers are present and functional. The fire extinguisher cabinet is in good condition, and all emergency exits have working signage.  

#### **Accessibility**  
- The property has basic accessibility features, including a ramp at the entrance and grab bars in the bathrooms. However, the staircase leading to the upper floors lacks handrails for safer navigation by older residents.

### **5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

| **Issue**                          | **Details**                                                                 | **Recommendation**                                                                 |
|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------:|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| Peeling paint on building façade     | Visible peeling on the frosted glass façade, likely due to UV exposure.   | Repaint the exterior facade with a protective coating or replace the glass panes. |
| Small cracks in glass facets        | Minor cracks observed on the frosted glass windows, affecting aesthetics.  | Repair or replace the affected glass panes as per building code requirements.     |
| Outdated wiring system              | Circuit breakers are slightly worn but functional; no unauthorized changes.  | Upgrade to modern circuit protection devices (e.g., gfcb) for enhanced safety.   |
| Minor water stains on interior walls | Visible water stains from condensation in the heating system.                | Improve the HVAC efficiency or install additional ventilation systems.            |
| Inefficient HVAC system             | Current system meets basic requirements, but energy consumption is higher than optimal.  | Upgrade to a more efficient HVAC unit to reduce operational costs and carbon footprint.|
| Worn-out stairs                       | Stairs in the upper floors lack handrails; steps are uneven with safety risks.  | Replace or repair the stairs to include handrails for safer navigation.            |

### **6. Compliance Summary**

The building complies with current Finnish building regulations, but minor upgrades are recommended based on the findings:

- Upgrade the HVAC system to a more energy-efficient model.
- Replace outdated circuit breakers with gfcb devices.
- Paint the exterior façade or repair/replace affected glass panes for better aesthetics and safety.

---

### **7. Conclusion**

The Akaa Business Park, Building No. 78, is in good overall structural condition and meets current compliance standards. Minor maintenance and upgrades are recommended to enhance its functionality, safety, and energy efficiency.  

**Recommendation:** Conduct a follow-up inspection within six months after implementing the suggested upgrades to ensure long-term compliance and safety.
