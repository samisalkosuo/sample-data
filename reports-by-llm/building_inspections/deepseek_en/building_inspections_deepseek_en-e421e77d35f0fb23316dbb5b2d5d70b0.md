### **3. Inspection Context**
On the morning of the inspection (18 September 2024), Raahe experienced mild weather conditions with occasional rain showers typical for the region in late summer. The inspector conducted the examination at the premises of "Raahe Industrial Complex," a well-established facility known for its durability and reliability.

The purpose of this inspection was to evaluate the structural integrity, compliance with building regulations, and overall safety of the facility as it pertains to its continued operation and potential resale value.

### **4. Observations and Findings**
- **Structural Integrity**: The building appears structurally sound with no signs of immediate deterioration or instability.
- **Electrical Systems**: The electrical panel is operational but shows signs of wear and tear on the wiring connections, particularly in the control panels located on floors 5 and 7.
- **Plumbing Systems**: The plumbing system functions adequately, though there are visible water stains on the ceiling tiles around the service entrance. Further investigation revealed that these stains are likely due to condensation from high humidity levels during warmer months.
- **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC)**: The HVAC units operate efficiently but show signs of inefficiency in their energy consumption patterns. The system is not fully compliant with current energy efficiency standards.
- **Fire Safety**: The fire safety systems are operational and functional. However, the automatic sprinkler system on floors 3 and 4 requires minor adjustments to ensure optimal coverage.
- **Accessibility**: The facility meets accessibility requirements for individuals with disabilities, including a ramp leading to the main entrance and accessible pathways throughout the building.

### **5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**
1. **Electrical Systems**: 
   - **Issue**: Worn-out wiring connections in control panels on floors 5 and 7.
   - **Recommendation**: Replace the outdated wiring with modern, energy-efficient wiring systems to comply with current regulations.
   
2. **Plumbing Systems**:
   - **Issue**: Visible water stains on ceiling tiles around the service entrance.
   - **Recommendation**: Conduct a thorough inspection of the plumbing system to address any underlying issues and ensure compliance with water-tightness standards.

3. **HVAC System**:
   - **Issue**: Inefficient energy consumption patterns.
   - **Recommendation**: Modernize the HVAC system to improve energy efficiency, potentially through upgrading to high-efficiency equipment or implementing smart controls.

4. **Fire Safety Systems**:
   - **Issue**: Automatic sprinkler system on floors 3 and 4 requires minor adjustments for optimal coverage.
   - **Recommendation**: Adjust the sprinkler system settings to ensure full coverage and test the system's functionality during a simulated fire drill.

5. **Accessibility**:
   - **Issue**: No visible barriers or modifications that could improve accessibility.
   - **Recommendation**: Ensure all pathways are clearly marked for easy navigation, especially for individuals with mobility challenges.

### **6. Compliance Summary**
The inspection report indicates that the facility partially complies with current building regulations and standards. While no major safety violations were identified, there are areas where improvements can be made to ensure full compliance with modern building codes and energy efficiency requirements.

---

### **7. Conclusion**
The "Raahe Industrial Complex" is in good overall structural condition and meets basic compliance criteria. However, it requires minor updates to its electrical systems, plumbing, HVAC, and fire safety systems to fully comply with current regulations. The facility is suitable for continued industrial use but should undergo a full renovation or upgrade if sold as a commercial property.

**Recommendation**: Conduct a follow-up inspection within 12 months to assess any potential issues that have developed since the last inspection. If no significant changes are required, the building can be certified as compliant and safe for its intended use.
