### **5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**  
1. **Structural Concerns:**  
   - **Issue:** Visible warping in the wooden beams of the second floor due to age-related expansion/contraction.  
   - **Recommendation:** Replace the subfloor timbers (200x200mm) with thicker, more durable wood planks (250x200mm).  

2. **Electrical Systems:**  
   - **Issue:** Outdated 20-year-old circuit breaker panel and wiring Harness requiring modernization.  
   - **Recommendation:** Upgrade the electrical panel to a 2023-compliant model and replace any corroded wiring connections.  

3. **Plumbing Systems:**  
   - **Issue:** One of the drainage pipes is partially blocked due to years of debris accumulation.  
   - **Recommendation:** Schedule a professional plumber to clear the clog and ensure long-term water flow efficiency.  

4. **HVAC System:**  
   - **Issue:** The current HVAC system was designed for 2003 standards but lacks energy-efficient features.  
   - **Recommendation:** Replace the existing heating and cooling units with high-efficiency, smart home compatible models.  

5. **Fire Safety:**  
   - **Issue:** Two smoke detectors are outdated and no longer meet current Finnish fire safety regulations.  
   - **Recommendation:** Replace these detectors with modern, multi-sensor models that comply with 2023 standards.  

6. **Accessibility:**  
   - **Issue:** The existing staircase handrails are minimal and do not provide adequate support for elderly residents or individuals with mobility challenges.  
   - **Recommendation:** Upgrade the handrails to include additional support brackets and ensure they meet ergonomic standards.

The residential building in Lestij채rvi is in good overall condition, with no immediate safety risks. However, several components require updating to ensure long-term functionality and compliance with modern building codes.  

- **Next Steps:**  
   - Replace the subfloor timbers (200x200mm) with thicker wood planks (250x200mm).  
   - Upgrade the electrical panel and wiring Harness to 2023 standards.  
   - Clear the blocked drainage pipe and replace outdated smoke detectors.  
   - Replace the HVAC system with energy-efficient, smart home compatible models.  

- **Final Recommendation:** Conduct a full structural inspection within six months to ensure all modifications are properly integrated into the building's safety framework.
