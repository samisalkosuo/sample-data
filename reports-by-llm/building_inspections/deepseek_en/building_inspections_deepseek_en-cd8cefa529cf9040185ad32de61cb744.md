### 3. Inspection Context  
On the morning of 24 September 2024, a routine building inspection was conducted in Suonenjoki Municipality. The weather conditions were partly cloudy with a slight breeze, ideal for outdoor inspections. The purpose of this inspection was to evaluate the structural integrity and compliance with local building regulations for an industrial facility.

### 4. Observations and Findings  

#### Structural Integrity  
- The building appears structurally sound with no immediate signs of foundation instability or major frame issues. However, there are visible signs of corrosion on the steel beams supporting the upper floors.  

#### Electrical Systems  
- The electrical panel is operational but shows signs of wear and tear. Two of the circuit breakers need to be replaced to ensure safety and efficiency.  

#### Plumbing Systems  
- The plumbing system functions adequately, though there are visible stains on the pipes near the foundation, likely due to water infiltration during heavy rain events in recent years.  

#### HVAC Systems  
- The heating and cooling systems operate efficiently, with no significant issues observed during the inspection. However, the ductwork is outdated and requires modernization for better performance and energy efficiency.  

#### Fire Safety  
- The fire safety measures are adequate, including automatic fire detectors and tested smoke suppression systems. No visible breaches of these systems were found.  

#### Accessibility  
- The building has basic accessibility features, but there are minor issues with the main staircase, which is not compliant with current Finnish accessibility standards. A small ramp would improve usability for individuals with mobility challenges.

### 5. Identified Issues and Recommendations  

| **Issue**                                                                 | **Recommendation**                                                                 |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Visible corrosion on steel beams (2025 construction)                    | Replace the affected steel plates with modern, stainless steel components.          |
| Outdated electrical wiring that requires replacement                       | Upgrade the circuit breakers and rewires the entire system for efficiency.         |
| Visible pipe stains near the foundation                                  | Seal the pipes or replace them to prevent further water infiltration.              |
| Outdated HVAC ductwork                                                   | Modernize the ductwork with energy-efficient, insulated components.               |
| Minor non-compliant accessibility features                               | Install a small ramp at the main staircase for better usability.                   |

### 6. Compliance Summary  
The building complies with current Finnish construction codes and regulations in most areas, except for the outdated electrical wiring and HVAC systems. Modernization of these components is recommended to ensure long-term efficiency and safety.

---

### 7. Conclusion  
The industrial building in question has a good overall condition, with minor issues that do not compromise its structural integrity or safety. Routine maintenance and modernization of outdated systems are advised to ensure compliance with future regulations and improve operational efficiency.  

**Follow-up inspection is scheduled for 15 October 2024 to address the identified issues.**
