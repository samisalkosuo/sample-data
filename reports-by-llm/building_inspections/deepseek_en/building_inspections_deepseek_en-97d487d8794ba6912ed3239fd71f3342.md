### **3. Inspection Context**

The inspection was conducted at the request of the local real estate agent, who noted concerns regarding the building's structural integrity and potential safety risks. The weather conditions on 16 January 2025 were mild but cold, with snowfall expected during the day due to Finland's typical wintery climate.

### **4. Observations and Findings**

#### **Structural Integrity**  
- The building appears structurally sound overall, with no immediate signs of collapse or instability. However, some beams in the upper floors show signs of fatigue, likely due to prolonged occupancy over 50 years.  

#### **Electrical Systems**  
- The electrical panel is outdated and requires modernization to comply with current Finnish Building Codes. Several receptacles are overloaded, posing a risk of fire if overloaded further.  

#### **Plumbing Systems**  
- The plumbing system shows signs of wear and tear, particularly in the oldest section of the building. A water heater unit is overdue for maintenance and could compromise safety if not addressed promptly.  

#### **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC)**  
- The HVAC system operates efficiently but lacks energy efficiency ratings. Upgrading to a more modern, high-efficiency system is recommended to reduce energy consumption and costs in the long term.  

#### **Fire Safety**  
- Fire extinguishers are present but not properly maintained. The smoke detectors installed in 1985 are no longer functional due to age. Additional detectors should be installed throughout the building.  

#### **Accessibility**  
- The building has limited access for individuals with mobility challenges, particularly on the upper floors. Handrails and emergency exits require modernization to ensure compliance with Finnish accessibility standards.

|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Outdated electrical wiring and receptacles                                         | Replace or rewire the electrical panel and update receptacle sizes.                |
| Overloading of plumbing fixtures                                                | Service the old water heater and install a new, energy-efficient unit.           |
| Outdated HVAC system                                                        | Upgrade to a high-efficiency HVAC system.                                        |
| Non-functional smoke detectors                                               | Replace all smoke detectors with modern, functional units.                        |
| Limited access for persons with disabilities                                    | Modernize handrails and emergency exits in upper floors.                         |

### **6. Compliance Summary**

The building does not fully comply with the Finnish Building Code of 2023 due to outdated materials, systems, and infrastructure. Key areas requiring attention include electrical wiring, plumbing, HVAC efficiency, fire safety, and accessibility. Immediate action is required for several items to ensure long-term safety and compliance.

---

### **7. Conclusion**

The Valmari Business Park building, constructed in 1976, has aged gracefully but requires several updates to meet modern standards. The primary structural integrity remains intact, but significant improvements are needed to enhance safety, efficiency, and accessibility. Immediate action on the HVAC system, water heater upgrade, and smoke detector maintenance is recommended.
