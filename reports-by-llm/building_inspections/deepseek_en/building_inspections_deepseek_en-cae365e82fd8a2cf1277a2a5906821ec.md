### **4. Observations and Findings**  

#### **Structural Integrity**  
- The building appears structurally sound overall, with no immediate signs of collapse or instability. However, there are visible signs of age-related wear and tear on the exterior walls, particularly around the foundation and eaves.  

#### **Electrical Systems**  
- The electrical wiring is outdated and requires modernization to meet current safety standards. There are signs of moisture damage along the wiring, likely due to prolonged exposure to Lapland's cold climate.  

#### **Plumbing Systems**  
- The plumbing system appears functional but shows signs of wear on the pipes and fixtures. The water heater is operational but shows signs of inefficiency, requiring a minor upgrade for better performance.  

#### **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC)**  
- The HVAC system operates efficiently during the inspection period but shows signs of reduced efficiency over time. Additional insulation may be required to improve energy efficiency in line with modern building codes.  

#### **Fire Safety**  
- The fire safety measures are adequate for the current construction materials. However, there is a minor concern regarding the age of the smoke detectors and sprinkler system, which may need replacement or reinforcement to meet updated standards.  

#### **Accessibility**  
- The property has basic accessibility features but lacks modern amenities such as elevators in the principal building. Handrails on stairs are slightly worn out and require attention for safety compliance.
