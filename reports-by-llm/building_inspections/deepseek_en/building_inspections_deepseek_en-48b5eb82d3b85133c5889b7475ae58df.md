### **3. Inspection Context**  
The inspection was conducted on 01.01.2025 in Varkaus, Finland. The weather conditions were partly cloudy with light snowfall, which could impact the structural integrity of the building due to ice loads. The purpose of this inspection was to conduct a routine structural check to ensure compliance with current Finnish building regulations and to identify any potential issues that may require immediate attention.

### **4. Observations and Findings**  
- **Structural Integrity:**  
  - The wooden beams in the second floor were slightly warped due to moisture damage, likely caused by standing water near the foundation during heavy rainfall earlier in the year.  
  - The exterior paint on the clapboard walls was peeling in several areas, consistent with exposure to environmental factors over the past decade.  

- **Electrical System:**  
  - The wiring system in the kitchen and bathrooms appeared to be outdated, with several receptacles showing signs of excessive wear and tear.  
  - The electrical panel was overloaded, necessitating a circuit breaker upgrade during the inspection.  

- **Plumbing System:**  
  - A burst pipe was identified in the basement, likely caused by freezing temperatures over winter and subsequent water damage.  
  - The water heater was operating inefficiently due to poor insulation around its tank, leading to higher energy consumption.  

- **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC):**  
  - The HVAC system was functioning adequately but showed signs of wear and tear in the ductwork, particularly in the attic.  
  - The air filters were overdue for replacement, which could impact indoor air quality during colder months.  

- **Fire Safety:**  
  - The smoke detectors were functional but required a professional test to ensure they were within specification limits.  
  - Fire extinguishers were present and functional, but their condition needed to be reassessed in accordance with local regulations.  

- **Accessibility:**  
  - The driveway had a slight slope that made it difficult for a wheelchair to access the property consistently.  
  - The front door frame creaks slightly upon movement, potentially posing an unnecessary risk to residents who may have mobility challenges.

### **5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**  
1. **Structural Integrity:**  
   - **Issue:** Warped wooden beams in the second floor due to moisture damage.  
   - **Recommendation:** Replace the beams with structurally sound alternatives, ensuring compliance with Finnish building codes.  

2. **Electrical System:**  
   - **Issue:** Outdated wiring and overloaded electrical panel.  
   - **Recommendation:** Upgrade the wiring system and install a new circuit breaker panel to prevent future overloading issues.  

3. **Plumbing System:**  
   - **Issue:** Burst pipe in the basement due to freezing temperatures and water damage.  
   - **Recommendation:** Replace the burst pipe with a durable, weather-resistant pipe and install improved insulation around the water heater tank.  

4. **HVAC System:**  
   - **Issue:** Ductwork showing signs of wear and tear in the attic.  
   - **Recommendation:** Schedule professional maintenance or replacement of the HVAC system to ensure optimal performance and energy efficiency.  

5. **Fire Safety:**  
   - **Issue:** Smoke detectors requiring professional testing.  
   - **Recommendation:** Schedule a professional inspection of the smoke detectors to ensure they are functioning within specification limits.  

6. **Accessibility:**  
   - **Issue:** Sloped driveway and creaking front door frame.  
   - **Recommendation:** Level the driveway and reinforce the front door frame to improve accessibility for all residents, including those with mobility challenges.

### **6. Compliance Summary**  
The building appears to be in good compliance with Finnish building regulations as of 2025. However, due to its age (13 years), it is essential to perform routine maintenance and upgrades to ensure long-term structural integrity and safety. The identified issues are actionable and align with the recommendations provided by Finnish building authorities.  

---

### **7. Conclusion**  
The residential building in question has a good overall condition but requires attention to several critical areas, including structural reinforcement, electrical system upgrades, plumbing repairs, HVAC maintenance, fire safety improvements, and accessibility enhancements. Regular professional inspections should be scheduled to prevent deterioration and ensure compliance with current building codes.
