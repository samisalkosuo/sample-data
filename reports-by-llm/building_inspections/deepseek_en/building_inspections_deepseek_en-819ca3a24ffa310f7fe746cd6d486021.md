### **4. Observations and Findings**  

#### **Structural Integrity**  
- The building appears structurally sound, with no immediate signs of collapse or instability. However, there are signs of uneven settling in the foundation, which may be related to the age of the structure.  

#### **Electrical Systems**  
- The electrical wiring is outdated and requires modernization to meet current Finnish electrical standards. Several receptacles and lighting fixtures are non-compliant with current regulations.  

#### **Plumbing Systems**  
- The plumbing system shows signs of wear and tear, including peeling paint on the pipes and a tendency for water leaks at joints. A small section of the drainage system is clogged due to accumulated debris.  

#### **Heating and Cooling (HVAC) System**  
- The heating system appears functional but is inefficient, with subpar heating performance during colder months. The cooling system, if present, shows signs of wear and tear.  

#### **Fire Safety**  
- The fire extinguisher installed in the building is outdated and does not meet current Finnish fire safety standards. Additional fire suppression systems may be required for full compliance.  

#### **Accessibility**  
- The property has limited accessibility due to steep staircases and a narrow door frame, which could pose challenges for individuals with mobility impairments.

|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Outdated electrical wiring and fixtures                                         | Replace or modernize the electrical system to meet current Finnish standards.        |
| Peeling paint on plumbing pipes and clogged drainage system                  | Repair or replace the affected plumbing components and clear debris from the system. |
| Inefficient heating system                                                   | Upgrade the HVAC system for better energy efficiency and performance.             |
| Outdated fire extinguisher                                                  | Replace with a modern, compliant fire suppression system.                           |
| Limited accessibility due to steep stairs and narrow door frame            | Revise the staircase design or install widened doorways for improved accessibility. |
