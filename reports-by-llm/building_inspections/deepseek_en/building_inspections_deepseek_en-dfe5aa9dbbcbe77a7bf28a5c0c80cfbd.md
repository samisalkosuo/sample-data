### **4. Observations and Findings**  

#### **Structural Integrity**  
- The foundation appears intact, but there are minor signs of subsidence in the lower levels due to uneven ground settling during construction.  
- The structural beams (metal and reinforced concrete) are in good condition, with no visible cracks or deflections exceeding 1% of their span length.

#### **Electrical Systems**  
- The electrical panel is operational but requires modernization to comply with current Finnish electrical codes. Specifically, the circuit breakers need to be upgraded to higher amps (from 60A to 80A).  

#### **Plumbing Systems**  
- The plumbing system is functional and meets basic requirements. However, it is outdated and requires significant upgrades to meet modern efficiency standards, including water recycling systems.

#### **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC)**  
- The HVAC system operates efficiently but shows signs of wear and tear on the outdoor unit. Annual maintenance is recommended to ensure optimal performance.

#### **Fire Safety**  
- The fire extinguishers are functional and tested. The sprinkler system appears to be operational with no issues detected during inspection.

#### **Accessibility**  
- The building has basic accessibility features, but the steps leading to the first floor are uneven and do not meet ADA standards. A small ramp is recommended for easier access for individuals with mobility challenges.

### **5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**  

| **Issue**                          | **Details**                                                                 | **Recommendation**                                                                 |
|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------:|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| Electrical Panel Modernization       | Circuit breakers are 60A; need to upgrade to 80A.                           | Upgrade the electrical panel to meet current codes.                              |
| Plumbing System Upgrades           | Outdated pipes and fixtures; need modernization for efficiency and safety.| Replace outdated plumbing with energy-efficient systems.                        |
| HVAC System Maintenance             | Outdoor unit shows wear; annual tune-up needed.                            | Schedule professional HVAC maintenance.                                            |
| Fire Extinguisher Testing          | Tested within the last month.                                              | No immediate action required unless extinguishers are non-functional.            |
| Accessibility Issue                 | Uneven steps leading to first floor; small ramp needed.                     | Install a small ramp for better accessibility compliance.                       |

### **6. Compliance Summary**  
The building complies with local Finnish construction regulations but requires minor upgrades to fully meet current standards. No immediate safety concerns were identified during the inspection.

---

### **7. Conclusion**  
The industrial building in Turku, completed in 2019, is structurally sound and safe for use. Minor updates are recommended to ensure compliance with modern building codes and improve functionality. Follow-up inspections should be scheduled within six months to monitor any potential issues after the recommended upgrades.
