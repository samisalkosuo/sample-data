---

### **3. Inspection Context**

The inspection was conducted on 17 January 2025 during a cold and snowy weather condition in Lapland. The temperature reached -10°C, with light snowfall and ice formation on the roof. The purpose of the inspection was to ensure compliance with current Finnish building regulations while evaluating the structural integrity and functionality of the facility for potential resale or renovation purposes.

### **4. Observations and Findings**

#### **Structural Integrity**  
- The steel beams appear structurally sound, but there are signs of fatigue in the supporting columns due to repeated loading from machinery.  

#### **Electrical System**  
- The wiring system is outdated and requires modernization (e.g., upgrading to gfC or NBS认证).  

#### **Water and sewer System**  
- The roof insulation shows signs of water ingress, likely caused by a malfunctioning drainage system during the previous winter.  

#### **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC)**  
- The HVAC system is inefficient, with poor insulation in the ductwork leading to higher energy consumption.  

#### **Fire Safety**  
- The smoke detectors are outdated and do not meet current Finnish standards. Additional fire blankets and a modern smoke evacuation system are recommended.  

#### **Accessibility**  
- The facility has limited access for maintenance vehicles due to restricted doorways and narrow walkways, necessitating modifications for compliance with accessibility standards.
