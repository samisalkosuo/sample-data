---

### **3. Inspection Context**  
The inspection was conducted on a commercial building located in Lemland, Finland. The weather conditions were mild with high humidity due to the warm summer climate typical for this region. The purpose of the inspection was to ensure compliance with local building regulations and to assess the structural integrity and functionality of the property.

### **4. Observations and Findings**  

#### **Structural Integrity:**  
- The building appears structurally sound, with no visible signs of foundation settlement or major cracking in the shear walls. However, there are minor signs of moisture damage on the exterior wall at the first floor level due to condensation from high humidity.

#### **Electrical System:**  
- The electrical panel is outdated and requires modernization to comply with current Finnish building codes. The lighting fixtures are functional but require replacement for energy efficiency upgrades.

#### **Plumbing System:**  
- The plumbing system appears to be in good condition, with no visible leaks or clogs. However, the water pressure at the main supply valve shows signs of gradual reduction over time, which may indicate inefficiencies in the water distribution system.

#### **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC):**  
- The HVAC system is operational but requires annual maintenance to ensure optimal performance and energy efficiency. The ductwork has minor wear and tear, necessitating periodic inspection.

#### **Fire Safety:**  
- The fire extinguisher on the first floor is functional and properly maintained. The smoke detectors are operational, but additional units should be installed in areas with limited visibility or no smoke detection coverage.

#### **Accessibility:**  
- The building meets basic accessibility standards for its intended use (commercial). However, the main staircase has uneven treads that could pose a risk to older tenants or individuals with mobility challenges. A small step modification is recommended.
