---

### **3. Inspection Context**  
The inspection was conducted during a warm summer day (24 August 2024) with high humidity levels due to recent rain showers. The temperature reached approximately 35°C, and there was a noticeable risk of moisture buildup on exterior surfaces. The purpose of the inspection was to evaluate the structural integrity and compliance of the property as it pertains to its intended use for residential living.

### **4. Observations and Findings**  
- **Structural Integrity:** The building appears structurally sound, with no visible signs of major foundation issues or lateral loads exceeding design limits. However, minor warping in the exterior wood panels was observed due to temperature fluctuations during the summer months.  
- **Exterior:** The wooden exterior panels show light warping on the south-facing side, likely caused by differential expansion from heat exposure. The paint on the windows and doors is peeling slightly but remains intact.  
- **Interior:** The ceiling appears in good condition, with no visible cracks or leaks. The walls are free of major damage, though there is a small peephole installed above a window that requires attention for safety compliance.  
- **Electrical System:** The electrical panel and wiring were inspected, and they appear to be in satisfactory working order. All switches and outlets function as expected.  
- **Plumbing:** The plumbing system was functional during the inspection, but there is mildew growth on the showerhead due to accumulated moisture from rainwater infiltration.  
- **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC):** The HVAC system operates efficiently, with no significant issues observed during the inspection. However, it is noted that the system is several years old and may require periodic maintenance to ensure optimal performance.  
- **Fire Safety:** The fire extinguisher is functional, and the smoke detectors are operational. The building complies with local fire safety regulations regarding the placement of emergency exits and signage.

### **5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**  
1. **Exterior Wood Panels:** Minor warping on the south-facing side due to temperature changes.  
   - **Recommendation:** Apply a wood stabilizer or sealant to mitigate expansion cracks and ensure long-term durability.  
2. **Peeling Paint:** Light peeling on windows and doors, which does not impede occupancy but could be addressed for aesthetics.  
   - **Recommendation:** Re-paint the exterior surfaces using high-quality, weather-resistant paint.  
3. **Peephole:** The small peephole installed above a window is non-compliant with Finnish building regulations regarding safety.  
   - **Recommendation:** Replace or remove the peephole to ensure compliance and enhance safety standards.  
4. **Water Heater:** The water heater is several years old, and its efficiency could be improved.  
   - **Recommendation:** Consider upgrading the water heater to a more energy-efficient model to reduce utility costs and improve performance.  
5. **HVAC System:** While functional, the HVAC system is outdated and requires periodic maintenance.  
   - **Recommendation:** Schedule routine maintenance or upgrade the HVAC system to ensure optimal comfort and efficiency.

### **6. Compliance Summary**  
The building complies with Finnish national building regulations for residential properties constructed in 2010. However, it does not meet modern standards for energy efficiency, safety, and durability due to its age and outdated systems. The identified issues are actionable and should be addressed promptly to ensure the property remains safe and functional.  

---

### **7. Conclusion**  
The inspected residential building in Kihniö, Finland, is structurally sound and meets basic compliance requirements for its intended use. However, it requires minor repairs to address peeling paint, warping wood panels, and outdated systems such as the HVAC unit and water heater. The property owner is encouraged to implement the recommended fixes to enhance the building's safety, comfort, and energy efficiency. Follow-up inspections should be conducted within six months after addressing the identified issues to ensure compliance with updated building codes and standards.
