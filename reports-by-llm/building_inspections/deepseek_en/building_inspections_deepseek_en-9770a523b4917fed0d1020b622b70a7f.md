### **3. Inspection Context**  
On the morning of the inspection (June 1st, 2025), the weather conditions were mild but humid due to the ongoing growing season in southern Finland. The inspector conducted a comprehensive visual and structural assessment of the facility as part of a routine building check to ensure compliance with current local regulations.  

---

### **4. Observations and Findings**  
The inspection revealed several issues that required attention:  

1. **Structural Concerns:**  
   - The foundation exhibited signs of settling, which could compromise long-term structural integrity if not addressed promptly.  
   - The building frame showed signs of corrosion on the exterior walls, particularly around the windows and doors.  

2. **Electrical Systems:**  
   - The wiring was outdated and required modernization to meet current safety standards. Multiple receptacles were non-compliant with the latest European electrical codes.  

3. **Plumbing Systems:**  
   - The water heater system was inefficient and could lead to increased energy consumption. A new high-efficiency model is recommended for optimal performance.  

4. **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC):**  
   - The HVAC system was several years past its service life and required significant upgrades to ensure proper functionality and energy efficiency.  

5. **Fire Safety:**  
   - The fire extinguisher system was outdated, and the emergency exit signs were non-compliant with current Finnish standards. Additional inspections are recommended to ensure compliance.  

6. **Accessibility:**  
   - The front door had a threshold height that made it difficult for individuals with mobility challenges to enter or exit the building. A new entryway is required to meet accessibility standards.  

---

### **5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**  
Based on the findings, the following actionable recommendations are proposed:  

1. **Foundation Settlement:**  
   - Conduct a professional survey to determine the extent of foundation settling and implement stabilisation measures such as pile driving or underpinning.  

2. **Electrical Systems Upgrades:**  
   - Replace all outdated wiring with modern, compliant systems that meet current European electrical codes.  

3. **Water Heater Upgrade:**  
   - Install a high-efficiency water heater to reduce energy consumption and operational costs.  

4. **HVAC System Upgradation:**  
   - Replace the existing HVAC system with a new, energy-efficient model to improve performance and reduce utility bills.  

5. **Fire Safety Enhancements:**  
   - Update the fire extinguisher system and ensure all emergency exit signs are compliant with Finnish standards.  

6. **Accessibility Improvements:**  
   - Modify the front door to meet accessibility requirements, including adjustable height options or a new entryway.  

---

### **6. Compliance Summary**  
The inspection revealed that the building does not fully comply with current local and national building regulations. Key areas requiring improvement include structural stability, electrical systems, water heater efficiency, HVAC performance, fire safety, and accessibility. Immediate action is required to address these gaps and ensure compliance before the building is considered safe for occupancy or resale.  

---

### **7. Conclusion**  
The industrial facility in Mänttä-Vilppula, Finland, is in satisfactory overall condition but requires several critical upgrades to meet modern safety standards and operational efficiency. Immediate attention should be directed to the electrical system, water heater, HVAC, fire safety measures, and accessibility improvements. Follow-up inspections are recommended within six months to assess the effectiveness of the proposed fixes.
