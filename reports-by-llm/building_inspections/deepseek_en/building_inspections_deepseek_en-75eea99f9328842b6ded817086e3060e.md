**4. Observations and Findings**  

- **Structural Integrity**:  
  - The building appears structurally sound with no visible signs of damage or uplift. However, the foundation was found to be slightly uneven in certain areas, which may impact long-term stability if not addressed.  

- **Electrical Systems**:  
  - The electrical panel is outdated and requires modernization to comply with current Finnish electrical codes. Several receptacles are non-compliant with the latest standards.  

- **Plumbing Systems**:  
  - The plumbing system shows signs of mildew growth on pipes near the foundation, indicating potential water infiltration issues.  

- **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC)**:  
  - The HVAC units function adequately but are prone to condensation buildup in damp conditions. A small leak was detected in one of the air ducts.  

- **Fire Safety**:  
  - The fire extinguisher is functional, but the smoke detectors within the office areas are outdated and require replacement.  

- **Accessibility**:  
  - The elevator from 2015 is operational but requires modernization to improve accessibility for individuals with mobility challenges. The staircase steps are uneven, posing a risk of tripping in poorly lit areas.
