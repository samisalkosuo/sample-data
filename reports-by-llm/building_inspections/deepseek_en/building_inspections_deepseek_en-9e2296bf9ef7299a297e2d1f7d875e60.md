### **2. Building Overview**  
- **Building Type:** Commercial (Office/Industrial)  
- **Construction Year:** 2001  
- **Number of Floors:** 7  
- **Primary Materials:** Brick and concrete with metal accents (typical for pre-fabricated commercial buildings in Finland during the early 2000s).  

---

### **3. Inspection Context**  
The inspection was conducted on 01.08.2024, a hot and humid summer day typical for Hanko's climate. The building was inspected as part of routine maintenance checks to ensure compliance with local building regulations.  

---

### **4. Observations and Findings**  

#### **Structural Integrity**  
- The building appears structurally sound, with no visible signs of major foundation issues or lateral load failures. However, the brickwork shows signs of expansion joints due to thermal cycling over the years.

#### **Electrical System**  
- The electrical panel is 20 years old and requires modernization to meet current Finnish electrical codes. The circuit breakers are outdated and need to be replaced with higher-current-rated devices.

#### **Plumbing System**  
- The plumbing system appears functional, but there are signs of mildew growth on the pipes due to poor insulation in the walls. This could lead to health risks if not addressed promptly.

#### **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC)**  
- The HVAC system is operational but shows signs of wear and tear. The refrigerant levels are low, necessitating a service call for recharge. The ductwork has minor cracks that may compromise air quality.

#### **Fire Safety**  
- The fire extinguisher system is functional and in working order. Fire doors are intact and meet the required dimensions. No visible smoke detectors or alarms were observed during the inspection.

#### **Accessibility**  
- The building has standard doorways, but there are no elevator accommodations for individuals with mobility challenges. Handrails on stairs are present but could be improved for better safety.

### **6. Compliance Summary**  
The building generally complies with Finnish building regulations, but a few areas require attention as outlined above. The current state of the building is deemed safe for occupancy, provided the recommended actions are taken promptly.

---

### **7. Conclusion**  
The commercial building in Hanko, constructed in 2001, has been assessed to be structurally sound and compliant with most local regulations. However, several minor issues require attention to ensure long-term functionality and safety. Immediate action is recommended for the electrical panel and insulation upgrades. Follow-up inspections will be conducted within six months to verify any improvements.
