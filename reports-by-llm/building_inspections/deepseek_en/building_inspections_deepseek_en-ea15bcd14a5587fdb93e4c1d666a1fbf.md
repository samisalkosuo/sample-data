### **2. Building Overview**  
- **Building Type:** Commercial (office/warehouse)  
- **Construction Year:** 1995  
- **Number of Floors:** 5  
- **Primary Materials:** Brick and concrete with insulation (EPS foam) for energy efficiency.  
- **Structure:** Reinforced brick walls, concrete floors, and metal roof structure.  

---

### **3. Inspection Context**  
The inspection was conducted on a partly cloudy day in Lapland, with temperatures hovering around -5°C due to the cold northern climate. The building underwent a routine structural check as part of its annual maintenance to ensure compliance with local building regulations.

### **4. Observations and Findings**  

#### **Structural Integrity**  
- The building appears structurally sound, with no immediate signs of sagging beams or excessive wear on the foundation. However, there are minor signs of settlement in the outer walls due to differential heating during construction.  

#### **Electrical Systems**  
- The electrical panel is outdated and requires modernization to comply with current Finnish electrical codes. There are no visible live wires exposed, but the wiring system shows signs of corrosion in several joints.  

#### **Plumbing Systems**  
- The plumbing appears functional, with no visible leaks or clogs. However, the water pipes are made of older PEX material and require upgrading for long-term sustainability.  

#### **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC)**  
- The HVAC system is operational but shows signs of inefficiency due to outdated ductwork and lack of insulation around air ducts.  

#### **Fire Safety**  
- The fire extinguisher on the ground floor is functional but outdated in design. The sprinkler system appears to be in good working order, with no visible water suppression systems installed.  

#### **Accessibility**  
- The building has basic accessibility features, including a ramp at the entrance and grab bars in the bathrooms. However, the outer staircase lacks handrails for elderly residents or individuals with mobility challenges.

### **5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**  

| **Issue**                     | **Details**                                                                 | **Recommendation**                                                                 |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------:|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| Sagging Outer Walls          | Minor settlement in outer walls due to differential heating.                | Reinforce the exterior structural framework using steel beams or additional foundation slabs. |
| Outdated Electrical Panel     | Current electrical wiring and panel are 15 years old, exceeding regulations.| Replace with a modern, energy-efficient electrical system.                        |
| PEX Pipes                    | Older PEX pipes in plumbing systems require replacement for sustainability.   | Replace all PEX pipes with CPVC or PVC-U equivalents.                              |
| Inefficient HVAC System       | Ductwork and insulation are outdated; requires modernization.                | Upgrade HVAC system to improve efficiency and reduce energy consumption.             |
| Outdated Fire Extinguisher    | Fire extinguisher is 15 years old, exceeding Finnish fire codes.           | Replace with a modern, high-pressure extinguisher compliant with current regulations.   |
| No Handrails for Outer Staircase | Lacks handrails on outer staircase for safety.                              | Install handrails and ensure compliance with accessibility standards.               |

### **6. Compliance Summary**  
The building partially complies with Finnish building regulations but requires updates to fully meet modern standards, particularly in energy efficiency (HVAC, plumbing) and fire safety (extinguisher system). The structural integrity is maintained, but outdated materials necessitate timely replacements.

---

### **7. Conclusion**  
The commercial building in Kruunupyy, Finland, is structurally sound and functional for its intended use. However, it requires updates to its electrical systems, HVAC, plumbing, fire safety, and accessibility features to ensure compliance with current regulations and improve long-term sustainability.  

- **Overall Condition:** Well-maintained but needs routine updates.  
- **Follow-Up Recommendation:** Conduct a full renovation or upgrade in the next 5 years to address identified issues comprehensively.
