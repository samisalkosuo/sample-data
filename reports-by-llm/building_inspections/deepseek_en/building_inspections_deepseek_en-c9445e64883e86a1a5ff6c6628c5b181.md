- **Number of Floors:** 7  
- **Primary Materials:** Steel and concrete with reinforced cementitious composite (RCC) beams and columns, glass façade panels, and metal roofing.  

---

### **3. Inspection Context**  
The inspection was conducted on August 16, 2024, during a mild summer day in Alavieska, Finland. The temperature reached approximately 25°C with moderate humidity due to the ongoing monsoon season. The purpose of this inspection was to ensure compliance with current Finnish building codes and to assess the overall structural integrity and safety of the facility for its intended use as an industrial site.

### **4. Observations and Findings**  

#### **Structural Integrity**  
- The building appears structurally sound, with no visible signs of foundation settlement or lateral deflection under normal loading conditions.  
- The steel beams and columns exhibit consistent material distribution, free from cracks or delamination in the RCC structure.  

#### **Electrical Systems**  
- The electrical panel is operational but shows signs of wear on the circuit breakers. Two of the 120V circuits are slightly overloaded due to outdated wiring and subpanels.  

#### **Plumbing Systems**  
- The water supply system functions correctly, with all valves and fittings in good condition. However, the drainage pipes near the foundation exhibit localized corrosion, which may compromise long-term structural integrity if not addressed.  

#### **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC)**  
- The HVAC system operates efficiently, with no signs of leaks or malfunctions. The ductwork is free from blockages but shows minor wear on the insulation panels in the attic.  

#### **Fire Safety**  
- The fire extinguisher system is functional and maintained by a dedicated facility manager. Fire alarm systems are operational, but the smoke detectors within the industrial zones require periodic calibration due to age.  

#### **Accessibility**  
- The facility meets accessibility standards for manual operation of heavy machinery. However, the main entrance lacks an emergency exit sign, which could be a potential hazard in case of emergencies.

### **5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**  

| **Issue**                                                                 | **Recommendation**                                                                 |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Outdated wiring in electrical panels                                         | Replace or upgrade the circuit breakers to meet modern standards.                  |
| Corrosion on drainage pipes near the foundation                           | Replace the affected pipes with high-quality stainless steel equivalents.           |
| Minor wear and tear on insulation panels in the attic                      | Re-insulate the attic walls for improved thermal efficiency.                     |
| Lack of emergency exit sign at the main entrance                            | Install a visible emergency exit sign in compliance with accessibility standards.  |

### **6. Compliance Summary**  
The building complies with Finnish national building regulations and local municipality standards. Minor issues, such as outdated wiring and insulation wear, are within acceptable limits for an older industrial structure. No significant non-compliance was observed during the inspection.  

---

### **7. Conclusion**  
The inspected facility is in good overall condition, meeting modern safety and accessibility standards with minor adjustments required to address outdated components. A follow-up inspection is recommended if any of the identified issues are addressed or if further deterioration occurs.
