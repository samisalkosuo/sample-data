### **3. Inspection Context**  
The inspection was conducted on 05 May 2025 in Tampere, Finland. The weather conditions were mild to moderate, with occasional rain and humidity typical for spring or early summer months. The purpose of the inspection was a routine structural evaluation of an industrial building intended for resale.

### **4. Observations and Findings**  

#### **Structural Integrity:**  
- The steel beams exhibit visible wear and tear consistent with their age (1994 construction).  
- The concrete foundation shows minor cracking at the edges, likely due to uneven settling over the years.  

#### **Electrical System:**  
- The wiring system is outdated, with several junction boxes exceeding their original capacity.  
- There are signs of moisture damage on the electrical panels, indicating potential water ingress issues.  

#### **Plumbing System:**  
- The pipes show light corrosion in areas not exposed to external elements, typical for a 1994 installation.  
- A minor water leak was detected near the foundation, likely from an outdated pipe connection.  

#### **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC):**  
- The HVAC system is operational but shows signs of inefficiency, with higher energy consumption than recommended for the building size.  
- The ductwork has visible rust on the pipes, indicating potential for further corrosion if not addressed.  

#### **Fire Safety:**  
- The fire extinguisher is functional and in good condition.  
- The sprinkler system was tested during the inspection and functions properly, with no signs of damage to the pipes or sensors.  

#### **Accessibility:**  
- The building has a single staircase leading to the first floor, which is narrow and difficult for individuals with mobility challenges.  
- The overall accessibility standards are minimally met due to the age of the construction.

### **5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**  

| **Issue**                     | **Recommendation**                                                                 |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Visible wear on steel beams     | Replace or reinforce the affected beams to prevent further structural damage.        |
| Outdated wiring system         | Upgrade the electrical infrastructure, including replacing overloaded junction boxes.  |
| Minor water leak in pipes       | Seal or replace the affected pipe connection to prevent further leaks.              |
| Inefficient HVAC system         | Modernize the HVAC system to improve energy efficiency and performance.            |
| Fire extinguisher functionality | Ensure the fire extinguisher is regularly maintained and tested.                 |
| Narrow staircase              | Replace the narrow staircase with a wider, more accessible one or modify the layout.  |

### **6. Compliance Summary**  
The building complies with current Finnish construction codes in most areas: structural integrity, fire safety, and sprinkler system functionality are within acceptable limits. However, several components require retrofitting to meet updated building standards. Specifically, the electrical system, HVAC efficiency, and accessibility features need improvement to align with modern regulations.

---

### **7. Conclusion**  
The inspected industrial building from 1994 shows moderate wear and tear but remains structurally sound. Minor issues have been identified and actionable recommendations are provided for improvement. The overall condition is satisfactory, but regular maintenance and retrofitting of outdated systems are advised to ensure long-term compliance with building codes.
