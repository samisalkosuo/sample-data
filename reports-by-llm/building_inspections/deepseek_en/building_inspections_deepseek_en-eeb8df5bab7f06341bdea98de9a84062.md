### **4. Observations and Findings**

#### **Structural Integrity**
- The building appears structurally sound overall but shows signs of wear consistent with its age (1990).  
  - **Issue:** Outdated construction materials, including beams and joists, which may not meet modern load-bearing standards.

#### **Electrical System**
- The electrical system is functional but outdated.  
  - **Issue:** Low voltage in certain areas due to insufficient wiring capacity for modern appliances.

#### **Plumbing System**
- The plumbing system shows signs of wear and tear.  
  - **Issue:** Older pipes with degraded insulation, requiring replacement or upgrading.

#### **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC)**
- The HVAC system is operational but inefficient.  
  - **Issue:** Outdated equipment that requires modernization to meet energy efficiency standards.

#### **Fire Safety**
- Fire safety measures are adequate for the building's age.  
  - **Issue:** No visible smoke detectors or automatic fire extinguishers in all living areas.

#### **Accessibility**
- The property has basic accessibility features but lacks modern accommodations.  
  - **Issue:** Steps leading to the house make it difficult for individuals with mobility challenges, necessitating ramps.

### **6. Compliance Summary**
The inspection identified several issues that do not fully comply with current Finnish building regulations, particularly regarding structural integrity, electrical systems, and HVAC efficiency. Immediate attention is required to address these gaps before the property could be considered safe for resale or further use.

---

### **7. Conclusion**
The residential property in question has good overall structural integrity but requires immediate upgrades to meet modern standards. Annual maintenance should focus on replacing outdated components and upgrading systems to ensure long-term safety and compliance with Finnish building codes. Follow-up inspections are recommended within six months to monitor progress and prevent further deterioration.
