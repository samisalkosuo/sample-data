### **4. Observations and Findings**  
- **Structural Integrity:** The building appears structurally sound overall but shows signs of wear and tear consistent with its age (20 years). The foundation beams are slightly uneven, and the roof trusses show signs of fatigue from repeated exposure to Lapland's climate.  
- **Electrical Systems:** The electrical panel is outdated and requires modernization to meet current Finnish building regulations. The lighting fixtures are inefficient and require replacement.  
- **Plumbing Systems:** The plumbing system shows signs of age, with visible rust on the pipes and weak connections. There have been reports of water leaks in the upper floors due to freezing temperatures during winter months.  
- **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC):** The HVAC system is inefficient and requires significant upgrades. The ductwork is outdated, and there are frequent complaints about cold indoor air quality.  
- **Fire Safety:** The fire extinguisher system is functional but outdated in design. The sprinkler system was last inspected in 2015 and may require modernization to comply with current regulations.  
- **Accessibility:** The building has basic accessibility features, including a ramp for wheelchairs, but the staircase is narrow and uneven, posing challenges for individuals with mobility limitations.
