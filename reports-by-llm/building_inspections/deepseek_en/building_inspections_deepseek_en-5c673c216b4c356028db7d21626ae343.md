### **3. Inspection Context**

On the morning of the inspection (09:00 AM local time), the weather conditions were mild, with partly cloudy skies and temperatures ranging between 10°C and 20°C. The inspector conducted the examination at the building's main entrance, which is accessible via a wide, well-maintained pathway.

The purpose of this inspection was to evaluate the structural integrity, compliance with current building codes, and overall safety of the facility for potential resale or further industrial use.

### **4. Observations and Findings**

- **Structural Integrity:**  
  The building appears structurally sound, but there are signs of wear on the wooden beams, particularly in the upper floors. Some panels show minor discoloration consistent with age-related decay.

- **Electrical System:**  
  The electrical panel is outdated and requires modernization to meet current Finnish standards. There are no significant short circuits or power outages during the inspection.

- **Plumbing System:**  
  The plumbing system appears functional, but there are signs of mildew growth on the pipes in one of the service rooms. This may indicate inadequate ventilation or moisture control measures.

- **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC):**  
  The HVAC system is operational and provides adequate temperature regulation. However, it is noted that the system could be more energy-efficient with modern technologies.

- **Fire Safety:**  
  The fire safety equipment, including smoke detectors and exit signs, are functional. Fire extinguishers are present in designated areas, but they are not maintained up to standard.

- **Accessibility:**  
  The building has a ramp for wheelchair access, which is adequate. All emergency exits are clearly marked and functional.

### **5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

| **Issue**                     | **Recommendation**                                                                 |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Wooden beams show signs of decay | Schedule structural examination of beams to ensure compliance with current codes.     |
| Outdated electrical wiring       | Upgrade the electrical panel to meet modern standards.                               |
| Mildew growth on pipes          | Improve ventilation and moisture control in service areas.                          |
| Outdated fire safety measures   | Replace outdated smoke detectors and ensure all extinguishers are maintained.        |

---

### **6. Compliance Summary**

The building partially complies with current Finnish building regulations. While it meets basic structural and operational standards, several areas require improvement to fully comply with modern codes.

- **Structural Integrity:** Partial compliance due to minor decay in beams.
- **Electrical System:** Non-compliance due to outdated wiring.
- **Plumbing System:** Partial compliance with current moisture control practices.
- **Fire Safety:** Limited compliance due to outdated equipment.

---

### **7. Conclusion**

The industrial building is in good overall condition, suitable for routine operations or potential resale. However, it requires attention to modernize electrical systems and improve fire safety measures. A follow-up inspection is recommended within 6 months to ensure all issues are addressed.
