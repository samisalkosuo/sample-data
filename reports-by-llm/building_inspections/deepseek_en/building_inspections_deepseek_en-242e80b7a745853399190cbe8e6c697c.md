### **4. Observations and Findings**  

#### **Structural Integrity**  
- The building appears structurally sound, with no visible signs of foundation settlement or major frame issues. However, there are signs of moisture damage on the exterior clapboard panels in areas near the foundation.

#### **Plumbing System**  
- The plumbing system shows signs of age-related wear, including cracked pipes in the kitchen and bathroom. The water heater is older than the construction year and requires modernization to meet current efficiency standards.  

#### **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC)**

#### **Fire Safety**  
- The fire extinguisher is functional, but the sprinkler system was last inspected in 2019. Updates are recommended to ensure compliance with current regulations.  

#### **Accessibility**
