### **4. Observations and Findings**  
- **Structural Integrity:** The building appears structurally sound with no immediate signs of collapse. However, there are visible signs of wear on the steel beams (e.g., rust spots and minor corrosion).  
- **Electrical Systems:** The electrical panel is operational but outdated; rewiring is recommended to comply with current Finnish standards.  
- **Plumbing Systems:** The plumbing system functions adequately, but some pipes show signs of pitting due to age. A partial replacement is recommended for longevity.  
- **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC):** The HVAC system operates efficiently during the inspection period but shows signs of inefficiency in colder months. Upgrades may be necessary to improve energy efficiency.  
- **Fire Safety:** Fire extinguishers are functional, but the fire exit door has minor dents that could pose a hazard if not addressed.  
- **Accessibility:** The building has basic accessibility features (e.g., a single staircase), but the main entrance doors require attention for ease of use by individuals with mobility challenges.
