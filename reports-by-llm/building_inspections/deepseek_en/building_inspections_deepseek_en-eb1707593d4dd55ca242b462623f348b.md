### **4. Observations and Findings**  

#### **Structural Integrity**  
- The foundation was found to be structurally sound but showed signs of settlement due to differential ground warming over the years.  
- The steel beams were in good condition, with no visible cracks or corrosion.  

#### **Electrical System**  
- The electrical panel is outdated and requires modernization (e.g., upgrading to a smart grid system).  
- The lighting fixtures are functional but lack energy efficiency upgrades.  

#### **Plumbing System**  
- The plumbing system appears to be operational, but there are signs of water leakage at the baseboards in one of the service rooms.  
- The drainage system is functioning adequately, with no visible leaks or clogs.  

#### **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC)**  
- The HVAC system operates efficiently during inspections but shows signs of wear and tear on the outdoor unit components.  
- The ductwork is in good condition, with no visible damage to the insulation.  

#### **Fire Safety**  
- The fire safety systems are functional and meet current Finnish standards.  
- A small crack was observed in one of the wall studs, which could potentially compromise load-bearing integrity if not addressed.  

#### **Accessibility**  
- The building has basic accessibility features but lacks sufficient lighting in service areas (e.g., workshops).  
- The front entrance door is functional but requires modernization to meet current accessibility standards for individuals with mobility challenges.

### **5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**  
1. **Structural Concerns:**  
   - Foundation settlement requiring partial reinforcement or settlement basin installation.  
   - Upgrading the electrical panel to a modern, energy-efficient system.  

2. **Plumbing Concerns:**  
   - Addressing water leakage at the baseboards in the service room (e.g., replacing old pipes with PEX or PVC).  

3. **Fire Safety Concerns:**  
   - Repairing the small wall stud crack to prevent potential structural failure.  

4. **Accessibility Concerns:**  
   - Upgrading lighting in service areas to meet accessibility standards.  
   - Modernizing front entrance door to include a raised threshold and better accessibility features.  

---

### **6. Compliance Summary**  
The building complies with current Finnish building regulations for the majority of its systems (e.g., electrical, plumbing, HVAC). However, it is not fully compliant due to outdated systems and structural upgrades required to meet modern standards.

---

### **7. Conclusion**  
The industrial building in Savitaipale, constructed in 2006, has a good overall condition with no immediate safety risks. The primary areas requiring attention are the electrical system, plumbing, fire safety, and accessibility features. A follow-up inspection is recommended to address the identified issues and ensure compliance with updated building codes.
