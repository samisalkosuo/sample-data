### **5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

| **Issue**                     | **Details**                                                                 | **Recommendation**                                                                 |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Insulation Age**             | Insulation was last replaced in 2018; current performance is borderline acceptable.   | Replace insulation with a more energy-efficient material (e.g., cellulose) to reduce heat loss. |
| **Water Supply Minor Issue**    | Mildew growth on internal walls near the bathroom due to poor ventilation.     | Install additional ventilation fans in bathrooms and ensure proper sealing of windows.|
| **Appliances Age**              | Circuit breakers are outdated; they should be replaced with modern, energy-efficient models.  | Replace all outdated circuit breakers with recessed, gfcb-compliant units.         |
| **HVAC Outdoor Components**    | Moderate wear on outdoor HVAC components; regular maintenance is recommended.      | Schedule professional inspection and replacement of any worn-out outdoor components.|
| **Fire Extinguisher Placement** | Fire extinguisher placement in the kitchen is suboptimal for rapid access during emergencies.| Reposition the fire extinguisher to a more accessible location (e.g., near the staircase).|
