### **1. General Information**  
- **Country:** Finland  
- **Municipality:** Iitti  
- **Address:** [Inferred Address]  
- **Inspection Date:** 03.02.2025 (DD.MM.YYYY)  
- **Inspector Name:** Emma Svensson  

---

### **2. Building Overview**  
- **Building Type:** Industrial (e.g., warehouse, factory)  
- **Construction Year:** 2024  
- **Number of Floors:** 4  
- **Primary Materials:** Steel frame with concrete foundations and reinforced steel panels (common in modern industrial buildings for durability and safety).  

---

### **3. Inspection Context**  
The inspection was conducted on 03.02.2025, a partly cloudy day with light snow or sleet expected at the time of the report. The temperature was mild but below freezing, which could impact insulation performance. The purpose of this inspection was to conduct a routine structural check to ensure compliance with local building codes and safety standards.

### **4. Observations and Findings**  
- **Structural Integrity:**  
  - The steel frame appears structurally sound, with no signs of bowing or excessive deflection. However, the beams in the second floor exhibit minor wear consistent with their age (2024 construction).  
  - The concrete foundations show minimal settlement, within acceptable limits for a building of this type and age.  

- **Electrical Systems:**  
  - The electrical panel is operational but shows signs of moderate wear on the circuit breakers and wiring connections. Modernized circuit breakers are recommended for future upgrades.  

- **Plumbing Systems:**  
  - The plumbing system functions correctly, with all pipes in good condition. Minor leaks were observed in the service lines, likely due to aging PEX piping.  

- **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC):**  
  - The HVAC system operates efficiently but shows signs of moderate inefficiency. A heat exchanger filter is needed for optimal performance.  

- **Fire Safety:**  
  - Fire extinguishers are present and functional. The fire blankets in the storage area show minor wear but remain usable.  

- **Accessibility:**  
  - The building has standard doorways, but the front entrance lacks a utility bench or step stool, which could pose accessibility issues for individuals with mobility challenges.

### **5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**  
1. **Structural Concerns:**  
   - **Issue:** Moderate wear on beams in the second floor (2024 construction).  
   - **Recommendation:** Periodic inspections of structural components to ensure long-term stability.  

2. **Electrical Systems:**  
   - **Issue:** Circuit breakers and wiring connections show signs of moderate wear.  
   - **Recommendation:** Replace outdated circuit breakers with modernized, energy-efficient models.  

3. **Plumbing Systems:**  
   - **Issue:** PEX piping in service lines requires replacement or upgrading.  
   - **Recommendation:** Replace aging PEX pipes to improve long-term reliability and reduce water loss.  

4. **HVAC System:**  
   - **Issue:** Moderate inefficiency due to an outdated heat exchanger filter.  
   - **Recommendation:** Replace the filter with a modernized one for improved energy efficiency.  

5. **Fire Safety:**  
   - **Issue:** No mention of fire extinguishers being tested or maintained recently.  
   - **Recommendation:** Conduct a fire safety audit to ensure all systems are compliant and functioning properly.  

6. **Accessibility:**  
   - **Issue:** Lack of utility bench at the front entrance.  
   - **Recommendation:** Install a utility bench or step stool for enhanced accessibility.

### **6. Compliance Summary**  
The building partially complies with current Finnish building codes but requires updates to fully meet modern standards. Key areas needing attention include electrical systems, plumbing, HVAC efficiency, and accessibility features.  

---

### **7. Conclusion**  
The industrial building in question is structurally sound and functional overall. However, it requires minor upgrades to its electrical, plumbing, HVAC, and accessibility systems to ensure full compliance with Finnish building regulations. A follow-up inspection in 2026 will be conducted to assess the effectiveness of any recommended changes.
