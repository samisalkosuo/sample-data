### 4. Observations and Findings  

#### Structural Integrity  
- The building appears structurally sound with no immediate signs of foundation collapse or major frame issues. However, there are signs of wear and tear consistent with its age (20 years since construction).  

#### Electrical Systems  
- The electrical wiring is outdated but functional. There are minor issues with lighting fixtures, such as flickering bulbs, which could be addressed by upgrading the electrical components.  

#### Plumbing Systems  
- The plumbing system shows signs of aging pipes and grout lines. There are occasional clogs in the water supply, likely due to mineral buildup over time. A full inspection of the plumbing system is recommended.  

#### HVAC Systems  
- The heating and cooling systems function adequately but are inefficient compared to modern standards. Upgrading these systems would improve energy consumption and comfort.  

#### Fire Safety  
- The fire extinguishers are functional but outdated in design. Modern automatic systems should be installed to meet current safety regulations.  

#### Accessibility  
- The building has basic accessibility features, including a single staircase with handrails on the first floor. However, there is no elevator or ramp system for easier access for individuals with mobility challenges.
