### **4. Observations and Findings**

#### **Structural Integrity**  
- The building appears structurally sound, with no visible signs of foundation settlement or major frame issues. However, there are minor signs of wear and tear on the outer facade, consistent with its age (2025 - 1991 = 34 years).  

#### **Electrical Systems**  
- The electrical panel is outdated but functional. There are visible cracks in the wiring that could potentially pose a risk if not addressed promptly.  

#### **Plumbing Systems**  
- The plumbing system appears to be in good working condition. However, there are signs of mildew growth on the pipes and grout due to moisture accumulation over time.  

#### **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC)**  
- The HVAC system is operational but shows signs of inefficiency. The ductwork has visible dirt buildup, which may indicate a need for regular maintenance.  

#### **Fire Safety**  
- Fire extinguishers are present and functional. The fire exit sign is intact, and the emergency exit door is operational.  

#### **Accessibility**  
- The building is accessible to all individuals, including those with mobility challenges. However, there are minor steps at the entrance that could be improved for ease of access.

### **5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

1. **Structural Concerns:**  
   - Minor signs of wear on the outer facade (consistent with age).  
   - Suggested Action: Periodic structural inspections to ensure long-term stability.  

2. **Electrical Systems:**  
   - Cracks in wiring that could lead to electrical faults if not addressed.

4. **HVAC System:**  
   - Inefficient operation with visible dirt buildup in ductwork.  
   - Suggested Action: Replace the HVAC system with a more energy-efficient model and clean the ductwork.  

5. **Fire Safety:**  
   - Fire extinguishers are functional but could be tested for reliability.  
   - Suggested Action: Conduct regular fire safety drills and ensure all emergency exits are clear of obstructions.  

6. **Accessibility:**  
   - Minor steps at the entrance that hinder ease of access.  
   - Suggested Action: Elevate or modify the entrance to make it fully accessible.

### **6. Compliance Summary**

The building partially complies with current Finnish building regulations. Key areas of compliance include:  
- Fire safety measures are adequately implemented.  
- The electrical and plumbing systems meet basic functionality requirements, though they require modernization for efficiency and safety.  
- Accessibility standards are met to an acceptable level.  

Areas requiring improvement include the structural integrity (long-term maintenance) and the HVAC system (upgrade).

### **7. Conclusion**

The building is in satisfactory overall condition but requires attention to modernize or replace certain components to ensure long-term functionality and compliance with current regulations. Immediate action should be taken on the electrical, plumbing, and HVAC systems to improve efficiency and safety. The structural integrity will require periodic monitoring over the next decade.
