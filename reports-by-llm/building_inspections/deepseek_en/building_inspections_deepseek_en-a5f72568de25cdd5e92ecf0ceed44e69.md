---

### **3. Inspection Context**

The inspection was conducted on 25 October 2024 during mild autumn weather in Brändö Municipality. The temperature was moderate, with clear skies and occasional cloud cover. The purpose of the inspection was to perform a routine structural evaluation of the industrial building to ensure compliance with current Finnish building codes and safety standards.

### **4. Observations and Findings**

#### **Structural Integrity**
- The building appears structurally sound with no signs of uplift or bowing.
- EIFS (External Insulation and Finishing Systems) panels on the exterior are slightly warped but remain intact, indicating minimal thermal bridging through the walls.

#### **Electrical System**
- The electrical panel is operational and meets current Finnish standards for load-bearing capacity.
- Wiring is in good condition, though outdated connectors require replacement to ensure long-term reliability.

#### **Plumbing System**
- The plumbing system functions efficiently with no leaks or blockages. The drainage system has been recently flushed and appears clean.

#### **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC)**
- The HVAC units are in good working order and provide adequate temperature control.
- Thermostats and controls were tested and function correctly, but annual recalibration is recommended to ensure optimal performance.

#### **Fire Safety**
- The building complies with the latest Finnish fire safety regulations. Automatic sprinkler systems are functioning properly, and all exits meet minimum width requirements for their respective floors.

#### **Accessibility**
- The facility has basic accessibility features, including a ramp at the entrance and grab bars in the restroom.
- Handrails on the staircase are functional but could be enhanced with additional lighting for better visibility during nighttime inspections.

### **5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

| **Issue**                     | **Details**                                                                 | **Recommendation**                                                                 |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| EIFS Panels                  | Slight warping observed on the exterior panels.                              | Replace EIFS panels with more durable materials to reduce thermal bridging.       |
| Electrical Wiring             | Outdated connectors in the wiring system.                                      | Upgrade connectors and consider re-insulation of the electrical pathways.         |
| Thermal Bridging              | Minimal but detectable thermal bridging through cavity walls.                 | Improve cavity wall insulation or reinforce existing insulation with additional layers.|
| HVAC Efficiency               | Annual recalibration of HVAC units is recommended for optimal performance.     | Recalibrate and service HVAC systems to ensure energy efficiency.                  |
| Accessibility Features       | Handrails in the restroom require improvement for better visibility.          | Upgrade handrails with additional lighting and improved grab bars.                 |

### **6. Compliance Summary**

The building complies with Finnish building codes and regulations, except for minor issues that do not compromise safety or structural integrity. The primary areas requiring attention are EIFS maintenance, electrical system upgrades, and cavity wall insulation improvements.

---

### **7. Conclusion**

The industrial building in question is in good overall condition, with no major safety concerns. Minor updates to the electrical system, EIFS panels, and cavity walls would enhance its long-term performance and compliance with modern standards. A follow-up inspection in early 2025 is recommended to address the identified issues.
