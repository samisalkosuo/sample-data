### **4. Observations and Findings**  

#### **Structural Integrity**  
- The building appears structurally sound, with no visible signs of foundation settlement or major frame issues.  
- The wooden clapboard exterior shows signs of wear and tear consistent with its age (e.g., slight warping on the roof).  

#### **Electrical Systems**  
- The electrical panel is outdated but functional.  
- There are no obvious circuit overloads, but the wiring appears to be in need of modernization due to the building's age.  

#### **Plumbing Systems**  
- The plumbing system functions adequately for basic needs (e.g., heating, water supply).  
- There are signs of water damage on interior walls and ceiling, likely caused by condensation from the roof.  

#### **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC)**  
- The HVAC system is operational but inefficient due to outdated components.  
- No evidence of carbon monoxide leaks was detected during the inspection.  

#### **Fire Safety**  
- The building complies with Lapland's fire safety regulations in terms of exit widths and emergency lighting.  
- Fire extinguishers are present and functional, though they appear to be in need of maintenance.  

#### **Accessibility**  
- The property has a sloping front yard that makes access difficult for individuals with mobility challenges.  
- The interior lacks grab bars in the bathrooms, which could improve accessibility for elderly residents or those recovering from injuries.

   - Replace the outdated fuse box with a more robust, gfcb-rated circuit breaker system.  

3. **Plumbing Systems:**  
   - Address water damage by installing a moisture barrier and upgrading the plumbing system to a more efficient one.  

4. **HVAC System:**  
   - Upgrade the HVAC components to improve efficiency and reduce energy consumption.  

5. **Fire Safety:**  
   - Inspect and maintain fire extinguishers, ensuring they are functional and properly stored.

### **6. Compliance Summary**  
The building generally complies with Lapland's building regulations, but several areas require improvement to meet current standards. The primary non-compliance relates to outdated infrastructure (e.g., electrical wiring, plumbing systems) and structural materials (wood).

### **7. Conclusion**  
The residential building in Kaavi is structurally sound and functional for its intended use. However, it requires several upgrades to improve energy efficiency, accessibility, and safety. The recommendations outlined above will ensure the property remains safe, comfortable, and habitable in the long term. Follow-up inspections should be conducted within six months to assess the effectiveness of any implemented changes.
