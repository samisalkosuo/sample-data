### **4. Observations and Findings**  

#### **Structural Integrity**  
- The building appears structurally sound with no immediate threats to safety. However, signs of wear and tear are evident on the beams and columns, consistent with a 45-year-old structure.  

#### **Electrical Systems**  
- The electrical panel is outdated and requires modernization to meet current Finnish electrical codes.  

#### **Plumbing Systems**  
- The plumbing system shows signs of age but remains functional. Minor leaks are present in the pipes near the foundation, which may require relining for long-term stability.  

#### **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC)**  
- The HVAC system is inefficient and requires significant upgrades to improve energy efficiency and reduce operational costs.  

#### **Fire Safety**  
- The fire safety measures are adequate but could be enhanced with better insulation in the walls and ceiling.  

#### **Accessibility**  
- The building has basic accessibility features, but the stairs require modification to comply with modern Finnish accessibility standards.

### **6. Compliance Summary**  
The building is mostly compliant with local Finnish construction codes, but several areas require updates to ensure long-term safety and efficiency. The primary non-compliance relates to electrical and HVAC systems, which are critical for modern operational standards.

---

### **7. Conclusion**  
The industrial facility in Sotkamo appears structurally sound and capable of withstanding current environmental conditions. Minor updates to the electrical panel, plumbing system, HVAC equipment, fire safety measures, and accessibility features will enhance compliance with modern building codes and improve overall functionality.  

**Recommendation:** Conduct annual inspections to monitor structural integrity and update systems as needed.
