### **3. Inspection Context**  
The inspection was conducted on 17 February 2025 during a light snowstorm, with temperatures averaging -2°C (-8°F).

### **4. Observations and Findings**  
- **Structural Integrity:** The building appears structurally sound, with no signs of immediate collapse or instability. However, there are visible signs of wear and tear on the foundation and exterior cladding.  
- **Electrical Systems:** The electrical panel is operational but requires modernization to comply with current Finnish electrical codes due to outdated wiring and appliances.  
- **Plumbing Systems:** The plumbing system functions adequately for basic needs but shows signs of inefficiency, particularly in water heating. Modernization may be required to meet energy efficiency standards.  
- **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC):** The HVAC system is functional but requires annual maintenance to ensure optimal performance and compliance with building regulations.  
- **Fire Safety:** The property has working smoke detectors throughout the premises, but the fire extinguisher in the exit route is outdated and does not meet current safety standards.  
- **Accessibility:** The building includes a single staircase leading to the second floor, which may pose challenges for individuals with mobility impairments. A renovation project could include replacing this staircase with a more accessible design.

### **5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**  
1. **Structural Concerns:**  
   - The foundation shows signs of settlement due to soil instability over time.  
   - The exterior cladding requires repainting for long-term durability.  

2. **Electrical Systems:**  
   - Modernize the wiring system to meet current Finnish electrical codes (e.g., replacing outdated circuit breakers and upgrading to smart home technology).  

3. **Plumbing Systems:**  
   - Upgrade the plumbing system to improve energy efficiency, such as replacing old water pipes with low-flow fixtures.  

4. **HVAC System:**  
   - Schedule annual maintenance for optimal performance and compliance with building regulations.  

5. **Fire Safety:**  
   - Replace the outdated fire extinguisher with a modern, tested unit capable of containing small fires effectively.  

6. **Accessibility:**  
   - Modify the staircase to ensure it meets Finnish accessibility standards (e.g., installing a ramp or widening steps for easier access).  

---

### **6. Compliance Summary**  
The building is in good compliance with current Finnish building codes and regulations, except for the following areas:  
- Electrical systems require modernization to meet updated codes.  
- Plumbing and HVAC systems are nearing the end of their useful life and may need significant upgrades.  
- Fire safety measures are adequate but could be improved by updating the fire extinguisher and smoke detectors.  

---

### **7. Conclusion**  
The commercial building in Marttila, Finland, is in satisfactory condition overall but requires attention to modernization and accessibility improvements to ensure long-term compliance with building regulations and safety standards. A follow-up inspection is recommended within six months after implementing the identified fixes.
