### **4. Observations and Findings**

#### **Structural Integrity**  
- The building appears structurally sound, with no visible signs of foundation settlement or major frame issues. However, the reinforced concrete columns show signs of minor stress cracks, likely due to thermal expansion over the years.

#### **Electrical Systems**  
- The electrical wiring is outdated and requires modernization. There are several receptacles without proper circuit breakers, and the lighting fixtures are in need of replacement.

#### **Plumbing Systems**  
- The plumbing system appears functional but shows signs of wear and tear. The pipes are slightly worn, and there are a few leaks near the foundation that could be addressed with minimal effort.

#### **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC)**  
- The HVAC system is operational but inefficient. Energy consumption levels are higher than recommended for a building of this size. There is also no central heating or cooling system installed, which may pose challenges in the future.

#### **Fire Safety**  
- Fire extinguishers are present and functional, but they do not comply with modern international standards. The fire blankets are outdated and require replacement.

#### **Accessibility**  
- The building has a single staircase leading to the second floor, which is somewhat hazardous for older individuals or those with mobility issues. A full set of stairs or an elevator would improve accessibility significantly.

| Inefficient HVAC System         | The current system is underutilized due to higher energy consumption.          | Upgrade to an efficient HVAC system with modern controls and better insulation.    |
| Outdated Fire Extinguisher      | Fire extinguishers do not meet current standards, and fire blankets are outdated.  | Replace all fire extinguishers and install new fire blankets as per regulations.     |
| Single Staircase               | A single staircase poses a risk for accessibility.                             | Convert the staircase to a full set of stairs or install an elevator.            |
