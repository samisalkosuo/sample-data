### **3. Inspection Context**  
The inspection was conducted on 31.12.2024, during a cold and snowy weather condition typical for Lapland in late December. The temperature was recorded at -5°C, with light snowfall expected throughout the day. The purpose of this inspection was to conduct a routine structural check of the community hall to ensure compliance with current building regulations and to assess its readiness for potential resale or renovation.

### **4. Observations and Findings**  

#### **Structural Integrity:**  
- The building appears structurally sound, with no visible signs of foundation settlement or major frame issues. However, there are signs of wear and tear on the wooden planks, particularly in areas subjected to seasonal temperature fluctuations.  

#### **Electrical Systems:**  
- The electrical panel is outdated and requires modernization to comply with current Finnish building codes. The lighting fixtures are inefficient and require upgrading for energy efficiency.  

#### **Plumbing Systems:**  
- The plumbing system shows signs of age-related clogs in the pipes, which may necessitate professional cleaning or replacement. The water heater is within operational limits but lacks an energy-efficient tankless system.  

#### **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC):**  
- The HVAC system operates efficiently during the inspection period but shows signs of inefficiency due to outdated ductwork and lack of insulation around pipes. Upgrading this system would improve energy efficiency in future winters.  

#### **Fire Safety:**  
- The fire extinguisher is functional and maintained, but the fire safety rating (VPS) has not been updated since construction. The emergency exit signage is legible, but additional lighting in the疏散 route is required to comply with current regulations.  

#### **Accessibility:**  
- The building has a single staircase leading to the second floor, which does not meet Finnish accessibility standards for older buildings. A new ramp or an accessible staircase must be installed to ensure compliance and safety for all users.

### **5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**  
1. **Structural Concerns:**  
   - Regular maintenance of wooden planks to prevent moisture damage due to seasonal temperature changes.  
   - Modernize the electrical panel to meet current Finnish building codes.  

2. **Plumbing Systems:**  
   - Replace clogged pipes with a professional cleaning service or install a new system.  
   - Upgrade the water heater to an energy-efficient tankless model.  

3. **HVAC System:**  
   - Replace outdated ductwork and insulate pipes around them for improved efficiency.  

4. **Fire Safety:**  
   - Update the fire extinguisher's rating (VPS) as per current regulations.  
   - Reinforce emergency exit signage with additional lighting in the疏散 route.  

5. **Accessibility:**  
   - Install a new ramp or replace the existing single staircase to meet Finnish accessibility standards for older buildings.

### **6. Compliance Summary**  
The building is compliant with current Finnish building codes where possible, such as:  
- Fire safety measures (VPS rating and emergency exit signage).  
- Basic structural integrity.  

However, several areas require attention to ensure full compliance with updated regulations, particularly in the following categories:  
- Electrical systems (modernization of panels).  
- Plumbing systems (efficiency upgrades).  
- HVAC system (energy efficiency improvements).  
- Accessibility standards (upgrading staircases and signage).  

---

### **7. Conclusion**  
The community hall is in good overall condition but requires several updates to meet current building codes and improve functionality. Immediate action is recommended for the electrical panel, plumbing systems, and accessibility upgrades. The HVAC system should be upgraded to enhance energy efficiency in future winters. A full compliance assessment will be conducted post-upgrades to ensure all regulations are met.  

**Recommendation:** Conduct a follow-up inspection within 6 months after implementing the identified fixes to verify compliance with updated building codes.
