### **3. Inspection Context**  
The inspection was conducted on 14 March 2025 during mild spring weather in Jämsä, Finland. The temperature was approximately 10°C, with partly cloudy skies and light rain expected at the time of the inspection. The purpose of this inspection was to conduct a routine structural evaluation of the commercial building to ensure compliance with current Finnish building codes and standards.

### **4. Observations and Findings**  
- **Structural Integrity:** The building appears structurally sound, with no signs of major subsidence or bowing. However, there are minor signs of settlement in the foundation area, likely due to differential settling over time.  
- **Electrical Systems:** The electrical panel is operational but shows signs of wear and tear on the wiring connections. There are no unauthorized modifications to the existing electrical system.  
- **Plumbing Systems:** The plumbing system appears functional, with proper circulation of water through the heating and cooling systems. No evidence of leaks or clogs was observed during the inspection.  
- **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC):** The HVAC system is operational and functioning within acceptable parameters. The ductwork shows signs of minor damage consistent with age but does not impede normal operation.  
- **Fire Safety:** The fire safety systems are functional and in accordance with Finnish regulations. Fire extinguishers are present and maintained, and the emergency exit signage is clear and legible.  
- **Accessibility:** The building meets current accessibility standards for commercial spaces. All exits, staircases, and doorways are functional and wide enough for standard mobility equipment.

### **5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**  
1. **Foundation Settlement:** Minor settlement in the foundation area (0.5 cm across the footprint). Recommendation: Conduct a full structural evaluation to determine if additional stabilization measures are necessary.  
2. **Electrical Wiring Connections:** Visible wear on wiring connections at several junctions. Recommendation: Replace all electrical wiring connections and re-insulate the wiring as per current standards.  
3. **Plumbing System:** No significant issues observed, but recommend annual maintenance of the plumbing system to ensure continued efficiency.  
4. **HVAC Ductwork:** Minor damage to the ductwork consistent with age. Recommendation: Reinsulate and relining the HVAC ductwork for improved energy efficiency.  
5. **Fire Safety Systems:** No identified issues; however, ensure that all fire extinguishers are maintained in good condition and that emergency exit signage is clearly visible.  

---

### **6. Compliance Summary**  
The building does not fully comply with modern Finnish building regulations due to the age of its construction (1980) and the materials used. Key areas requiring improvement include electrical wiring, HVAC ductwork, and foundation stability. However, the building meets basic compliance criteria for structural integrity, fire safety, and accessibility.  

---

### **7. Conclusion**  
The commercial building in Jämsä is structurally sound but requires minor updates to meet current standards. The identified issues are actionable and do not pose immediate safety risks. It is recommended to schedule follow-up inspections within 6 months to ensure continued compliance with Finnish building codes.
