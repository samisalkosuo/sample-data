### **4. Observations and Findings**  

#### **Structural Integrity:**  
- The building appears structurally sound with no visible signs of major sagging or bowing in the beams. However, there are signs of minor settlement in the foundation that may require monitoring over time.  

#### **Electrical System:**  
- The electrical wiring is outdated and requires modernization to meet current Finnish safety standards. Several receptacles are overloaded, posing a risk of fire if overloaded further.  

#### **Plumbing System:**  
- The plumbing system shows signs of mildew growth on the pipes due to inadequate drainage in certain areas. A full inspection of the pipe network is recommended to address this issue.  

#### **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC):**  
- The HVAC system operates efficiently but lacks energy efficiency ratings. Upgrading to a more efficient model could reduce energy consumption and maintenance costs.  

#### **Fire Safety:**  
- Fire extinguishers are present in the building, but they do not comply with current Finnish fire safety regulations. New fire extinguishers with higher capacity should be installed.  

#### **Accessibility:**  
- The building has basic accessibility features for wheelchairs, such as a ramp at the entrance and grab bars in the bathroom. However, the main staircase lacks sufficient handrails and may pose challenges for individuals with mobility issues.

### **5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**  

| **Issue**                                      | **Recommendation**                                                                 |
|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Outdated electrical wiring                       | Upgrade to modern circuit breakers and receptacles.                              |
| Mildew growth on plumbing system                 | Replace affected pipes with energy-efficient drainage systems.                   |
| Inadequate fire safety equipment                 | Install compliant fire extinguishers (Class A or B) with pressure-rated hoses.  |
| Basic accessibility features                    | Add handrails to the main staircase and ensure all exits are at a 4:1 slope ratio.|
| Sagging beams in foundation                      | Monitor for further settlement; consider partial reinforcement if necessary.     |

### **6. Compliance Summary**  
The building partially complies with Finnish building regulations but requires significant upgrades to meet modern standards, particularly in electrical and plumbing systems. The HVAC system is operational but could be upgraded for efficiency.

---

### **7. Conclusion**  
The Karijoki Industrial Park building is in good overall condition, free from major structural issues. However, it requires updates to its electrical, plumbing, and HVAC systems to ensure compliance with current regulations and safety standards. Annual inspections should continue to monitor the building's structural integrity and system performance.
