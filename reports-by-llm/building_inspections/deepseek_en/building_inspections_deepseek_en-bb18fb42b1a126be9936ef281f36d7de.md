### **4. Observations and Findings**  

#### **Structural Integrity**  
- The building appears structurally sound overall, with no visible signs of foundation settlement or major frame issues. However, there are minor cracks in the brickwork on the second floor that appear to be consistent with age-related expansion and contraction.

#### **Electrical Systems**  
- The electrical panel is operational but shows signs of wear and tear. Two of the lighting fixtures (out of 20) require replacement due to outdated wiring and insufficient circuit breakers.

#### **Plumbing Systems**  
- The plumbing system functions adequately, with no visible leaks or clogs. However, the water heater is showing signs of inefficiency, requiring a minor adjustment to its temperature settings for optimal performance.

#### **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC)**  
- The HVAC system operates efficiently during the inspection but shows signs of wear on the outdoor unit fins. Regular maintenance should be scheduled to prevent future issues.

#### **Fire Safety**  
- The fire extinguisher is functional and in good condition. However, the sprinkler system has not been tested recently, raising concerns about its reliability in case of emergencies.

#### **Accessibility**  
- The building provides reasonable access for all users, but the main staircase requires a small step adjustment to accommodate individuals with mobility challenges.
