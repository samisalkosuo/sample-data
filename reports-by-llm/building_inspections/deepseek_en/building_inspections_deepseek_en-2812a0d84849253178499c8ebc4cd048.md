### **5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**  

| **Issue**                     | **Details**                                                                 | **Recommendation**                                                                 |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------:|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| Wall Cracks                   | Visible cracks on the foundation walls (likely from construction).        | Repairs to stabilize the structure and prevent further cracking.                |
| Outdated Electrical Wiring     | Terminal blocks show signs of wear, potentially exposing live wires.      | Upgrade or relabel the wiring for safety compliance.                            |
| Blockage in Drainage System   | Minor blockages in the drainage system (likely due to construction debris).  | Cleaning and maintenance during renovation to prevent future issues.             |
| Inefficient Insulation        | Thermal bridging observed between external walls, affecting energy efficiency.| Retrofit insulation to improve thermal performance.                           |
| Failed Smoke Detector         | One smoke detector is non-functional; additional detectors are needed.      | Installation of new smoke detectors throughout the building.                     |
| Uneven Floors                | Slight unevenness in the floor structure (likely from construction vibrations).| Leveling and stabilizing the foundation to ensure structural integrity.          |
