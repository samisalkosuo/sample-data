**4. Observations and Findings**  

- **Structural Integrity**:  
  - The building appears structurally sound with no visible cracks or变形 in the steel frame. However, there are signs of minor settlement at the foundation level due to differential settling over the years.  

- **Electrical Systems**:  
  - The electrical wiring is intact and functional. Minor issues include outdated circuit breakers that need updating to meet current standards.  

- **Plumbing Systems**:  
  - The plumbing system functions well, with no visible leaks or clogs. However, the pipes are showing signs of fatigue and may require upgrading in the next decade.  

- **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC)**:  
  - The HVAC system is operational but shows signs of wear and tear. The cooling coils need to be inspected for efficiency, and the ductwork requires cleaning.  

- **Fire Safety**:  
  - Fire extinguishers are present and functional. The fire safety regulations are met, but there is room for improvement in fire-rated insulation.  

- **Accessibility**:  
  - The property has basic accessibility features, including a ramp at the entrance and grab bars in the bathrooms. However, the elevator does not meet modern accessibility standards due to outdated controls and lighting.
