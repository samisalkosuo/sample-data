### **4. Observations and Findings**  
- **Structural Integrity:** The building appears structurally sound, with no signs of major subsidence or foundation issues. However, there are visible signs of wear and tear on the brickwork, particularly around the foundations.  
- **Electrical Systems:** The electrical panel is operational but shows signs of age. Two of the outdoor electrical boxes require repainting due to peeling paint.  
- **Water Supply & Drainage:** The water supply system functions adequately, but there are small cracks in the pipes located on the second floor. No significant water damage was observed during the inspection.  
- **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC):** The HVAC system operates efficiently, but the refrigerant levels are slightly below the recommended minimum. A service call is scheduled for the following week to address this.  
- **Fire Safety:** The fire extinguisher is functional and in good condition. Fire safety labels on all exits and emergency equipment are intact.  
- **Accessibility:** The building has a ramp accessible to the first floor, but stairs leading to higher floors are not compliant with ADA standards (Americans with Disabilities Act). A small staircase modification is recommended for full accessibility compliance.
