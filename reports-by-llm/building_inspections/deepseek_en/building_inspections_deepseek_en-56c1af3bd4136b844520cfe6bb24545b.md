### **4. Observations and Findings**  
- **Structural Integrity:**  
  - The building exhibits signs of age-related wear and tear. There are visible cracks in the brickwork along the foundation (Figure 1).  
  - The wooden beams supporting the second floor show minor warping, consistent with the building's age and use over the years.  

- **Electrical Systems:**  
  - The electrical wiring is outdated but functional. The last inspection of the electrical system was conducted in 2015, and no major issues were identified at this time.  

- **Plumbing Systems:**  
  - The plumbing system appears to function adequately, but there are signs of water damage on the ceiling due to leaking pipes (Figure 2).  

- **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC):**  
  - The HVAC system is operational but shows signs of inefficiency. The heating core requires annual maintenance for optimal performance.  

- **Fire Safety:**  
  - The smoke detectors are functional, but the automatic fire alarm system was last tested in 2018. The emergency exit signs and window smoke detectors are non-functional due to age-related issues (Figure 3).  

- **Accessibility:**  
  - The building has a sloped entrance, which is not accessible for individuals with mobility impairments. Additionally, the hinges on all exterior doors have rusted and require replacement.

### **5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**  
1. **Structural Issues:**  
   - Cracks in the brickwork along the foundation (Figure 1).  
   - Minor warping of wooden beams supporting the second floor.  
   - **Recommendation:** Conduct a full structural assessment to determine if additional reinforcements are necessary.  

2. **Plumbing Issues:**  
   - Leaking pipes on the ceiling due to water damage.  
   - **Recommendation:** Replace the leaking pipes and inspect for underlying water sources.  

3. **Fire Safety Issues:**  
   - Non-functional emergency exit signs and window smoke detectors.  
   - Automatic fire alarm system not in working order (Figure 3).  
   - **Recommendation:** Update the fire safety systems to meet current regulations and install additional non-replaceable smoke detectors on upper floors.  

4. **Accessibility Issues:**  
   - Sloped entrance and rusted door hinges.  
   - **Recommendation:** Modify the entrance to be level with the sidewalk and replace all affected door hinges immediately.  

5. **Maintenance:**  
   - The HVAC system requires annual maintenance to ensure optimal performance.  
   - **Recommendation:** Schedule routine maintenance for the HVAC system starting in the next six months.

### **6. Compliance Summary**  
The building partially complies with current Finnish building regulations but fails several key compliance criteria related to fire safety, structural integrity, and accessibility. A follow-up inspection is recommended within 12 months to ensure all issues are addressed and compliance standards are met.  

---

### **7. Conclusion**  
The building in question has a good overall condition for its age, with no immediate safety risks. However, several areas require attention to ensure long-term stability and compliance with building codes. Immediate action is recommended on the fire safety and accessibility issues identified during this inspection.
