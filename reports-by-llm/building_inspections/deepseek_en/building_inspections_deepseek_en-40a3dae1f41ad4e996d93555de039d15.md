### **5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

1. **Exterior Insulation:**  
   - The building requires improved insulation to prevent moisture damage from the exterior walls.  
   - **Recommendation:** Upgrade to a high-performance insulation system, such as rigid foam panels or spray foam, to enhance thermal performance and reduce energy consumption.  

2. **Electrical Systems:**  
   - The electrical wiring is outdated and needs modernization to meet current safety standards.  
   - **Recommendation:** Replace the wiring with a combination of gf-Certified circuit breakers and updated insulation for better protection against faults.  

3. **Plumbing System:**  
   - The plumbing system requires upgrading due to poor insulation, which has led to water damage on ceiling tiles in the attic area.  
   - **Recommendation:** Install a heat-loss prevention system or upgrade to a more efficient plumbing setup with proper insulation for better thermal performance.  

4. **HVAC Efficiency:**  
   - The HVAC system is operational but shows inefficiencies that could be optimized.  
   - **Recommendation:** Upgrade the HVAC system to a high-efficiency model and install modern controls for better energy management.  

5. **Fire Safety:**  
   - Fire extinguishers are functional, but additional training should be provided to all building occupants on proper usage and maintenance.  
   - **Recommendation:** Conduct regular fire safety drills and ensure that all emergency exits are clear of obstructions.
