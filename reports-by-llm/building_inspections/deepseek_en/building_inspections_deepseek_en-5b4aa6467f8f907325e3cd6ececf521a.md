### **3. Inspection Context**

The inspection was conducted on 15 November 2024 in Konnevesi, a small industrial town in southern Finland. The weather conditions were mild to cold, with mist in the air due to recent rain showers. The temperature was around -5°C, which is typical for this time of year in the region.

The purpose of this inspection was to evaluate the structural integrity and compliance with current Finnish building codes. Given the age of the building (45 years since construction), it was expected that some wear and tear might be present, but no major safety concerns were anticipated.

### **4. Observations and Findings**

#### **Structural Integrity**  
- The building appears structurally sound with no signs of immediate collapse or instability. All load-bearing walls and beams are intact.  

#### **Electrical Systems**  
- The electrical wiring is outdated, with several junction boxes showing signs of corrosion. Two of the lighting fixtures (out of 10) were non-functional due to damaged wiring.  

#### **Plumbing Systems**  
- The plumbing system appears functional, but there are visible stains on the pipes from years of untreated rainwater seeping through the roof.  

#### **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC)**  
- The HVAC system is operational and maintains a comfortable temperature inside. However, there are signs of mildew growth on the ventilation ducts due to insufficient air circulation during colder months.  

#### **Fire Safety**  
- Fire extinguishers are present in all common areas, but they are outdated and not functional. Fire blankets are also overdue for replacement.  

#### **Accessibility**  
- The building has basic accessibility features, including a ramp at the entrance and grab bars in the bathrooms. However, there is no elevator, which could pose challenges for older residents or individuals with mobility impairments.

### **6. Compliance Summary**

The building complies with current Finnish building codes in terms of structural integrity, fire safety, and accessibility features. However, it is slightly outdated in areas such as electrical systems, plumbing, and fire safety equipment. Updates to these systems are recommended to ensure long-term compliance with modern regulations.
