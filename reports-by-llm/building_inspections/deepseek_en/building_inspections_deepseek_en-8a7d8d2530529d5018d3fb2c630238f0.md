### **1. General Information**  
- **Country:** Finland  
- **Municipality:** Finström  
- **Address:** 12A Industrial Estate, Finström, Lapland  
- **Inspection Date:** 10.06.2025 (DD.MM.YYYY)  
- **Inspector Name:** Oksana Kovalenko  

---

### **2. Building Overview**  
- **Building Type:** Industrial (Factory/Warehouse)  
- **Construction Year:** 1972  
- **Number of Floors:** 3 (with two mezzanines for additional storage and functionality)  
- **Primary Materials:** Brick, concrete, steel beams, reinforced concrete foundation  

---

### **3. Inspection Context**  
The inspection was conducted on 10 June 2025 during a cold spell with temperatures averaging -8°C (-14°F), reaching as low as -12°C (-29°F) due to strong northern winds. The weather conditions were extreme, necessitating the use of additional heating and de-icing systems. The purpose of this inspection was to ensure compliance with current Finnish building regulations while evaluating the structural integrity and functionality of the facility for potential reuse or conversion into a multi-family residential building.

### **4. Observations and Findings**  

#### **Structural Integrity**  
- The building appears structurally sound, with no visible signs of foundation collapse or major frame issues. However, the primary load-bearing walls were constructed using outdated brickwork that lacks modern reinforcement, which may impact long-term stability in extreme weather conditions.

#### **Electrical System**  
- The electrical wiring is outdated and requires modernization to meet current Finnish electrical codes. There are visible signs of corrosion on the overhead panels, necessitating replacement or relocation to a more durable material.

#### **Plumbing System**  
- The plumbing system appears functional but shows signs of wear and tear. The pipes in the basement are cracked and require repair to prevent water leakage into adjacent structures. The drainage system is operational but could benefit from an upgrade to improve efficiency and safety.

#### **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC)**  
- The HVAC system functions adequately for maintaining indoor temperatures during extreme cold. However, there are signs of inefficiency in the ductwork, which may require optimization for better energy performance.

#### **Fire Safety**  
- The fire extinguishers are functional but not compliant with updated Finnish fire safety regulations. Additional training and updated equipment are recommended to ensure compliance.

#### **Accessibility**  
- The facility is accessible by a single staircase leading to the upper floors. However, the handrails on this staircase are worn out and require replacement for safety reasons.

### **6. Compliance Summary**  
The building complies with Finnish construction regulations but requires minor updates to fully comply with current standards, particularly in electrical wiring, plumbing, HVAC efficiency, fire safety, and accessibility.

---

### **7. Conclusion**  
The industrial facility is structurally sound and functional for its intended use. However, it requires minor upgrades to meet modern building codes and improve energy efficiency. The inspection report recommends addressing the identified issues promptly to ensure long-term compliance and safety.
