### **3. Inspection Context**  
The inspection was conducted at the request of the local building authority, as part of a routine structural check to ensure compliance with Finnish building regulations. The primary purpose of this inspection was to evaluate the overall structural integrity and safety of the property.

---

### **4. Observations and Findings**  

#### **Structural Integrity**  
- The building appears structurally sound, with no signs of immediate collapse or instability. However, there are some minor concerns regarding the foundation's load-bearing capacity due to seasonal variations in soil conditions.  

#### **Electrical System**  
- The electrical panel is operational and functioning within acceptable limits. The circuit breakers have been tested and are free from faults.  

#### **Plumbing System**  
- The plumbing system appears functional, with no significant leaks or malfunctions detected during the inspection. However, the water heater is outdated and requires modernization to comply with current energy efficiency standards.  

#### **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC)**  
- The HVAC system operates efficiently, but there are signs of wear on the ductwork. Regular maintenance should be scheduled to ensure optimal performance.  

#### **Fire Safety**  
- The fire extinguisher is functional and in good working condition. Fire doors are operational and meet safety standards.  

#### **Accessibility**  
- The property has been modified for accessibility, with a raised entrance and handrails on the staircase. However, there are minor steps that could be improved for ease of use.

### **5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**  

1. **Fire Safety:**  
   - Minor concerns regarding fire extinguisher placement in certain areas (e.g., near the kitchen). A full audit of all emergency exits and fire suppression systems is recommended to ensure compliance with Finnish fire safety regulations.  

2. **Plumbing System:**  
   - The water heater is 10 years old and requires replacement or upgrade to meet current energy efficiency standards. Upgrading will also improve water heating performance and reduce energy consumption.  

3. **Structural Integrity:**  
   - The foundation has shown signs of settlement due to seasonal soil conditions. A professional structural assessment should be conducted to ensure long-term stability.  

4. **Fire Safety:**  
   - Fire doors in all bedrooms need to be tested for proper operation under fire conditions. This is a simple and effective measure to enhance occupant safety.  

5. **Accessibility:**  
   - The handrails on the staircase could be made sturdier to accommodate individuals with mobility challenges. Additionally, ensuring that all ramps are within acceptable slope limits (1:12) will improve accessibility for all users.

### **6. Compliance Summary**  
The building generally complies with Finnish building regulations and local fire safety codes. However, there are a few areas where improvements can be made to ensure full compliance and enhanced safety standards. The primary non-compliance relates to the age of the water heater and outdated fire extinguisher systems.

---

### **7. Conclusion**  
The property is in good overall condition, with no immediate safety risks. Minor updates to the plumbing system, fire safety measures, and accessibility features are recommended to ensure long-term occupancy safety and compliance with building regulations. A follow-up inspection within 6 months will be conducted to verify the implementation of these recommendations.
