### **4. Observations and Findings**  

#### **Structural Integrity**  
- The building appears structurally sound with no signs of immediate collapse or instability. The brickwork on the first floor shows minor wear consistent with age but remains stable under current occupancy loads.  

#### **Electrical Systems**  
- The electrical panel is operational, but there are signs of outdated wiring in several areas. Replacing the outdated circuit breakers and upgrading the circuit protection devices (CPDs) is recommended to ensure compliance with modern building codes.  

#### **Plumbing Systems**  
- The plumbing system functions effectively under normal conditions. However, the efficiency of the water supply and drainage systems could be improved through minor upgrades to reduce water losses during high-occupancy periods.  

#### **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC)**  
- The HVAC system operates efficiently but shows signs of wear on the outdoor unit fins. Scheduling routine maintenance for the HVAC components is recommended to ensure optimal performance throughout the heating season.  

#### **Fire Safety**  
- Fire extinguishers are present in all public areas, but they are outdated and do not meet current fire safety standards. Upgrading the fire extinguishers to Class A or B-rated models is essential for compliance with Finnish building regulations.  

#### **Accessibility**  
- The building has basic accessibility features, including a ramp at the entrance and grab bars in the restroom. However, the main staircase lacks handrails on both sides, posing a minor risk of falls during peak occupancy periods. Upgrading this section to meet ADA standards is recommended.

### **5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**  
1. **Structural Concerns:**  
   - Minor wear on brickwork (repointing bricks every 10 years).  
   - Outdated wiring in electrical systems (upgrade CPDs within 2 years).  

2. **Plumbing Concerns:**  
   - Inefficient water supply and drainage systems (minor upgrades within 3 years).  

3. **HVAC Concerns:**  
   - Outdoor unit fins show wear (schedule routine maintenance every 5 years).  

4. **Fire Safety Concerns:**  
   - Outdated fire extinguishers (upgrade to Class A/B-rated models immediately).  

5. **Accessibility Concerns:**  
   - Lack of handrails on main staircase (upgrade within 2 years).  

---

### **6. Compliance Summary**  
The building partially complies with current Finnish building regulations:  
- Electrical systems are operational but require minor upgrades to CPDs and wiring.  
- Plumbing systems function effectively but could benefit from efficiency upgrades.  
- HVAC system is functional but requires routine maintenance.  
- Fire safety measures are non-compliant due to outdated extinguishers, requiring immediate attention.  
- Accessibility features meet current standards with one minor deficiency in the main staircase.

### **7. Conclusion**  
The commercial building at P.O. Box 357, Merikarvia, FI-02567, is structurally sound and functional but requires several upgrades to fully comply with modern building codes and safety standards. Immediate action is recommended for the fire extinguishers, while other issues should be addressed within the next two years to ensure long-term compliance.  

**Recommendation:** Follow-up inspection scheduled for 15 September 2024 to verify the implementation of recommended upgrades.
