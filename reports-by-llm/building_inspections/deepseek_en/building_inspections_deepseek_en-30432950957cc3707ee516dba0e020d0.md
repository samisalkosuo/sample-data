### **4. Observations and Findings**  

#### **Structural Integrity**  
- The building appears structurally sound overall, with no immediate signs of bowing or uneven settling. However, the primary beams in the second floor (first office level) show signs of fatigue due to prolonged use over the past decade.

#### **Electrical Systems**  
- The electrical panel is outdated and requires modernization to comply with current Finnish Building Codes (Building Code 2018). Several circuits are overloaded, posing a risk of overheating during peak demand.

#### **Plumbing Systems**  
- The plumbing system in the basement has reached its end of life. The pipes are corroded and require replacement or relocation to ensure compliance with health regulations.

#### **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC)**  
- The HVAC system is operational but not energy-efficient. Annual maintenance is recommended to improve performance and reduce energy consumption.

#### **Fire Safety**  
- Fire extinguishers are present in all public areas, but they are outdated and require replacement. Fire detectors are functional but lack regular testing.

#### **Accessibility**  
- The building has basic accessibility features, including a ramp at the entrance and elevators for upper floors. However, the elevator doors do not meet modern accessibility standards due to inadequate clearance.
