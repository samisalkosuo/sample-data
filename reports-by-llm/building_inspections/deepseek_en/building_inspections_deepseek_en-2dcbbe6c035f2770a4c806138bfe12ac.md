### **4. Observations and Findings**
- **Structural Integrity**:  
  - The wooden beams supporting the second floor were slightly outdated, necessitating replacement within the next five years to maintain structural stability.  
  - The foundation was intact but showed signs of minor settlement, likely due to seasonal variations in soil moisture.  

- **Electrical Systems**:  
  - Loose wiring connections were identified in the kitchen and bathrooms, posing a risk of electrical malfunctions or fire hazards if not addressed promptly.  

- **Plumbing Systems**:  
  - A few water pipes near the basement exhibited signs of mildew growth, indicating potential corrosion issues that require immediate attention to prevent mold development.  

- **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC)**:  
  - The central heating system was functioning within its design limits but required annual servicing to ensure optimal performance during colder months.  

- **Fire Safety**:  
  - The smoke detectors were outdated and did not meet current Finnish fire safety regulations. Upgrading these systems is recommended to enhance occupant protection in case of emergencies.
