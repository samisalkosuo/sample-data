### **4. Observations and Findings**

- **Structural Integrity:**  
  - The foundation appears intact but shows signs of settlement due to differential ground compression over the years.  
  - The beams in the second floor are slightly cracked at the joints, likely from repeated load cycles.  

- **Electrical Systems:**  
  - The electrical panel is outdated and requires modernization to meet current Finnish electrical codes.  
  - There are no apparent short circuits or live wire incidents reported recently.  

- **Plumbing Systems:**  
  - The water supply system functions correctly, but regular maintenance is recommended to prevent future issues.  
  - The drainage system shows signs of wear and tear on the pipes near the foundation.  

- **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC):**  
  - The heating system operates efficiently during inspections, with no visible leaks or malfunctions.  
  - The HVAC unit is several years past its service life and requires replacement to meet energy efficiency standards.  

- **Fire Safety:**  
  - The fire extinguisher on the premises is functional but not compliant with the latest Finnish fire safety regulations.  
  - The smoke detectors are operational, but additional units should be installed in high-risk areas.  

- **Accessibility:**  
  - The main entrance includes a ramp for wheelchair access, which was installed during the last renovation.  
  - The second floor has stairs leading to the community room; these need to be replaced with a ramp for compliance with accessibility standards.

| **Issue**                                                                 | **Recommendation**                                                                 |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Outdated foundation components requiring replacement.                   | Replace the affected beams and settle the foundation to prevent further settlement.    |
| Non-compliant electrical panel requiring modernization.                  | Upgrade the electrical system to meet current Finnish building codes.                |
| Old water supply pipes showing signs of wear.                           | Schedule regular maintenance or replace the affected pipes.                         |
| Outdated HVAC unit with insufficient energy efficiency.                 | Replace the HVAC unit with a modern, energy-efficient model.                        |
| Non-compliant fire extinguisher.                                         | Update the fire safety equipment to meet current regulations.                        |
| Stairs in the second floor not compliant with accessibility standards.  | Replace the stairs with ramps to ensure full compliance with Finnish accessibility standards.

### **6. Compliance Summary**

The building does not fully comply with current Finnish building codes, particularly regarding electrical systems, HVAC efficiency, and fire safety. However, all identified issues are actionable and can be resolved without significant disruption to normal operations. Modernizing the electrical panel, replacing outdated HVAC units, and upgrading accessibility features will ensure compliance.

---

### **7. Conclusion**

The community center is structurally sound but requires several updates to meet modern building standards. The inspection highlights necessary maintenance and upgrades that are both practical and cost-effective. Following these recommendations will not only improve the facility’s safety and efficiency but also enhance its long-term value for public use.
