### **4. Observations and Findings**  

#### **Structural Integrity**  
- The building appears structurally sound, with no visible signs of subsidence or leaning. However, there are minor signs of wear on the steel beams supporting the second floor, consistent with their age (2008 construction).  

#### **Electrical Systems**  
- The electrical panel is outdated and requires modernization to meet current Finnish electrical codes. There are no live wires in inaccessible areas, but the system could benefit from an upgrade for safety and efficiency.  

#### **Plumbing Systems**  
- The plumbing system appears functional, with proper circulation of water through the heating and cooling systems. However, there are visible stains on the inner walls due to condensation during warmer months.  

#### **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC)**  
- The HVAC system is operational and provides comfortable temperatures inside. However, its efficiency could be improved with modern technology to reduce energy consumption.  

#### **Fire Safety**  
- Fire extinguishers are present and functional. The fire exit door opens smoothly, but there is no smoke detector in the basement level.  

#### **Accessibility**  
- The building has a ramp accessible to all floors, meeting accessibility standards for individuals with mobility challenges.
