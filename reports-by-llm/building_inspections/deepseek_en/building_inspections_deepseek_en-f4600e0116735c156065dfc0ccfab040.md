### **4. Observations and Findings**  
- **Structural:** The building appears structurally sound, with no visible signs of foundation collapse or major frame issues. However, there are minor signs of moisture damage around the basement entrance, likely due to condensation from seasonal temperature fluctuations.  
- **Electrical:** The electrical system is functional but shows signs of wear and tear on several circuit breakers. Upgrading these components is recommended for long-term reliability.  
- **Plumbing:** The plumbing system operates efficiently, with no visible leaks or clogs. However, the water heater is outdated and requires modernization to meet current energy efficiency standards.  
- **Heating and Cooling (HVAC):** The HVAC system functions adequately but shows signs of inefficiency due to outdated ductwork and refrigerant condition. Upgrading to a high-efficiency system is advised.  
- **Fire Safety:** The fire safety measures are compliant with Finnish regulations, including functional smoke detectors and tested emergency exits. No visible breaches or non-compliance were observed.  
- **Accessibility:** The property meets accessibility standards for residential use, with a fully operational staircase and accommodative doorways.
