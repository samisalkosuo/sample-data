### **2. Building Overview**  
- **Building Type:** Industrial  
- **Construction Year:** 2008  
- **Number of Floors:** 5  
- **Primary Materials:** Steel beams and reinforced concrete foundation; exterior cladding: steel panels with insulation (mineral wool).  

---

### **3. Inspection Context**  
The inspection was conducted on 30 January 2025, during a cold and snowy day in northern Finland. The temperature was recorded at -10°C (-14°F), and light snowfall was observed throughout the day. The purpose of this inspection was to conduct a routine structural evaluation of the industrial building to ensure compliance with current building codes and standards.

### **4. Observations and Findings**  

#### **Structural Integrity**  
- The building appears structurally sound, with no visible signs of immediate collapse or instability. However, there are some signs of wear and tear consistent with its age (2008 construction).  

#### **Electrical Systems**  
- The electrical panel is outdated and requires modernization to meet current European Union standards for energy efficiency and safety.  

#### **Plumbing Systems**  
- The plumbing system shows signs of mildew growth on the exterior walls, likely due to inadequate ventilation or poor insulation in certain areas.  

#### **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC)**  
- The HVAC system is functional but inefficient compared to modern standards. Additional energy-efficient equipment could be installed to reduce operational costs.  

#### **Fire Safety**  
- The fire safety systems are functional and meet current Finnish regulations. However, the alarm system requires updating to include more sensitive detection mechanisms for early fire warnings.  

#### **Accessibility**  
- The building has a single staircase leading to the first floor; there is no accessible ramp or elevator within the structure. This could pose challenges for individuals with mobility impairments.

### **5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**  
1. **Outdated Electrical Panel:** Replace with a modern, energy-efficient panel to comply with current regulations.  
2. **Insulation Update:** Re-insulate exterior walls using high-performance insulation materials to improve thermal performance and reduce energy loss.  
3. **Alarm System Modernization:** Upgrade the fire alarm system to include more sensitive sensors and better communication protocols.  
4. **Accessibility Improvements:** Install ramps or an elevator at the entrance to enhance accessibility for all users.  

---

### **6. Compliance Summary**  
The building complies with current Finnish construction codes in terms of structural integrity, fire safety, and basic energy efficiency. However, it is noted that the building does not meet updated standards related to energy performance and modern fire safety systems. Recommendations have been provided to address these gaps.  

---

### **7. Conclusion**  
The industrial building in question has a generally good condition but requires updates to its electrical systems, insulation, and accessibility features to align with current building codes and improve functionality. The inspection report recommends specific upgrades to ensure the building remains safe, efficient, and usable for future occupancy.
