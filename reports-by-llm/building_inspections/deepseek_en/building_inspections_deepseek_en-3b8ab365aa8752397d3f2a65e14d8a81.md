### **4. Observations and Findings**  

#### **Structural Integrity**  
- The building appears structurally sound, with no immediate signs of collapse or instability. However, there are slight signs of settlement in the roof structure, likely due to the building's age (1999 construction).  

#### **Electrical Systems**  
- The electrical panel is outdated and requires modernization to meet current Finnish electrical codes.  

#### **Water and sewer systems**  
- There is a minor water leakage detected near the foundation, which may be related to aging pipes or a weak connection in the water supply system.  

#### **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC)**  
- The HVAC system operates efficiently but shows signs of wear and tear. It is recommended to replace or upgrade the equipment within the next five years to improve energy efficiency and reduce operational costs.  

#### **Fire Safety**  
- The fire safety systems are functional but outdated. Updates are required to comply with modern building regulations.  

#### **Accessibility**  
- The workshop has limited access for maintenance and repairs due to uneven flooring and restricted doorways, which could pose challenges for regular users.

### **5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**  

| **Issue**                     | **Details**                                                                 | **Recommendation**                                                                 |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------:|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| Roof Structure Settlement      | Slight settlement in the roof beams due to age.                               | Replace steel roof beams every 10 years as per Finnish building codes.               |
| Outdated Electrical Panel       | Electrical panel is outdated and requires modernization.                      | Upgrade electrical panel with a modern system compliant with current regulations.   |
| Minor Water Leakage            | Slight water leakage near the foundation, likely due to aging pipes.          | Replace or repair the leaking pipe within 12 months.                                |
| Outdated HVAC System           | HVAC operates efficiently but shows signs of wear and tear.                   | Replace or upgrade HVAC system within 5 years to improve energy efficiency.         |
| Outdated Fire Safety Systems   | Fire safety systems are functional but require updates.                        | Update fire safety systems with modern technology compliant with Finnish regulations.|
| Uneven Flooring               | Uneven flooring in the workshop, which could hinder regular access.             | Modify the flooring to ensure evenness and accessibility for maintenance personnel.  |

### **6. Compliance Summary**  
The building generally complies with local Finnish building regulations but requires several updates to fully meet modern standards. The identified issues are categorized as moderate priority based on their impact on the building's functionality, safety, and long-term sustainability.

---

### **7. Conclusion**  
The industrial workshop is in good overall condition, with no structural failures that could compromise its integrity. However, it requires several updates to improve its compliance with current building codes and enhance its operational efficiency. Immediate action should be taken on the outdated HVAC system and fire safety systems, while the roof beams can be replaced within the next decade as per recommendations.

**Follow-up Recommendation:**  
- Conduct a full structural inspection of the roof to assess the extent of settlement and ensure compliance with Finnish building standards.  
- Schedule an appointment with a professional engineer to evaluate the HVAC and water leakage issues for immediate fixes or further assessment.
