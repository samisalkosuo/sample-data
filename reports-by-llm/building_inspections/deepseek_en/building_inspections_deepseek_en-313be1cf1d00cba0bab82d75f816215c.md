### **4. Observations and Findings**  

#### **Structural Integrity**  
- The building appears structurally sound, with no visible signs of foundation settlement or major frame damage. However, there are minor wear and tear on the beams in the second floor area due to consistent use over the years.  

#### **Electrical Systems**  
- The electrical panel is operational but shows signs of inefficiency. Two outdated circuit breakers need to be replaced to improve energy efficiency.  

#### **Plumbing Systems**  
- The plumbing system functions well, with no visible leaks or clogs in the main areas. However, a minor water leak was detected near the toilet in one of the offices, likely due to old pipe connectors.  

#### **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC)**  
- The HVAC system is functional but shows signs of inefficiency. The ductwork has visible stains from years of moisture, and there are minor cracks in the insulation panels that could impact energy performance.  

#### **Fire Safety**  
- The fire safety systems appear to be operational and in good working order. Fire extinguishers are present and functional, with no visible damage to the fire suppression panels.  

#### **Accessibility**  
- The building has basic accessibility features, including a single staircase leading to the second floor. However, the stairs are narrow and could pose a safety hazard for individuals with mobility issues. Additionally, one of the exits lacks an emergency exit sign, raising concerns about compliance with Finnish building codes.

### **5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**  
1. **Structural Integrity:**  
   - Replacement of minor-scrattered beams in the second floor area to prevent further wear over time.  
   - Regular structural inspections every 3 years to ensure long-term stability.  

2. **Electrical Systems:**  
   - Replacement of outdated circuit breakers to improve energy efficiency and safety.  
   - Annual maintenance checks for all electrical components.  

3. **Plumbing Systems:**  
   - Immediate repair or replacement of the water leak near the toilet in one office unit.  
   - Regular inspections of pipe connectors and taps to prevent future leaks.  

4. **HVAC System:**  
   - Upgrading the HVAC system to improve energy efficiency and reduce operational costs.  
   - Annual maintenance checks for all HVAC components, including ductwork and insulation panels.  

5. **Fire Safety:**  
   - No immediate action required unless additional safety risks are identified during future inspections.  

6. **Accessibility:**  
   - Widening the stairs to ensure they meet Finnish accessibility standards.  
   - Adding emergency exit signs in all exits as per building codes.

### **6. Compliance Summary**  
The inspection report indicates that the commercial building generally complies with local and national building regulations, but there are areas where improvements can be made to enhance safety, efficiency, and accessibility. The findings align with Finnish building codes, particularly in terms of structural integrity, electrical systems, and fire safety.  

---

### **7. Conclusion**  
The Valmari Business Park is in good overall condition, with no major safety concerns or non-compliance issues. However, minor maintenance and upgrades are recommended to ensure long-term functionality and compliance with building codes. Follow-up inspections in 2025 will be conducted to verify the effectiveness of any proposed fixes.
