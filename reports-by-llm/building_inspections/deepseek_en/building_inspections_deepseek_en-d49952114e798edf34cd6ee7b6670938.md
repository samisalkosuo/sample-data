### **4. Observations and Findings**  
- **Structural Integrity:** The steel frame appears structurally sound, with no signs of major变形 or instability. However, there are minor signs of wear on the exterior surface plates due to years of exposure to environmental factors.  
- **Electrical Systems:** The electrical panel is outdated and requires modernization to comply with current Finnish electrical codes. There are no immediate safety hazards but could pose risks in the long term if not updated.  
- **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC):** The HVAC system operates efficiently during the inspection period but shows signs of wear on the outdoor unit components. Annual maintenance is recommended to ensure optimal performance.  
- **Fire Safety:** The fire alarm system was tested during the inspection and functions correctly. Fire extinguishers are maintained in good condition, and emergency exits comply with regulations.  
- **Accessibility:** The facility has adequate access for maintenance and emergency services but lacks a dedicated disabled access point on the ground floor. Minor adjustments could improve inclusivity.
