### **4. Observations and Findings**  

#### **Structural Integrity**  
- The building appears structurally sound, with no visible signs of foundation settlement or major beam degradation. However, some beams show signs of wear consistent with their age (2011 construction).  

#### **Electrical Systems**  
- The electrical wiring is in good condition, but there are concerns about outdated circuit breakers and insufficient circuit protection for modern appliances.  

#### **Plumbing Systems**  
- The plumbing system appears functional, but there are signs of mildew growth on the walls due to inadequate ventilation and poor drainage system design.  

#### **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC)**  
- The HVAC system is operational and energy-efficient, though it lacks modern controls and sensors for better monitoring and management.  

#### **Fire Safety**  
- Fire extinguishers are present but not in working order. The fire safety rating of the building does not meet updated national standards due to outdated construction materials.  

#### **Accessibility**  
- The property has basic accessibility features, including a staircase with handrails and a small ramp for wheelchairs. However, the ramp is narrow and lacks sufficient lighting for safe navigation during low-light conditions.

### **6. Compliance Summary**  
The building complies with current Finnish construction regulations for structural integrity, electrical systems, and basic fire safety measures. However, it does not fully comply with updated national standards related to plumbing efficiency, HVAC technology, and accessibility features. Immediate action is required to address the identified deficiencies.

---

### **7. Conclusion**  
The property is in good overall condition but requires attention to modernize outdated systems for compliance with current building codes. The findings are actionable, and prompt implementation of recommendations will ensure long-term occupancy safety and comfort.
