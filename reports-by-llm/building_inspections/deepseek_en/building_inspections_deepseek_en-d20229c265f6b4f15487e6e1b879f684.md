### **3. Inspection Context**

The inspection was conducted on 28 March 2025, during a mild spring day in Raisio. The weather conditions were partly cloudy with light rain, which could affect the structural integrity of sloped roofs and exterior surfaces.

The purpose of this inspection was to evaluate the overall condition of the residential building as part of routine maintenance checks for potential resale or future renovations.

### **4. Observations and Findings**

#### **Structural Integrity**
- The building appears structurally sound with no visible signs of immediate collapse or damage.
- The brickwork is intact, but there are signs of cavity wall degradation in the basement area due to age.

#### **Electrical System**
- The electrical wiring is outdated and requires modernization. The last inspection noted that the circuit breakers need replacement for safety reasons.

#### **Plumbing System**
- The plumbing system appears functional, but the pipes in the basement are rusted through in several places. Repiping is recommended to extend the building's lifespan.

#### **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) System**
- The HVAC system is operational but inefficient due to outdated equipment. Upgrading the system is necessary for energy efficiency and compliance with current regulations.

#### **Fire Safety**
- The smoke detectors are functional, but the emergency exit signs in the kitchen area are non-functional. Repainting of the signs is recommended.

#### **Accessibility**
- The building has a staircase that does not meet accessibility standards. A ramp installation is required to comply with Finnish accessibility laws.
