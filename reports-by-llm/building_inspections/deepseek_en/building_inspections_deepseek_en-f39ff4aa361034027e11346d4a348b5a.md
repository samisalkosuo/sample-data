- **Primary Materials:** Steel beams, reinforced concrete walls, and steel frames with insulation panels  

---

### **3. Inspection Context**  
The inspection was conducted on 14 January 2025 during the coldest days of winter in Finland. The weather conditions were extremely cold, with temperatures below freezing, which posed challenges for accessing outdoor areas for inspections. The purpose of this inspection was to ensure compliance with current Finnish building regulations and to assess the structural integrity and safety of the facility as it relates to its intended use ( industrial operations).

### **4. Observations and Findings**  
- **Structural Integrity:**  
  - The steel beams supporting the second floor appear to be in good condition, but there are signs of fatigue at several joints. Two of the beams require immediate replacement due to structural weakness.  
  - The foundation has minor cracks that do not compromise stability but should be addressed for long-term durability.  

- **Electrical Systems:**  
  - The electrical wiring is outdated and requires modernization to meet current Finnish safety standards. Several receptacles are overloaded, posing a risk of fire if overloaded further.  

- **Plumbing Systems:**  
  - The plumbing system has visible rust on several pipes, indicating corrosion from years of exposure to moisture and cold temperatures. A partial blockage in one of the water lines was identified but appears to be manageable with proper cleaning.  

- **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC):**  
  - The HVAC system is operational but shows signs of inefficiency. Energy consumption could be reduced by upgrading the heating and cooling units to more energy-efficient models.  

- **Fire Safety:**  
  - The fire safety insulation in the walls is outdated and does not meet modern Finnish standards. Additional insulation is required for better thermal protection against cold weather.  

- **Accessibility:**  
  - The facility has limited access for maintenance personnel, especially during colder months. A dedicated maintenance entrance with better lighting and door clearance would improve accessibility.

### **5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**  
1. **Structural Integrity:**  
   - Replace the two critically weakened steel beams ( recommending a replacement within six months).  
   - Repair minor foundation cracks using appropriate materials to ensure long-term stability.  

2. **Electrical Systems:**  
   - Modernize the electrical wiring to meet current Finnish safety standards, including upgrading receptacles and installing circuit breakers.  
   - Conduct a full inspection of all electrical systems to identify additional issues ( recommending a comprehensive report within two weeks).  

3. **Plumbing Systems:**  
   - Treat the rust on pipes with protective coatings or replace them as needed.  
   - Clear the partial blockage in the water line immediately to prevent further issues.  

4. **HVAC System:**  
   - Upgrade the HVAC units to more energy-efficient models ( recommending a replacement within six months).  
   - Conduct an energy audit to identify additional inefficiencies and implement cost-saving measures.  

5. **Fire Safety:**  
   - Replace the outdated fire safety insulation in walls with modern materials that meet current standards.  
   - Ensure all exits are clearly marked and accessible for maintenance personnel, especially during colder months.

### **6. Compliance Summary**  
The building does not fully comply with current Finnish building regulations due to several non-compliance points identified during the inspection. However, most issues can be resolved through routine maintenance and minor repairs without significant overhauls. The facility is in good overall condition but requires attention to modernize its electrical and HVAC systems, improve fire safety measures, and enhance accessibility for maintenance operations.  

---

### **7. Conclusion**  
The Industrial Building "TechPark II" in Aura has been assessed as being in satisfactory overall condition, with minor issues that can be addressed through routine maintenance and upgrades. The facility is safe for its intended use but requires attention to modernize certain systems and improve accessibility. Follow-up inspections are recommended within six months to ensure compliance with updated building codes and standards.
