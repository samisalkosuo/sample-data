---

### **3. Inspection Context**

### **4. Observations and Findings**  

#### **Structural Integrity**  
- The building appears structurally sound, with no visible cracks or openings in the foundation or walls. However, there are signs of subsidence along the south-facing facade, likely due to differential settling from the construction era.  

#### **Electrical System**  
- The electrical wiring is intact and functional, but outdated circuit breakers and switches are present. No significant issues were observed during the inspection.  

#### **Plumbing System**  
- The plumbing system appears to be in good working order. However, the pipes in the bathrooms show signs of mildew due to inadequate ventilation and poor insulation around water pipes.  

#### **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC)**  
- The HVAC system is operational but shows signs of inefficiency. The ductwork is outdated, and there are frequent drafts observed during inspections.  

#### **Fire Safety**  
- The fire extinguisher is functional and in good condition. Fire safety labels on the windows are legible, but emergency exits lack visible signage.  

#### **Accessibility**  
- The building has a sloped garden at the rear, which poses difficulty for individuals with mobility challenges. Additionally, the staircase leading to the second floor is narrow and lacks handrails.

### **5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**  

| **Issue**                          | **Recommendation**                                                                 |
|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Subsidence along the south-facing facade | Leveling of the foundation using reinforced concrete slabs or geotextile membranes. |
| Mildew in plumbing due to poor insulation | Replacement of old pipes with insulated PEX or PVC pipe and improved ventilation.    |
| Outdated HVAC system                 | Upgrade to a modern, energy-efficient HVAC unit with better ductwork and controls.  |
| Absence of fire safety signage          | Installation of visible emergency exit signs on all floors and proper fire extinguisher placement. |
| Narrow staircase without handrails   | Modernization of the staircase with additional handrails and possibly widened treads. |

### **6. Compliance Summary**  
The building partially complies with current Finnish building regulations but requires modernization to meet updated standards for structural integrity, insulation efficiency, and accessibility. The primary deficiencies are related to outdated materials and systems that no longer meet modern safety and performance criteria.

---

### **7. Conclusion**  
The residential building in Kalajoki, constructed in 1981, is in satisfactory overall condition but requires several modernization steps to ensure long-term occupancy and compliance with contemporary building codes. The identified issues are actionable and should be addressed promptly to prevent further deterioration or safety hazards.
