### **4. Observations and Findings**  
- **Structural Integrity:** The building appears structurally sound, but there are signs of wear and tear consistent with its age (1977). The brick masonry shows light peeling on the exterior walls in areas exposed to moisture from adjacent buildings.  
- **Electrical System:** The electrical wiring is outdated, necessitating modernization to meet current Finnish building codes. The system operates efficiently but lacks proper circuit protection for high-power appliances.  
- **Plumbing System:** The plumbing appears functional but requires modernization to comply with节水 regulations. Older pipes and fixtures are prone to blockages.  
- **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC):** The HVAC system is operational but inefficient, requiring upgrading to improve energy efficiency and reduce utility costs.  
- **Fire Safety:** The building lacks adequate fire safety measures, including smoke detectors in all common areas and fire extinguishers in the electrical room. Fire exits are functional but could benefit from additional signage for better visibility during emergencies.  
- **Accessibility:** The stairs leading to the second floor are narrow and uneven, posing a risk of injury. The lighting in the hallway is insufficient for safe navigation at night.
