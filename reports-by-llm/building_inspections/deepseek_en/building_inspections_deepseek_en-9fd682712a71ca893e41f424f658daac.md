### **4. Observations and Findings**  
- **Structural Integrity:** The house appears structurally sound with no visible cracks or warping in the wooden frames. However, the foundation shows signs of subsidence due to differential settling over the years.  
- **Electrical System:** The electrical wiring is outdated and does not comply with current Finnish building regulations. There are several loose connections that could pose safety hazards if left unaddressed.  
- **Plumbing System:** The plumbing system appears functional but has inefficiencies, particularly in water flow through the radiators. There are also a few minor leaks in the pipes near the foundation.  
- **Heating and Cooling (HVAC):** The central heating system is operational but less efficient than modern standards. The cooling system is functional but shows signs of wear and tear on the outdoor units.  
- **Fire Safety:** The house has outdated smoke detectors installed, which may not meet current Finnish fire safety regulations. Fire extinguishers are present but not tested in accordance with the latest standards.  
- **Accessibility:** The driveway has a slight slope that makes it difficult for older vehicles to access during winter months. There is also a lack of handrails on the staircase leading to the second floor, posing a minor safety hazard.
