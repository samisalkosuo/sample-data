### **3. Inspection Context**

The inspection was conducted on 28 December 2024 during the coldest part of winter in Finland. The weather conditions were snowy and icy, with temperatures below freezing throughout the day. The purpose of this inspection was to conduct a routine structural check of the residential building as part of the annual maintenance program for older buildings.

### **4. Observations and Findings**

#### **Structural Integrity**  
- The building appears structurally sound overall, with no signs of immediate collapse or instability. However, there are some signs of wear and tear consistent with a 20-year-old residential structure in Finland's climate.

#### **Electrical System**  
- The wiring system is outdated and requires modernization to comply with current Finnish electrical codes. There are visible signs of corrosion on the electrical components, particularly in the distribution panel.

#### **Water and Sewage Systems**  
- The water pipes show signs of pitting due to age, which could potentially lead to leaks if not addressed. The sewage system appears functional but requires regular maintenance to prevent future issues.

#### **Heating System**  
- The central heating system is operational but shows signs of inefficiency. The radiators are old and require replacement to improve heat distribution and efficiency.

#### **Fire Safety**  
- The fire safety measures in the building are outdated. The smoke detectors are non-functional, and there are insufficient fire extinguishers installed according to Finnish regulations.

#### **Accessibility**  
- The building has basic accessibility features but lacks a staircase-tolevator conversion, which could pose challenges for older residents or those with mobility issues.

### **5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

| **Issue**                                                                 | **Recommendation**                                                                 |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Outdated electrical wiring and components                                      | Upgrade the electrical system to meet current Finnish building codes.               |
| Pitted water pipes that could lead to leaks                                     | Replace the pitted water pipes with modern, corrosion-resistant materials.          |
| Inefficient central heating system                                              | Replace the old radiators and upgrade the heating system for better efficiency.     |
| Non-functional smoke detectors                                                 | Install new, compliant smoke detectors in all living areas.                       |
| Insufficient fire extinguishers                                               | Install a sufficient number of fire extinguishers according to Finnish regulations.|
| Lack of staircase-to-elevator conversion                                       | Convert one staircase to an elevator for improved accessibility.                  |
