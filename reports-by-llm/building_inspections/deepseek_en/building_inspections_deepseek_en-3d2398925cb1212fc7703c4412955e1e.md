### **4. Observations and Findings**  

#### **Structural Integrity**  
- The building appears structurally sound with no immediate signs of foundation collapse or major frame issues. However, outdated insulation in certain areas (approximately 20% of the building) leads to cold spots during colder months.  

#### **Electrical Systems**  
- The electrical wiring is in good condition, but there are signs of wear and tear on the circuit breakers and switches. No immediate safety hazards were observed, but updates may be recommended for future-proofing.  

#### **Plumbing Systems**  
- The plumbing system appears functional, but there are minor leaks at the baseboards in two apartments. These are likely due to outdated pipe materials and insufficient sealing.  

#### **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC)**  
- The HVAC system is operational but less efficient than modern standards. Energy loss is moderate, and there is room for improvement in terms of efficiency and insulation.  

#### **Fire Safety**  
- Fire extinguishers are present and functional, but the fire extinguisher rating (Class B) does not meet current Finnish building codes, which recommend a Class C or higher.  

#### **Accessibility**  
- The building has basic accessibility features, including a staircase with handrails and a small elevator. However, the door width is narrow for individuals with mobility challenges, and there are no elevators in the exterior areas.

### **5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**  

| **Issue**                                      | **Details**                                                                 | **Recommendation**                                                                 |
|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Outdated Insulation                           | 20% of the building has outdated insulation, leading to cold spots.           | Replace or upgrade insulation in affected areas within 6 months.                  |
| Outdated Electrical Wiring                      | Circuit breakers and switches show signs of wear.                            | Update wiring and components as per current codes within 3 months.                |
| Plumbing Leaks                                  | Minor leaks at the baseboards in two apartments.                           | Replace leaking pipes and install proper sealing materials immediately.            |
| Inefficient HVAC System                         | Current system is less efficient than modern standards.                     | Upgrade HVAC system to meet energy efficiency standards within 6 months.          |
| Fire Safety Concerns                           | Fire extinguisher rating does not meet current codes.                        | Upgrade fire extinguishers to Class C or higher immediately.                     |
| Narrow Door Width                              | Door width is narrow for individuals with mobility challenges.              | Install a wider door (at least 80 cm wide) and ensure it meets accessibility standards. |

### **6. Compliance Summary**  
The building generally complies with local Finnish building regulations, but several areas require improvement to meet current codes:  

- **Structural Integrity:** Fully compliant.  
- **Electrical Systems:** Needs minor updates but no immediate safety risks.  
- **Plumbing Systems:** Shows signs of wear and tear; requires maintenance.  
- **HVAC System:** Inefficient compared to modern standards, requiring upgrade.  
- **Fire Safety:** Non-compliant due to outdated fire extinguishers.  
- **Accessibility:** Partially compliant with basic features but lacking in inclusivity.  

A detailed report has been prepared to address the identified issues and ensure compliance with updated building codes.

### **7. Conclusion**  
The overall condition of the building is satisfactory, with minor issues that can be addressed without significant structural compromise. The building appears safe for occupancy but requires timely maintenance to fully comply with current regulations. No urgent follow-up actions are required at this time, as most issues can be resolved within the next three months.
