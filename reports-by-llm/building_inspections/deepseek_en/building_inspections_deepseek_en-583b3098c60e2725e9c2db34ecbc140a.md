### **4. Observations and Findings**  

#### **Structural Integrity**  
- The wooden beams supporting the second floor were overdue for maintenance and exhibited signs of warping due to moisture damage from subfloor insulation.  
- The metal frame was in good condition but required annual inspection for load-bearing capacity over 45 years.  

#### **Electrical System**  
- The wiring was outdated, with several components nearing their lifespan (e.g., circuit breakers).  
- The electrical panel lacked proper surge protection and needed to be upgraded to meet current standards.  

#### **Plumbing System**  
- The pipes in the water supply system were corroded due to prolonged exposure to freezing temperatures during winter. Replacement was recommended for sections over 10 years old.  
- The drainage system had a partial blockage, requiring immediate attention to prevent future flooding issues.  

#### **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC)**  
- The HVAC unit required annual maintenance and inspection due to its age. It also lacked energy-efficient controls, necessitating an upgrade to meet current energy standards.  

#### **Fire Safety**  
- The building's fire safety system was outdated, with walls constructed from materials that could flammable in case of accidental ignition. Modernized systems were recommended for enhanced protection.  

#### **Accessibility**  
- The stairs leading to the second floor required modernization to comply with Finnish accessibility standards (e.g., wider steps and handrails).

| **Issue**                                                                 | **Recommendation**                                                                 |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Outdated wooden beams in the second floor (<10 years old)                 | Replace beams with modern-grade wood or consider alternative structural solutions. |
| Overlapping electrical wiring                                                   | Upgrade circuit breakers and rewiring to meet current standards.                  |
| Corroded plumbing pipes (over 10 years old)                              | Replace affected pipes with high-quality materials.                                |
| Partial blockage in the drainage system                                    | Clear the blockage immediately to prevent future flooding issues.                 |
| Outdated HVAC unit and controls                                               | Upgrade the system to meet energy efficiency standards.                          |
| Flammable fire safety walls                                                 | Modernize the walls with non-flammable materials or install additional fire barriers.
| Stairs requiring modernization                                              | Update staircases to comply with Finnish accessibility standards.                |

### **6. Compliance Summary**  
The building appears to be in good overall condition, with no major structural failures that would compromise safety. However, several components are nearing their lifespan and require modernization or replacement to ensure compliance with current Finnish building regulations. The HVAC system is operational but requires routine maintenance, while the fire safety measures are adequate for the current year but should be updated periodically.

### **7. Conclusion**  
The commercial building in Petäjävesi, Finland, has been inspected and found to be structurally sound with no immediate safety risks. However, several components require attention to ensure long-term compliance with building regulations. Immediate action is recommended for the electrical wiring, plumbing system, HVAC unit, and accessibility upgrades. Regular maintenance should be scheduled for all systems to prevent future issues.
