### **4. Observations and Findings**  

#### **Structural Integrity**  
The building appears structurally sound with no visible signs of major damage or instability. However, there are minor signs of wear on the foundation stones due to consistent load distribution over the years.

#### **Electrical System**  
- The electrical system is functional but shows signs of inefficiency in terms of energy consumption and outdated wiring. There are no immediate safety concerns, but regular maintenance is recommended.

#### **Plumbing System**  
- The plumbing system operates efficiently under normal conditions. However, there are minor leaks detected in the water supply lines near the service entrance. These appear to be caused by aging pipe connections that require replacement.

#### **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC)**  
- The HVAC system is operational but inefficient due to outdated equipment and insufficient insulation. This contributes to higher energy consumption during peak periods.

#### **Fire Safety**  
- The fire safety systems are functional and meet current regulations. Fire extinguishers are properly maintained, and emergency exits are adequately lit and free of obstructions.

#### **Accessibility**  
- The building has limited accessibility features for individuals with mobility challenges. Steps at the entrance are uneven, and there is no elevator or ramps to accommodate users with physical disabilities.

### **5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**  

| **Issue**                          | **Details**                                                                 | **Recommendation**                                                                 |
|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------:|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| **Electrical System**               | Inefficient wiring and outdated components.                                  | Upgrade the electrical system to modern standards with energy-efficient equipment. |
| **Plumbing System**                | Minor leaks in water supply lines near the service entrance.                  | Replace the affected pipe connections and repair leaks.                            |
| **HVAC System**                     | Inefficient operation due to outdated equipment and insufficient insulation.| Upgrade HVAC system components, including air conditioning units and insulation.  |
| **Fire Safety Systems**            | Fire extinguishers are maintained but could benefit from additional training.| Conduct regular fire safety drills and ensure all systems are fully functional.    |
| **Accessibility**                   | Limited access for individuals with mobility challenges due to uneven steps.   | Install ramps, an elevator, or grab bars at the entrance to improve accessibility. |

### **6. Compliance Summary**  
The building complies partially with current Finnish building regulations. While it meets basic standards for structural integrity and fire safety, there are areas where improvements can enhance compliance with modern building codes.

---

### **7. Conclusion**  
The building in Perho is structurally sound but requires attention to optimize energy efficiency, upgrade electrical and plumbing systems, and improve accessibility features. A follow-up inspection is recommended within six months to ensure all recommended actions are completed.
