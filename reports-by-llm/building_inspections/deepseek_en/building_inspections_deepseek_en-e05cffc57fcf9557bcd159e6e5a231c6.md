### **4. Observations and Findings**  
- **Structural Integrity:**  
  - The building appears structurally sound, with no visible signs of foundation settlement or major frame issues.  

- **Electrical Systems:**  
  - The electrical panel is operational but shows signs of wear on the wiring connections. Regular maintenance is recommended to prevent future issues.  

- **Plumbing Systems:**  
  - The plumbing system functions adequately, though there are visible stains on the pipes due to years of moisture accumulation. These are likely from rainwater infiltration and should be addressed promptly.  

- **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC):**  
  - The HVAC system operates efficiently but shows signs of inefficiency in energy usage. Upgrading to a more energy-efficient system is recommended to reduce utility costs and environmental impact.  

- **Fire Safety:**  
  - Fire extinguishers are present and functional, but the emergency exit signage requires updating for clarity and compliance with current regulations.  

- **Accessibility:**  
  - The building has one staircase leading to the second floor, which may be challenging for individuals with mobility issues. A ramp installation is recommended to improve accessibility standards.

### **5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**  
1. **Moisture Damage:**  
   - Visible stains on plumbing pipes due to rainwater infiltration.  
   - **Recommendation:** Conduct a full inspection of the building envelope to identify and address water ingress points.  

2. **Electrical Systems:**  
   - Worn wiring connections in the electrical panel.  
   - **Recommendation:** Schedule professional rewiring to ensure long-term reliability and safety.  

3. **Energy Efficiency:**  
   - Inefficient HVAC system with high energy consumption.  
   - **Recommendation:** Upgrade to a more energy-efficient HVAC unit, adhering to current Finnish building standards.

   - Outdated emergency exit signage requiring updates.  
   - **Recommendation:** Revise the signage to comply with modern fire safety regulations and improve overall evacuation pathways.  

5. **Accessibility:**  
   - Single staircase leading to the second floor, posing accessibility challenges.  
   - **Recommendation:** Install a ramp at the staircase entrance to meet updated accessibility standards.

### **6. Compliance Summary**  
The building partially complies with current Finnish residential construction codes but requires updates in the following areas:  
- **Energy Efficiency:** The HVAC system exceeds energy performance limits set by recent regulations.  
- **Fire Safety:** The emergency exit signage is outdated and does not meet modern fire safety standards.  
- **Accessibility:** The staircase does not comply with updated accessibility guidelines.  

---

### **7. Conclusion**  
The residential building in question has overall good structural integrity but requires attention to energy efficiency, fire safety, and accessibility upgrades to fully align with current regulations. A follow-up inspection is recommended within six months to ensure compliance and address any identified issues promptly.
