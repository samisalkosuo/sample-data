### **3. Inspection Context**  
The inspection was conducted on 01 August 2024, during a mild summer day in Lapland. The temperature reached approximately 20°C, but light mist and rain fell throughout the morning due to the region's geographical characteristics. The purpose of this inspection was to evaluate the structural integrity and compliance with current Finnish building codes for an industrial property nearing 53 years of age.

### **4. Observations and Findings**  

#### **Structural Integrity**  
- The building appears structurally sound, with no visible signs of foundation collapse or major frame issues. However, the foundation exhibits uneven settlement over the north-facing wall, likely due to differential heating during construction in a cold climate.  

#### **Electrical System**  
- The electrical panel is outdated and requires modernization. Two of the three live circuits are non-compliant with current Finnish electrical regulations, necessitating an upgrade to a 2023-compliant circuit breaker system.  

#### **Plumbing System**  
- The plumbing system shows signs of wear and tear across all units. The water heater is 25 years old and requires replacement. Additionally, the drainage pipes in the basement are clogged due to accumulated snowwater from previous winters.  

#### **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC)**  
- The HVAC system operates efficiently but shows signs of inefficiency. The ductwork has visible rust and peeling paint, indicating potential exposure to moisture or neglect over the years. Modernization is recommended to improve energy efficiency.  

#### **Fire Safety**  
- Fire extinguishers are present in all common areas but are outdated and not properly maintained. A new fire extinguisher system with updated nozzles should be installed to comply with current regulations.  

#### **Accessibility**  
- The building has basic accessibility features, including a ramp at the entrance and grab bars in the bathrooms. However, the staircase lacks handrails on the upper floors, posing a safety hazard for older residents or individuals with mobility challenges.

| **Issue**                                      | **Recommendation**                                                                 |
|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Outdated electrical panel                       | Replace with a 2023-compliant circuit breaker system.                              |
| Non-compliant plumbing system                   | Replace the water heater (25 years old) and address clogged drainage pipes.          |
| Outdated HVAC system                            | Overhaul or replace the HVAC system to improve energy efficiency.                  |
| Outdated fire extinguishers                     | Replace with a modern, properly maintained fire extinguisher system.               |
| Basic accessibility features                   | Upgrade handrails on the staircase and ensure all staircases have safety railings.|
| Age-related structural wear (north-facing wall)  | Monitor for further foundation settlement and consider structural reinforcement if needed. |

### **6. Compliance Summary**  
The building does not currently comply with modern Finnish building codes due to its age and outdated systems. Key areas requiring attention include electrical, plumbing, HVAC, fire safety, and accessibility systems. Modernizing these components will ensure compliance with current regulations and enhance the building's safety and functionality.

---

### **7. Conclusion**  
The industrial building in Vesilahti is in satisfactory overall condition but requires several modernization efforts to meet current standards. Immediate action on the electrical panel, plumbing system, HVAC, fire safety, and accessibility upgrades is recommended. The building should be inspected again within 12 months following these modifications to ensure full compliance.
