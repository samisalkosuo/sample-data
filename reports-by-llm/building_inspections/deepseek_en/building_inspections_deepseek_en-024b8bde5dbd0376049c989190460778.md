### 4. Observations and Findings  

#### Structural Integrity  
- The steel beams exhibit signs of fatigue, particularly along the foundation, likely due to heavy machinery usage nearby.  
- There are minor cracks in the concrete foundation slab that could potentially affect load-bearing capacity if not addressed.  

#### Electrical Systems  
- The electrical wiring is outdated, with several components exceeding their recommended service life.  
- The circuit breakers and switches require replacement to ensure safety and efficiency.  

#### Plumbing Systems  
- The plumbing system shows signs of wear and tear on older pipes, particularly in the basement.  
- A few water heater elements are nearing the end of their operational lifespan.  

#### HVAC Systems  
- The heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems function adequately but require routine maintenance to optimize performance.  

#### Fire Safety  
- The smoke detectors are functional but not compliant with current regulations requiring additional fire extinguishers on each floor.  
- The fire extinguishers have expired their test dates and need replacement or recalibration.  

#### Accessibility  
- The building has narrow doorways and steps, which could pose accessibility challenges for individuals with mobility issues.

### 6. Compliance Summary  
The building complies with Finnish construction codes in terms of structural integrity, electrical systems, and HVAC functionality. However, several components require immediate attention to ensure long-term safety and efficiency. The current state of the fire safety and accessibility features is compliant but necessitates updates for full compliance.

---

### 7. Conclusion  
The Sottunga Industrial Estate building is structurally sound with minor issues that do not compromise its safety or stability. Routine maintenance, including updating electrical systems, fire extinguishers, and accessibility features, will ensure continued compliance with Finnish building regulations. Follow-up inspections are recommended to address identified issues proactively.
