### **5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

| **Issue**                     | **Details**                                                                 | **Recommendation**                                                                 |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------:|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| **Dampness in Walls**          | Visible moisture on the southern brick walls around window openings.       | Repairs to mitigate moisture, such as installing vapor barriers and moisture-stopping materials. |
| **Outdated Electrical Wiring**  | Wiring connections show signs of fatigue and require replacement.           | Upgrading the electrical wiring to modern standards for safety and efficiency.     |
| **Older Plumbing Fixtures**    | Outdated showerheads and taps that are inefficient and noisy.                | Replacement with energy-efficient fixtures to reduce water consumption.          |
| **Overheating in Ductwork**     | Slight overheating in the HVAC system, particularly during extreme heat.   | Insulation upgrade or maintenance of the ductwork for optimal performance.        |
| **Fire Safety Enhancements**   | Fire-rated doors are adequate but could benefit from additional smoke detectors.| Consider installing whole-building smoke detectors and reviewing fire extinguisher placement. |
| **Handrails in Staircases**    | Handrails are present but could be improved for safety during low-light conditions. | Upgrading the handrails to include illuminated or extra-wide options.             |

### **6. Compliance Summary**

The inspection identified several issues that fall under current Finnish building codes. While these issues do not violate modern regulations, they represent opportunities for improvement to enhance the property's long-term performance and safety.

---

### **7. Conclusion**

The residential building constructed in 1982 appears structurally sound but requires minor updates to address dampness, outdated electrical wiring, and plumbing fixtures. These repairs are recommended to ensure compliance with modern building standards while preserving the property's value and functionality.

**Follow-up Recommendation**: A full renovation or retrofitting may be warranted if significant structural changes are required in the near future.
