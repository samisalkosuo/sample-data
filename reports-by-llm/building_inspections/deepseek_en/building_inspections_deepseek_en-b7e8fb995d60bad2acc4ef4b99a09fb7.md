### **4. Observations and Findings**  

#### **Structural Integrity**  
- The building appears structurally sound with no visible signs of uplift or bowing. However, there are minor cracks in the brickwork along the foundation walls, likely due to thermal expansion over the years.  

#### **Electrical System**  
- The electrical wiring is outdated and requires modernization. There are insufficient circuit breakers for modern appliances, and the lighting system needs upgrading to energy-efficient LED fixtures.  

#### **Plumbing System**  
- The plumbing system appears functional but has visible water stains on the pipes around expansion joints. These are likely due to thermal stress from seasonal temperature changes.  

#### **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC)**  
- The HVAC system is operational and energy-efficient. Annual maintenance checks are recommended for optimal performance.  

#### **Fire Safety**  
- The fire extinguisher is functional but does not comply with current regulations. Additional fire detectors should be installed to meet modern safety standards.  

#### **Accessibility**  
- The building has a sloping entrance, which could pose accessibility challenges for individuals with mobility issues. A ramp or step lift modification is recommended.

### **6. Compliance Summary**  
The building does not fully comply with current Finnish building regulations due to outdated electrical wiring, non-compliant fire safety measures, and structural reinforcements required. However, it is structurally sound and could be brought up to standard with the recommended modifications.

---

### **7. Conclusion**  
The public building in Oripää (invented address) has a good overall condition but requires attention to modernize its electrical system, improve accessibility, and upgrade fire safety measures. Annual inspections should continue to ensure long-term stability and compliance with building codes.
