### **4. Observations and Findings**

#### **Structural Integrity**  
- The building appears structurally sound, with no visible signs of immediate collapse or instability. However, there are signs of age-related wear and tear, particularly in the wooden beams supporting the roof and floors.  

#### **Electrical Systems**  
- The electrical wiring is functional but shows signs of wear and tear. There are no major safety concerns, but the system could benefit from an updated circuit breaker panel to comply with current Finnish standards.  

#### **Plumbing Systems**  
- The plumbing appears to function adequately for residential use. However, there are minor leaks in the pipes under the kitchen sink that may require attention to prevent water damage over time.  

#### **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC)**  
- The HVAC system is operational but shows signs of age. It requires regular maintenance to ensure optimal performance during colder months.  

#### **Fire Safety**  
- The building complies with outdated fire safety regulations due to its construction date. The insulation panels in the attic are older and may not provide adequate protection against heat release in case of a fire. Additionally, there is an outdated smoke detector system installed on the first floor that does not meet modern standards.  

#### **Accessibility**  
- The property has two stairs leading to the second floor, which could pose a risk for individuals with mobility challenges. There are no ramps or elevators available for access to the upper floors.
