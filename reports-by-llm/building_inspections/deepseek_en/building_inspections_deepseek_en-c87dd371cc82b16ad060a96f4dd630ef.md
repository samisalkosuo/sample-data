### **4. Observations and Findings**  

#### **Structural Integrity**  
- The building appears structurally sound, with no visible signs of foundation settlement or major frame damage. However, there are minor cracks in the concrete slabs at the second and third floors, likely due to thermal expansion over the years.

#### **Electrical Systems**  
- The electrical panel is outdated and requires modernization. There are several receptacles without proper circuit breakers, and the lighting fixtures are inefficient, consuming more energy than recommended for modern standards.

#### **Plumbing Systems**  
- The plumbing system shows signs of wear and tear. The water supply pipes exhibit light rust in several joints, likely from decades of use. The drainage system is functioning adequately but could benefit from a partial renovation to improve efficiency.

#### **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC)**  
- The HVAC units are functional but require regular maintenance. There are signs of condensation on the outer surfaces of the windows, indicating poor insulation or moisture control issues.

#### **Fire Safety**  
- The fire extinguishers are functional but not up to modern safety standards. A full fire safety inspection is recommended to ensure compliance with current regulations.

#### **Accessibility**  
- The building has basic accessibility features, such as a single staircase and interior ramps for wheelchair access. However, the elevator is outdated and requires significant upgrades to meet current accessibility standards.

### **6. Compliance Summary**  
The building complies with local Finnish construction regulations for commercial structures built in 1974 but requires updates to address outdated systems and materials. The inspection report does not identify any major safety concerns, but several moderate issues fall outside of the current compliance standards.

---

### **7. Conclusion**  
The inspected commercial building is structurally sound and functional but requires minor renovations to modernize its electrical, plumbing, HVAC, and fire safety systems. The overall condition is satisfactory for routine use but does not warrant immediate intervention unless additional structural concerns are identified in the future.
