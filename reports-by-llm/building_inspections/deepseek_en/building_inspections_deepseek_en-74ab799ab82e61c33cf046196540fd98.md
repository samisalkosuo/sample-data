- **Number of Floors:** 3  
- **Primary Materials:** Steel frame with concrete and brick walls, metal roofing, thermal insulation in the form of rigid foam panels  

---

### **3. Inspection Context**  
The inspection was conducted on 10 November 2024 at Finström Industrial Plant, located at P.O. Box 123. The weather conditions were mild for Lapland, with temperatures averaging -8°C and light snowfall of 2 cm. The inspection was a routine structural check to ensure compliance with local building regulations before potential resale or expansion.

### **4. Observations and Findings**  

#### **Structural Integrity:**  
- The steel beams supporting the factory roof require minor reinforcement due to fatigue from repeated loading over the years.  
- The foundation has minor cracks in the concrete slab, likely caused by differential settling during construction.  

#### **Electrical Systems:**  
- The wiring system is outdated and requires modernization to meet current Finnish electrical codes.  
- The lighting fixtures are functional but lack energy-efficient LED replacements.  

#### **Plumbing Systems:**  
- The water heater is operational but shows signs of wear and tear, necessitating a replacement within the next 3 years.  
- The drainage system appears to function adequately, with no visible leaks or clogs.  

#### **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC):**  
- The HVAC system is functional but lacks energy efficiency ratings. Upgrading to a modern system would reduce operational costs by 20% over the next decade.  

#### **Fire Safety:**  
- The fire extinguisher system is functional but outdated in design. Modernizing it with automatic suppression systems is recommended.  

#### **Accessibility:**  
- The facility has limited access for wheelchairs due to the slope of the roof and steps leading to the foundation. A ramp installation is required within 6 months.

### **5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**  

| **Issue**                                | **Recommendation**                                                                 |
|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Steel beams require minor reinforcement      | Replace affected beams with modern steel sections (e.g., W-sections)               |
| Foundation cracks in concrete slab          | Repair using high-strength concrete or injecting grout for stabilization           |
| Outdated electrical wiring                 | Upgrade to meet Finnish electrical codes and install LED lighting                |
| Water heater nearing end of life          | Replace with a high-efficiency model to reduce energy consumption                  |
| HVAC system requires modernization         | Upgrade to an energy-efficient system with better insulation                      |
| Fire extinguisher system is outdated      | Modernize with automatic fire suppression systems                              |
| Limited wheelchair access                   | Install a ramp at the foundation entrance within 6 months                       |

### **6. Compliance Summary**  
The building complies with Finnish construction codes and regulations, albeit with minor deficiencies in structural components and electrical systems. The primary issues identified are actionable and can be resolved without compromising the overall structural integrity of the facility.

---

### **7. Conclusion**  
Finström Industrial Plant is in good overall condition for an industrial structure of its age. Minor updates to its systems will ensure long-term compliance with building regulations and operational efficiency. A follow-up inspection within 12 months is recommended to monitor any progression of structural issues, particularly the steel beams and electrical wiring.
