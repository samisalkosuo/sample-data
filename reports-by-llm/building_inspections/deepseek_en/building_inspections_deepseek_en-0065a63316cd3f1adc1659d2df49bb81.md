### **3. Inspection Context**

The inspection was conducted on 13.06.2025 during a partly cloudy day in Hankasalmi, Finland. The temperature was mild, with a slight above-freezing overnight low expected due to the season. The weather conditions were ideal for visual inspections but resulted in minimal moisture accumulation, which could impact certain exterior surfaces.

The purpose of this inspection was to evaluate the structural integrity and compliance with local building regulations as outlined by the Finnish Building Authority (Valitut rakennusohjeet).

### **4. Observations and Findings**

#### **Structural Integrity**  
- The building appears structurally sound, with no visible signs of major foundation issues or lateral deflection under normal load conditions.

#### **Electrical Systems**  
- The electrical wiring is in good condition but nearing its design life limit due to the number of years since its installation. Regular maintenance should be scheduled for this system.

#### **Water and sewer systems**  
- The water supply system functions adequately, with no visible leaks or standing water around the building. However, the sewer lines are showing signs of fatigue, which may require replacement within the next 10 years.

#### **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC)**  
- The HVAC system operates efficiently but shows signs of wear on the outdoor unit fins. Regular maintenance is recommended to ensure optimal performance and energy efficiency.

#### **Fire Safety**  
- The fire safety systems are functional and in good working condition. Fire extinguishers are available at all exits, and emergency lighting is operational.

#### **Accessibility**  
- The building has basic accessibility features, including a ramp for wheelchairs and grab bars in the bathrooms. However, the driveway slope exceeds recommended standards, posing a risk to pedestrians and older residents during inclement weather.
