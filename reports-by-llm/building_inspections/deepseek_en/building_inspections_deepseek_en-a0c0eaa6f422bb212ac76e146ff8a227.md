### **4. Observations and Findings**  
- **Structural Integrity:** The building appears structurally sound, but there are signs of wear and tear consistent with its age (37 years). Minor cracks in the foundation were observed during the inspection.  
- **Electrical Systems:** The electrical wiring is outdated, with several outlets marked as non-functional due to insufficient circuit protection.  
- **Plumbing Systems:** The plumbing system appears functional, but there are signs of mildew growth on the walls and pipes, likely due to poor ventilation.  
- **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC):** The HVAC system is operational, but the ductwork shows visible rust and peeling paint.  
- **Fire Safety:** The fire alarm system was tested during the inspection and functions correctly. However, a small crack in the smoke detector panel was identified.  
- **Accessibility:** The building has functional accessibility features, but the stairs creak when occupied, and some lighting fixtures are outdated.

### **5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**  
1. **Structural Integrity:** Minor foundation cracks requiring periodic monitoring.  
   - **Recommendation:** Conduct a full structural inspection to assess the extent of any underlying issues.  

2. **Electrical Systems:** Outdated wiring and insufficient circuit protection in several outlets.  
   - **Recommendation:** Upgrade the electrical system, including replacing outdated outlets and installing modern circuit breakers.  

3. **Plumbing Systems:** Mildew growth on walls and pipes due to poor ventilation.  
   - **Recommendation:** Improve ventilation systems or install a whole-house humidifier to reduce moisture buildup.  

4. **HVAC System:** Ductwork showing visible rust and peeling paint, which may affect insulation performance.  
   - **Recommendation:** Replace the ductwork with energy-efficient, insulated ducts to improve thermal performance.  

5. **Fire Safety:** Small crack in the smoke detector panel that could potentially cause false alarms or failures.  
   - **Recommendation:** Replace the smoke detector and ensure all fire safety systems are fully functional.  

6. **Accessibility:** Creaking stairs and outdated lighting fixtures that do not comply with current accessibility standards.  
   - **Recommendation:** Upgrade the staircase to a non-creaking model and replace outdated lighting fixtures with energy-efficient, modern designs.

### **6. Compliance Summary**  
The building generally complies with local Finnish building regulations, but several minor issues fall outside of acceptable tolerance levels based on current codes. The inspector concludes that the property is in good condition for its intended use (commercial) but requires targeted maintenance to ensure long-term functionality and safety.  

---

### **7. Conclusion**  
The inspected commercial building appears to be structurally sound with no immediate safety risks. However, several minor issues require attention to ensure compliance with modern building codes and to maintain optimal performance. The inspector recommends addressing the identified issues promptly to prevent potential problems in the future.  

- **Overall Condition:** Good condition for its age.  
- **Recommendation:** Follow-up inspection within 6 months is advised to monitor any deterioration and ensure ongoing compliance with regulations.
