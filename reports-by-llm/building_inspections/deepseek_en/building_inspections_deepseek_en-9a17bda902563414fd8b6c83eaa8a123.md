### **4. Observations and Findings**  

#### **Structural Integrity**  
- The building appears structurally sound with no immediate signs of bowing or warping in the wooden beams. However, the primary wood beams (spanning approximately 6 meters) show signs of wear and tear consistent with their age.  

#### **Electrical Systems**  
- The electrical wiring is outdated and requires modernization to meet current Finnish building codes. Specifically, the circuit breakers are rated for only 15 amps, which is insufficient for modern appliances.  

#### **Plumbing Systems**  
- The plumbing system shows signs of mildew growth on the pipes due to inadequate drainage during rainstorms. The pipes are made of galvanized steel but require upgrading to copper or PVC for better water quality and durability.  

#### **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC)**  
- The HVAC system is functional but energy-efficient ratings are below current standards. Upgrading to a high-efficiency furnace and air conditioner is recommended.  

#### **Fire Safety**  
- The property has a functioning smoke detector system and a fire extinguisher rated for Class A materials. However, the sprinkler system is non-functional due to an undetected electrical issue.  

#### **Accessibility**  
- The building has basic accessibility features but lacks ramps or grab bars in the bathrooms. These modifications are necessary to ensure compliance with Finnish accessibility standards for older residents.

### **5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**  

| **Issue**                          | **Details**                                                                 | **Recommendation**                                                                 |
|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------:|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| Primary Wood Beams (6m Span)       | Outdated, showing wear and tear.                                              | Replace beams with modern-grade wood or steel to meet current standards.           |
| Electrical Wiring                   | Circuit breakers rated for only 15 amps.                                    | Upgrade electrical wiring to a 20-amp circuit breaker system.                  |
| Plumbing Pipes                      | Mildew growth due to inadequate drainage.                                     | Replace galvanized steel pipes with copper or PVC pipes.                        |
| HVAC System                         | Energy-efficient ratings below current standards.                             | Upgrade to high-efficiency furnace and air conditioner.                         |
| Fire Sprinkler System               | Non-functional due to undetected electrical issue.                           | Install a functional sprinkler system with properly sized pipes.                |
| Accessibility Features             | Lacks ramps or grab bars in bathrooms.                                         | Add ramps for exterior doors and grab bars in bathtubs and showers.            |

### **6. Compliance Summary**  
The building is generally compliant with Finnish building regulations, but it requires several modernization upgrades to meet current standards. Specifically:  
- The electrical wiring needs to be upgraded to a 20-amp circuit breaker system.  
- The HVAC system must be replaced or upgraded to high-efficiency models.  
- The sprinkler system must be installed to ensure fire safety compliance.  
- Accessibility modifications, such as ramps and grab bars, are necessary for full compliance with Finnish accessibility standards.

### **7. Conclusion**  
The residential property in Kuortane is structurally sound but requires modernization to meet current building codes and improve functionality. The primary wood beams, electrical wiring, plumbing pipes, HVAC system, and fire safety systems all require attention. No immediate repairs are necessary if the building meets the updated compliance criteria after the recommended upgrades.  

**Recommendation:**  
- Proceed with the identified upgrades to ensure long-term safety, efficiency, and compliance with Finnish building regulations.  
- Conduct a follow-up inspection within 12 months post-upgrades to verify compliance and assess structural integrity.
