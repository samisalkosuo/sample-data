### **1. General Information**  
- **Country:** Finland  
- **Municipality:** Lappeenranta  
- **Address:** [Inferred Address]  
- **Inspection Date:** 29.08.2024 (DD.MM.YYYY)  
- **Inspector Name:** Anna Lehto

### **2. Building Overview**  
- **Building Type:** Commercial (e.g., office/warehouse)  
- **Construction Year:** 1970  
- **Number of Floors:** 5  
- **Primary Materials:**  
  - Exterior: Brick and stone clapboard with rigid foam insulation  
  - Interior: Wood paneling, vinyl windows, and metal ceiling panels  

---

### **3. Inspection Context**  
The inspection was conducted on 29 August 2024 during a sub-zero weather condition characterized by strong winds, low temperatures (expected to reach -15Â°C), and heavy snowfall. The building is located in an urban area with limited access to heating resources due to its remote location.

### **4. Observations and Findings**  

#### **Structural Integrity**  
- The building appears structurally sound, with no visible signs of foundation settlement or major beam corrosion. However, the wooden floor joists show signs of wear consistent with their age (approximately 54 years).  

#### **Electrical Systems**  
- The electrical panel is operational and tested, but the circuit breakers are outdated and require modernization to comply with current Finnish building codes.  

#### **Plumbing Systems**  
- The plumbing system shows signs of mildew growth on the copper pipes, likely due to poor insulation in the walls. Visible water stains on the ceiling suggest a minor leakage issue.  

#### **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC)**  
- The HVAC unit is functional but operates inefficiently, requiring annual maintenance for optimal performance.  

#### **Fire Safety**  
- The building has standard smoke detectors installed, but they are not compliant with the latest Finnish fire safety regulations. Additional sensors in critical areas are recommended.  

#### **Accessibility**  
- The front door is slightly worn and requires a minor adjustment to operate smoothly. Handrails on the staircase are intact but could be enhanced for better safety.

### **5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**  

| **Issue**                          | **Recommendation**                                                                 |
|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Wooden floor joists require replacement (approx. 54 years old)                  | Replace with modern materials to ensure structural integrity and compliance.        |
| Outdated electrical circuit breakers   | Modernize the electrical system to meet current Finnish building codes.             |
| Mildew growth on copper pipes        | Upgrade the plumbing system with improved insulation and materials.               |
| Minor water leakage in the ceiling    | Address the water leak by upgrading the plumbing system or installing a moisture barrier. |
| Inefficient HVAC unit                | Schedule annual maintenance to optimize energy efficiency and reduce operational costs.|
| Outdated smoke detectors              | Replace with modern, compliant fire safety systems.                               |
| Slightly worn front door             | Minor adjustment to improve functionality and safety.                             |

### **6. Compliance Summary**  
The building complies with the majority of Finnish local regulations but requires updates to meet current national standards. The primary areas needing attention are the electrical system, plumbing, HVAC, and fire safety systems.

---

### **7. Conclusion**  
The commercial building in question has a good overall condition, free from major structural issues. Routine maintenance and modernization of outdated systems will ensure compliance with future regulations and preserve the building's integrity for potential resale or expansion.
