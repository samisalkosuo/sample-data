### **4. Observations and Findings**

- **Structural Integrity:**  
  - The building appears structurally sound with no signs of immediate deterioration. However, there are minor signs of wear on the brickwork due to consistent use over the years.  

- **Electrical Systems:**  
  - The electrical panel is outdated and requires modernization to comply with current Finnish building codes. Upgrading the circuit breakers and installing gfcb (gas-filled circuit breakers) is recommended.  

- **Plumbing Systems:**  
  - The plumbing system shows signs of normal wear and tear, including slightly degraded pipes in the bathrooms. Regular maintenance should be scheduled to prevent future issues.  

- **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC):**  
  - The HVAC system is functional but less energy-efficient compared to modern standards. Upgrading to a more efficient system could reduce utility costs and improve comfort.  

- **Fire Safety:**  
  - Fire extinguishers are present in all public areas, but they are outdated and require replacement. A dedicated fire safety officer should be appointed to ensure compliance with local regulations.  

- **Accessibility:**  
  - The building has basic accessibility features, including a ramp for wheelchairs and widened doorways. However, the elevator is outdated and requires modernization to meet current accessibility standards.
