### **4. Observations and Findings**

#### **Structural Integrity**  
- The building appears structurally sound, with no immediate signs of sagging or bowing in the wooden beams. However, minor signs of wear on the clapboard exterior suggest that routine maintenance may be warranted.

#### **Electrical Systems**  
- The electrical panel is operational and free from faults. The circuit breakers are in good condition but require periodic testing to ensure reliability during extreme weather conditions.

#### **Plumbing Systems**  
- The plumbing system functions efficiently, with no visible leaks or clogs. The water supply and drainage systems operate within specified pressure limits.

#### **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC)**  
- The HVAC system is functioning properly, with consistent temperature regulation throughout the building. No signs of drafts or inefficient operation were observed.

#### **Fire Safety**  
- The fire safety measures are adequate for a 2024-built structure. Fire extinguishers are present and functional, and emergency exits comply with Finnish regulations.

#### **Accessibility**  
- The building has basic accessibility features, but the stairs require modification to meet current accessibility standards (e.g., widened steps and handrails). A report on these modifications is pending.

### **5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

1. **Rot in Wooden Beams:**  
   - **Issue:** Visible signs of rot in select wooden beams spanning multiple floors, likely due to inadequate moisture control during construction or poor insulation.
   - **Recommendation:** Replace the affected beams with structurally sound alternatives (e.g., treated wood or composite materials) and address any subfloor instability.

2. **Fire Safety Updates:**  
   - **Issue:** Fire extinguishers are older than current recommendations, and emergency exits lack updated signage.
   - **Recommendation:** Conduct a fire safety audit to ensure compliance with the latest Finnish building codes. Replace outdated fire extinguishers as needed.

3. **Staircase Accessibility:**  
   - **Issue:** Stairs do not meet current accessibility standards for both load and serviceability.
   - **Recommendation:** Modify the staircase to include wider treads, increased handrail height, and additional lighting for better visibility during inspections.

4. **Water Damage Evidence:**  
   - **Issue:** Slight water damage on ceiling beams due to condensation in poorly insulated attics.
   - **Recommendation:** Improve insulation in attics or implement a moisture management system to prevent future occurrences.

### **6. Compliance Summary**

The building complies with the majority of current Finnish building regulations, including those related to structural integrity, electrical systems, and fire safety. However, minor deficiencies in accessibility and fire extinguisher maintenance indicate that routine maintenance is necessary to ensure long-term compliance.

---

### **7. Conclusion**

The building in Rauma, Finland, constructed in 2024, appears to be structurally sound with no immediate safety concerns. Minor issues related to accessibility and fire safety require attention but do not violate major regulatory standards. The building should undergo a full compliance audit within the next six months to ensure all requirements are met.
