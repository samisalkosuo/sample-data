### **3. Inspection Context**

The inspection was conducted on 16 July 2025 during mild weather conditions in Alavieska. The temperature was approximately 25Â°C, with partly cloudy skies. The inspection was a routine structural check to ensure compliance with current building codes and recommendations for the facility's continued safe operation.

### **4. Observations and Findings**

- **Structural Integrity:**  
  - The reinforced concrete shear walls were structurally sound but exhibited signs of minor wear on the southern span due to seasonal temperature fluctuations.
  - The steel beams in the northern span showed consistent deflection patterns, likely caused by uneven load distribution from the roofing system.

- **Electrical Systems:**  
  - The electrical panel was operational and free from unauthorized modifications. However, outdated circuit breakers were identified as a potential hazard if replaced with modern appliances.

- **Plumbing Systems:**  
  - The plumbing fixtures appeared in good condition, with no visible leaks or stains.
  - The water heater system required periodic maintenance to ensure optimal performance.

- **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC):**  
  - The HVAC units operated efficiently but exhibited signs of wear on the outdoor components. Regular service is recommended to prevent future breakdowns.

- **Fire Safety:**  
  - The fire extinguisher system was functional and maintained in good condition.
  - Fire-rated insulation panels were intact, though they required periodic inspection due to their advanced age.

- **Accessibility:**  
  - The facility's main entrance provided limited access for individuals with mobility challenges. A single-step staircase and exterior door with a standard handle were identified as areas requiring improvement.

### **5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

1. **Structural Concerns:**  
   - **Issue:** Minor wear on the southern span of reinforced concrete shear walls due to seasonal temperature fluctuations.  
   - **Recommendation:** Periodic monitoring and maintenance to ensure structural integrity over time.

2. **Electrical Systems:**  
   - **Issue:** Outdated circuit breakers in the electrical panel.  
   - **Recommendation:** Replace with modern, energy-efficient circuit breakers to align with current building codes.

3. **HVAC System:**  
   - **Issue:** Signs of wear on outdoor components of HVAC units.  
   - **Recommendation:** Schedule professional service and maintenance for the HVAC system to prevent future operational issues.

4. **Fire Safety:**  
   - **Issue:** No visible signs of fire-rated insulation degradation, though annual inspection is recommended.  
   - **Recommendation:** Conduct a routine check on fire-rated insulation panels to ensure compliance with updated standards.

5. **Accessibility:**  
   - **Issue:** Limited access for individuals with mobility challenges due to a single-step staircase and standard exterior door handle.  
   - **Recommendation:** Upgrade the staircase to a two-step design and replace the exterior door handle with an ergonomic, wide-handle option.

### **6. Compliance Summary**

The inspection report concludes that the facility complies with Finnish building regulations for its construction year (1986) but requires modernization in certain areas to meet current standards. The primary findings are actionable within a reasonable timeframe and do not indicate a need for immediate structural reinforcement or demolition.

---

### **7. Conclusion**

The industrial facility in Alavieska is structurally sound and operational, meeting the requirements of 2015 Finnish building codes. However, minor updates to electrical systems, HVAC maintenance, fire safety inspection, and accessibility improvements are recommended to ensure long-term compliance with modern regulations. Follow-up inspections should be scheduled within six months to evaluate the effectiveness of any implemented changes.
