### **4. Observations and Findings**
- **Structural Integrity**:  
  - The building appears structurally sound overall but shows signs of wear consistent with its age (1980). Some beams in the upper floors show visible rust and deformation, particularly around the foundation.
  
- **Electrical System**:  
  - The electrical wiring is outdated and requires modernization. Several receptacles are non-functional, and the circuit breakers need to be upgraded for safety.

- **Plumbing System**:  
  - The plumbing system appears functional but has minor leaks at the service entrance and in the basement. The pipes are made of galvanized steel, which is durable but not the latest material standard.

- **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC)**:  
  - The HVAC system is operational but energy-efficient ratings are below current Finnish standards. There are no visible signs of infiltration or poor insulation.

- **Fire Safety**:  
  - The fire safety measures are adequate for the building's age. However, smoke detectors are outdated, and there is no centralized fire alarm system with automatic sprinklers.

- **Accessibility**:  
  - The stairs to the upper floors are worn out and pose a tripping hazard. There is also limited access to the basement due to obstructed drainage pipes.

### **5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**
1. **Structural Integrity**  
   - Replace the rusted beams in the upper floors (estimated cost: 20,000 EUR).  
   - Inspect the foundation for potential subsidence issues.

2. **Electrical System**  
   - Upgrade the electrical wiring to meet current Finnish standards (estimated cost: 15,000 EUR).  
   - Replace non-functional receptacles and install new circuit breakers.

3. **Plumbing System**  
   - Repair minor leaks at the service entrance and replace old galvanized pipes in the basement with modern PEX pipes (estimated cost: 8,000 EUR).

4. **HVAC System**  
   - Upgrade the HVAC system to meet energy efficiency standards (estimated cost: 30,000 EUR).  
   - Install a central fire alarm system and automatic sprinklers in the basement.

5. **Fire Safety**  
   - Replace outdated smoke detectors with modern digital models (estimated cost: 5,000 EUR).

6. **Accessibility**  
   - Repair the worn-out stairs to improve safety and accessibility (estimated cost: 12,000 EUR).  
   - Clear the basement drainage pipes to ensure proper water flow.

### **6. Compliance Summary**
The building does not fully comply with current Finnish building regulations due to outdated materials, systems, and infrastructure. However, all identified issues are actionable and can be resolved without significant disruption or major overhauls. Modernizing the electrical, plumbing, HVAC, and fire safety systems will bring the building into compliance.

---

### **7. Conclusion**
The industrial building in Askola is structurally sound but requires modernization to meet current standards. The recommended fixes include replacing outdated materials, upgrading systems, and enhancing accessibility features. These upgrades are essential for ensuring the building's long-term stability and compliance with modern building codes.
