### **4. Observations and Findings**

#### **Structural Integrity**  
- The building appears structurally sound with no immediate signs of distress or collapse. However, there are visible signs of wear on the reinforced concrete beams, particularly in the upper floors, which may be related to fatigue over time.

#### **Electrical Systems**  
- The electrical wiring is functional but shows signs of age. Several junction boxes require updating to meet modern safety standards. No major electrical faults were observed during the inspection.

#### **Plumbing Systems**  
- The plumbing system operates efficiently and maintains proper water flow throughout the facility. However, the pipes in the basement are nearing their service life and require replacement to comply with updated building codes.

#### **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC)**  
- The HVAC system functions adequately for maintaining temperature control within the industrial space. Regular maintenance is recommended to ensure optimal performance over time.

#### **Fire Safety**  
- Fire extinguishers are present in all accessible areas, and smoke detectors are operational throughout the building. The fire safety rating of the structure aligns with current Finnish standards.

#### **Accessibility**  
- The facility includes a ramp for wheelchair access, which has been repaired to the extent possible. However, the ramp's surface is moderately worn and may require additional maintenance to ensure safety compliance.
