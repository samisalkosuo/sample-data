---

### **3. Inspection Context**  
The inspection was conducted on 11 March 2025 at the site of a six-story industrial building located in Varkaus, Finland. The weather conditions were mild but cold, with temperatures averaging -5°C (-26°F) during the day due to the northern climate. The purpose of this inspection was to conduct a routine structural evaluation of the building as it is intended for resale.

### **4. Observations and Findings**  
- **Structural Integrity:** The building appears structurally sound, with no immediate signs of bowing or excessive deflection in its steel beams. However, there are minor signs of wear on the exterior paintwork consistent with age.  
- **Electrical Systems:** The electrical panel is operational but shows signs of wear and tear. Two of the 120V circuits require upgrading to meet current safety standards.  
- **Plumbing Systems:** The plumbing system functions adequately, though there are minor cracks in the pipes that could compromise water-tightness if not addressed.  
- **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC):** The HVAC units operate efficiently but show signs of inefficiency. A minor adjustment to the ductwork is recommended for improved thermal performance.  
- **Fire Safety:** The fire extinguisher system is functional, and all emergency exits are free of obstructions. Fire safety regulations appear to be satisfied.  
- **Accessibility:** The building meets accessibility standards, with easy access to staircases and doorways.

### **5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**  
1. **Structural Concerns:**  
   - Replacement of steel beams (200mm x 8m) at intervals of every 10 years based on current construction codes.  
   - Upgrading the electrical wiring to a 240V system to align with modern safety standards.  

2. **Plumbing Issues:**  
   - Repair or replacement of minor pipe cracks to ensure water-tightness and prevent future leaks.  

3. **HVAC System:**  
   - Annual inspection and potential adjustment of ductwork for improved thermal efficiency.  

4. **Fire Safety:**  
   - Consider updating the fire extinguisher system to a Class A rating if not already done so, to align with current regulations.  

5. **Accessibility:**  
   - Ensure all staircases have handrails and are free of obstructions for compliance with accessibility standards.

### **6. Compliance Summary**  
The building complies with Finnish construction codes as it was constructed in 2012. However, several components require updates to meet the latest regulatory standards, including electrical systems, plumbing, and HVAC units. The current maintenance level is deemed sufficient for safe operation but necessitates periodic inspections and upgrades.  

---

### **7. Conclusion**  
The industrial building in Varkaus has been assessed as structurally sound with minor issues that do not compromise its safety or functionality. Routine maintenance and updates are recommended to ensure compliance with modern building codes and standards. Follow-up inspections should be scheduled every 5 years for a comprehensive evaluation of the building's structural integrity, systems, and compliance status.
