### **3. Inspection Context**

The inspection was conducted on 15 October 2024 during autumn weather conditions in Sauvo, Finland. The weather was mild with light rain and moderate temperatures, which posed minimal impact on the building's external surfaces but necessitated careful assessment of moisture-related issues.

The purpose of this inspection was to evaluate the structural integrity, compliance with local building regulations, and overall safety of the facility for its intended use as an industrial site.

### **4. Observations and Findings**

#### **Structural Integrity**  
- The steel frame appears structurally sound, with no signs of deflection or bowing. However, the integrity of the columns was briefly questioned due to visible wear on the paint finish, which is consistent with normal aging over 20 years.

#### **Electrical Systems**  
- The electrical panel is operational and meets current Finnish standards for industrial use. All circuits are correctly sized and installed.  

#### **Plumbing Systems**  
- The plumbing system functions as designed, with no leaks or malfunctions observed during the inspection. The pipes are in good condition, though some visible rust has accumulated on the pipe supports.

#### **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC)**  
- The HVAC system operates efficiently, with no signs of malfunction or damage to the ductwork. The filters appear clean and functional.  

#### **Fire Safety**  
- Fire extinguishers are present and in good working condition. The fire blankets are stored appropriately.  

#### **Accessibility**  
- The facility is accessible for all personnel, including those with mobility challenges. Handrails and emergency exits are functional and meet accessibility standards.

### **5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

| **Issue**                                                                 | **Recommendation**                                                                 |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Slight wear on the paint finish of structural columns.                   | Replace the paint finish with a more durable coating within 6 months.             |
| Visible rust on pipe supports.                                           | Replace the affected pipe supports immediately to prevent further corrosion.      |
| Minor moisture ingress detected in one of the insulation panels.          | Improve the insulation quality by installing additional layers or sealing gaps.   |
