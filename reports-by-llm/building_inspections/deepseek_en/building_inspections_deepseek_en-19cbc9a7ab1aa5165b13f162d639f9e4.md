### **4. Observations and Findings**  
- **Structural Integrity:** The building appears structurally sound, with no visible signs of major subsidence or foundation issues. However, there are signs of wear and tear consistent with a 20-year-old structure.  
- **Electrical Systems:** The electrical panel is outdated but functional. There are no immediate safety concerns, but the wiring is not up to modern standards.  
- **Plumbing Systems:** The plumbing systems appear to be in good condition. All fixtures function properly, and there are no visible leaks or clogs.  
- **Heating and Cooling Systems (HVAC):** The heating system requires annual service due to its age. The cooling system is functional but shows signs of inefficiency.  
- **Fire Safety:** The fire safety systems are compliant with current Finnish regulations. The smoke detectors and emergency exits function properly.  
- **Accessibility:** The building has basic accessibility features, including a ramp for the entrance and elevators for upper floors. However, there are no visible issues with structural accessibility.

### **5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**  
1. **Heating System:** The radiators in the basement need to be replaced due to their advanced age (20 years). This is critical for energy efficiency and compliance with updated building codes.  
2. **Electrical Wiring:** The wiring in the electrical panel needs to be upgraded to meet current Finnish electrical standards, which require more robust materials and better insulation.  
3. **Fire Safety:** While compliant with current regulations, it would be prudent to conduct a fire risk assessment to identify potential vulnerabilities.  

---

### **6. Compliance Summary**  
The building has been inspected against the local municipal building regulations and national building codes applicable in Finland. Key findings include:  
- The heating system is non-compliant due to outdated components but can be repaired with modern parts.  
- The electrical wiring requires minor updates but does not violate any compliance standards.  
- All other systems (plumbing, HVAC, fire safety) are compliant with current regulations.  

---

### **7. Conclusion**  
The building overall appears to be in good condition for its age and is well-maintained according to current standards. Annual inspections should continue to ensure ongoing compliance with building codes. The heating system requires immediate attention to improve energy efficiency and safety.
