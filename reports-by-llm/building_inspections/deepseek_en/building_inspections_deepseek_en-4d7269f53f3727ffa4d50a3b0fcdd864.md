### **4. Observations and Findings**  

#### **Structural Integrity**  
- The building appears structurally sound, with no immediate signs of foundation instability or major frame issues. However, the primary beams in the second floor exhibit minor signs of wear and tear consistent with their age (20 years).  

#### **Electrical Systems**  
- The electrical wiring is functional but outdated, requiring modernization to comply with current Finnish building codes. Specifically, the circuit breakers are outdated and unable to handle increased loads due to recent renovations plans.  

#### **Plumbing Systems**  
- The plumbing system functions adequately for its intended use (e.g., water supply and drainage). However, there is a visible blockage in one of the drains located on the third floor, which may require attention to prevent future issues.  

#### **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC)**  
- The HVAC system operates efficiently but shows signs of inefficiency due to outdated ductwork and lack of regular maintenance. Upgrading the system is recommended to improve energy efficiency and reduce operational costs.  

#### **Fire Safety**  
- The fire extinguishers are functional and properly maintained, but they do not comply with the latest Finnish fire safety regulations. Modern fire extinguishers with higher capacity (e.g., Class A or B) are required for compliance.  

#### **Accessibility**  
- The building is accessible to all individuals, including those with mobility challenges. However, the ramp leading to the second floor is slightly worn and may pose a minor risk of injury if widened.

### **5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**  
1. **Structural Integrity:**  
   - Replace outdated beams (20-year lifespan exceeded) to ensure long-term structural stability.  
   - Consider upgrading to a more durable material, such as reinforced stone masonry or concrete, for added longevity.  

2. **Electrical Systems:**  
   - Modernize the electrical wiring and circuit breakers to meet current Finnish building codes.  
   - Install energy-efficient appliances and equipment in compliance with local regulations.  

3. **Plumbing Systems:**  
   - Address the drain blockage by cleaning or replacing the affected pipe section.  
   - Regular maintenance of plumbing systems is essential to prevent future issues.  

4. **HVAC System:**  
   - Upgrade the HVAC system, including ductwork and controls, to improve energy efficiency.  
   - Schedule regular maintenance to ensure optimal performance and compliance with building regulations.  

5. **Fire Safety:**  
   - Replace outdated fire extinguishers with Class A or B models to meet Finnish fire safety standards.  
   - Ensure all fire exits and emergency equipment are in working order and comply with local regulations.  

6. **Accessibility:**  
   - Consider widening the ramp on the second floor to accommodate individuals with mobility challenges safely.  
   - Ensure compliance with Finnish accessibility guidelines for future renovations or modifications.

### **6. Compliance Summary**  
The building generally complies with local and national building regulations, but several minor issues require attention to ensure full compliance. The primary non-compliance relates to outdated electrical wiring, HVAC systems, fire safety equipment, and structural components that exceed their design lifespan.

---

### **7. Conclusion**  
The public building in Forssa is in good overall condition, with only a few minor issues requiring attention. The findings are summarized below:  

- **Structural Integrity:** Minor wear on beams; no immediate safety risks.  
- **Electrical Systems:** Outdated wiring and circuit breakers; modernization required.  
- **Plumbing Systems:** Minor blockage in drain; regular maintenance needed.  
- **HVAC System:** Inefficient ductwork; upgrade recommended for energy savings.  
- **Fire Safety:** Non-compliant fire extinguishers; updated models required.  
- **Accessibility:** Minor risk of injury on ramp; widening recommended.  

**Recommendation:** Annual inspections should be scheduled to monitor the condition of structural components, electrical systems, and HVAC equipment. Additionally, routine maintenance for plumbing systems and fire safety equipment is essential to prevent future issues.
