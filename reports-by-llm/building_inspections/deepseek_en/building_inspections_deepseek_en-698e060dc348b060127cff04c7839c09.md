### **3. Inspection Context**  
The inspection was conducted on 02.01.2025 during a light snowfall in Isojoki. The weather conditions were cold and snowy, which could have impacted the structural integrity of the building. The purpose of this inspection was to ensure compliance with current Finnish building regulations while evaluating the overall structural health and safety.

### **4. Observations and Findings**  
- **Structural Integrity:** The building appears structurally sound but shows signs of wear and tear consistent with its age (48 years since construction). Minor cracks in the foundation were observed, likely due to settlement over time.  
- **Electrical Systems:** The electrical wiring is outdated and requires modernization to meet current safety standards. There are no apparent short circuits or live wire issues during the inspection.  
- **Water and sewer systems:** The plumbing system shows signs of mildew growth on the pipes, possibly due to inadequate moisture management. The water heater is operational but shows signs of wear.  
- **Heating and Cooling Systems (HWS):** The HVAC system functions well but requires annual maintenance to ensure optimal performance during cold winters.  
- **Fire Safety:** The fire extinguisher is functional, but the sprinkler system was not tested recently. Fire safety measures appear adequate for the building's age.  
- **Accessibility:** The main entrance has a step-up that could pose difficulty for individuals with mobility challenges. Additional ramps or accommodative features may be needed.

### **5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**  
1. **Structural Concerns:**  
   - Minor foundation cracks requiring observation over time.  
   - Possible settlement issues due to aging materials.  

2. **Electrical Systems:**  
   - Outdated wiring that requires modernization.  
   - Consider replacing outdated circuit breakers with gfcb (GFCB) for enhanced safety.  

3. **Water and sewer systems:**  
   - Mildew growth on plumbing pipes; recommend professional cleaning or replacement of affected sections.  
   - Water heater needs annual maintenance to prevent thermal bridging issues.  

4. **Heating and Cooling Systems (HWS):**  
   - Annual inspection required for optimal performance during cold periods.  
   - Consider upgrading the HVAC system if energy efficiency improvements are desired.  

5. **Fire Safety:**  
   - Verify that the sprinkler system is operational and tested according to Finnish regulations.  
   - Ensure all fire extinguishers are functional and properly maintained.  

6. **Accessibility:**  
   - Improve accessibility by adding ramps or accommodative features at the main entrance.

### **6. Compliance Summary**  
The building does not fully comply with current Finnish building codes due to its age and outdated systems. Minor repairs, such as updating electrical wiring and replacing mildew-prone plumbing, are recommended to ensure compliance. Major overhauls may be necessary in the next 10-15 years to maintain long-term structural integrity.

---

### **7. Conclusion**  
The Isojoki Community Center is in good overall condition but shows signs of age-related wear and tear. Minor repairs can address current issues, while a full renovation or major overhaul may be required in the coming decade. Follow-up inspections are recommended every 5 years to ensure continued compliance with building regulations.
