#### **Structural Integrity**  
- The steel beams supporting the second floor were slightly worn but appeared stable overall. No immediate threats to structural integrity were observed.  

#### **Electrical Systems**  
- The electrical wiring was in good condition, but there were signs of minor corrosion on the circuit breakers and switches.  

#### **Plumbing Systems**  
- The pipes in the heating system showed light rust along their surfaces, likely due to exposure over time. No leaks or significant issues were detected.

### **5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**  

| **Issue**                     | **Details**                                                                 | **Recommendation**                                                                 |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------:|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| **Steel Beams (2nd Floor)**   | Slight wear on the beams, likely due to normal usage over time.              | Replace beams at regular intervals as per maintenance schedules.                  |
| **Electrical Wiring**          | Minor corrosion on circuit breakers and switches.                         | Replace outdated circuit components as needed.                                   |
| **Plumbing Pipes**            | Light rust along pipe surfaces in the heating system.                       | Clean or replace affected pipes to prevent further corrosion.                   |
| **HVAC System**               | Minor dirt accumulation on HVAC coils, leading to reduced efficiency.       | Clean the HVAC units and replace old components as needed.                        |
| **Fire Safety Systems**       | Outdated smoke detectors requiring replacement.                              | Replace all smoke detectors in the building within the next 2 years.              |
| **Door Hinges**               | Slight wear on main entrance hinges, leading to reduced functionality.      | Lubricate hinges immediately for improved door operation.                       |

### **6. Compliance Summary**  
The inspection revealed that the building partially complies with current Finnish building regulations. While there are areas requiring attention, recent maintenance activities have ensured that the structure remains safe and functional. However, updates to fire safety systems and regular HVAC maintenance are recommended to fully comply with modern standards.

### **7. Conclusion**  
The industrial building in Loppi is in good overall condition, with minor issues that do not compromise its structural integrity or safety. The primary recommendations are to address the outdated smoke detectors and ensure regular maintenance of HVAC and electrical systems. If any significant issues arise in the next 2-3 years, a full renovation or major repair may be required.
