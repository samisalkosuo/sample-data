### 4. Observations and Findings  
- **Structural Integrity**: The building appears structurally sound, but there are signs of wear and tear consistent with its age (e.g., visible cracks in the foundation wall).  
- **Electrical Systems**: The electrical wiring is outdated; upgrading to a smart grid system is recommended.  
- **Water Supply**: There are minor leaks from the water supply system that likely originated from the building's original design.  
- **Heating and Cooling (H/C) Systems**: The HVAC system shows signs of inefficiency, with higher energy consumption than modern standards recommend.  
- **Fire Safety**: The fire extinguisher is functional but outdated; an updated system should be installed.  
- **Accessibility**: The main staircase lacks handrails on the upper floors, posing a safety hazard for older users and visitors.

### 5. Identified Issues and Recommendations  
1. **Structural Concerns**:  
   - Replace the foundation wall (dimensions: 2 meters thick x 30 meters long) to improve load-bearing capacity.  
   - Repair or replace beams at floors 4 and 6, which show signs of fatigue due to repeated stress from water leaks.  

2. **Electrical Systems**:  
   - Upgrade the electrical panelboard to a modern, energy-efficient model with smart monitoring capabilities.  
   - Replace all outdated circuit breakers and rewiring components.  

3. **Water Supply**:  
   - Replace the old lead-based pipes in the water supply system (length: 150 meters) with non-corrosive materials.  
   - Install a new pressure regulator to reduce water hammer effects during usage.  

4. **H/C Systems**:  
   - Upgrade the HVAC system to meet current energy efficiency standards, reducing annual heating and cooling costs by up to 30%.  

5. **Fire Safety**:  
   - Replace the existing fire extinguisher with a modern, programmable unit capable of covering the entire building in case of emergencies.  

6. **Accessibility**:  
   - Install handrails on all staircases, starting from the first floor upwards.  
   - Ensure that all doors and windows have proper safety hardware to prevent unauthorized access.

### 6. Compliance Summary  
The building complies with current Finnish construction codes in general but requires minor updates to meet modern standards. Key areas needing attention include electrical systems, water supply efficiency, HVAC performance, fire safety, and accessibility features.

---

### 7. Conclusion  
The Institute of Public Education is in good overall structural condition but shows signs of age-related wear and tear. The identified issues are actionable and do not pose immediate safety risks but should be addressed to ensure long-term functionality and compliance with building regulations. A follow-up inspection is recommended within six months after implementing the proposed fixes.
