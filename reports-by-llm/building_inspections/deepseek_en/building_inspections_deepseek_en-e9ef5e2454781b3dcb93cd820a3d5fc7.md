### **1. General Information**

- **Country:** Finland  
- **Municipality:** Rantasalmi  
- **Address:** [Inferred Address]: Rantasalmi, Lapland, FI  
- **Inspection Date:** 19.11.2024 (DD.MM.YYYY)  
- **Inspector Name:** Anna Lehto

### **2. Building Overview**

- **Building Type:** Residential apartment building  
- **Construction Year:** 2015  
- **Number of Floors:** 7  
- **Primary Materials:** Wood clapboard, concrete, insulation panels (EPS), and aluminum windows/doors  

---

### **3. Inspection Context**

The inspection was conducted on 19 November 2024 during a cold and snowy winter day in Lapland. The temperature was below freezing, with windchills reaching -15Â°C, resulting in icy conditions. The building was inspected as part of the routine maintenance check for potential resale purposes.

### **4. Observations and Findings**

#### **Structural Integrity**  
- The building appears structurally sound with no visible cracks or warping in the wooden clapboard panels. However, there are minor signs of expansion joints around windows and doors that may require attention to prevent moisture damage over time.

#### **Electrical System**  
- The electrical panel is operational but shows signs of wear on the circuit breakers. Regular maintenance should be scheduled to ensure optimal performance during cold weather.

#### **Plumbing System**  
- The plumbing system functions adequately, with no visible leaks or clogs. The pipes are insulated and appear free of ice buildup in the crawl spaces.

#### **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC)**  
- The HVAC system operates efficiently but shows signs of inefficiency due to outdated ductwork. Modernization could improve energy efficiency and reduce operational costs.

#### **Fire Safety**  
- Fire extinguishers are present and functional. The fire alarm system is operational with working smoke detectors throughout the building.

#### **Accessibility**  
- The building has basic accessibility features, including a ramp at the entrance and handrails in hallways. However, the elevator does not meet Finnish accessibility standards; it lacks sufficient braking force to stop safely under load.

### **5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

| **Issue**                     | **Details**                                                                 | **Recommendation**                                                                 |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Outdated Electrical Panel       | Circuit breakers show signs of wear                                         | Replace or upgrade circuit breakers with recessive units.                       |
| Inefficient HVAC System         | Ductwork is outdated and inefficient                                           | Upgrade HVAC system to include modern ductwork and smart thermostats.            |
| Basic Accessibility Features  | Lacks sufficient braking force in the elevator                                     | Modernize elevator with additional braking mechanisms.                         |

### **6. Compliance Summary**

The building complies with current Finnish construction codes for residential structures built between 2010 and 2015. However, it is recommended to update certain components, such as electrical systems and HVAC units, to align with modern standards.

---

### **7. Conclusion**

The building in question is structurally sound but requires minor updates to enhance efficiency and accessibility. No immediate safety risks were identified during the inspection. Follow-up inspections should be scheduled within six months to ensure compliance with updated building codes.
