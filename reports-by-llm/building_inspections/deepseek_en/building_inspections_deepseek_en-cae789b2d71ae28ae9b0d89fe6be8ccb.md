### **2. Building Overview**  
- **Building Type:** Industrial (Factory/Warehouse)  
- **Construction Year:** 1983  
- **Number of Floors:** 3  
- **Primary Materials:** Steel beams, concrete floors and walls, reinforced cementitious composite (RCC) roofs.  

---

### **3. Inspection Context**  
The inspection was conducted on 18 July 2025 during a partly cloudy day with light rain. The temperature was approximately 22Â°C, typical for summer in Parainen. The purpose of the inspection was to evaluate the structural integrity and compliance with current building codes, as this facility is intended for resale after renovation.

### **4. Observations and Findings**  
- **Structural Integrity:** The steel framework appears structurally sound but shows signs of fatigue, particularly in the supporting beams. Minor cracks in the concrete walls were observed on closer inspection.  
- **Electrical Systems:** The wiring is outdated and not fully compliant with current Finnish electrical codes. There are signs of corrosion on the electrical components.  
- **Plumbing Systems:** The plumbing system appears functional but shows evidence of water damage due to poor insulation, affecting thermal performance.  
- **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC):** The HVAC system is operational but inefficient, with insufficient insulation in the attic area leading to higher energy consumption.  
- **Fire Safety:** The fire safety systems are outdated and do not meet current Finnish standards. Fire extinguishers are present but not properly maintained.  
- **Accessibility:** The access doors are worn out and require replacement. There is also a visible sagging ceiling in one of the workshop areas, indicating potential structural issues over time.

### **5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**  
1. **Structural Integrity:**  
   - Replace the supporting beams to address fatigue and ensure long-term stability.  
   - Repair minor cracks in concrete walls using appropriate materials.  

2. **Electrical Systems:**  
   - Update the wiring to meet current Finnish electrical codes, including upgrading circuit breakers and fuses.  
   - Inspect and replace corroded electrical components.  

3. **Plumbing Systems:**  
   - Upgrade the plumbing system to improve thermal performance and energy efficiency.  
   - Replace outdated pipes and ensure proper insulation in affected areas.  

4. **HVAC System:**  
   - Re-insulate the attic area to enhance insulation and reduce energy consumption.  
   - Evaluate and upgrade the HVAC system if necessary.  

5. **Fire Safety Systems:**  
   - Update fire extinguishers to modern models with improved performance and maintenance schedules.  
   - Ensure compliance with current Finnish fire safety regulations, including sprinkler systems where applicable.  

6. **Accessibility:**  
   - Replace the worn-out access doors with durable, weather-resistant alternatives.  
   - Conduct a structural assessment of the sagging ceiling to address potential issues.  

---

### **6. Compliance Summary**  
The building partially complies with current Finnish building codes:  
- Structural integrity is acceptable but requires improvement in key areas (e.g., beam replacement).  
- Electrical systems are non-compliant and require significant upgrades.  
- Plumbing, HVAC, and fire safety systems are non-compliant and need immediate attention.  

---

### **7. Conclusion**  
The industrial facility in Parainen is in satisfactory overall condition but requires several upgrades to meet modern building standards. Immediate action is recommended for the electrical, plumbing, and fire safety systems to ensure compliance with current regulations. Structural improvements should be prioritized to prevent long-term issues.  

**Recommendation:** Conduct a comprehensive renovation to address all identified issues and bring the facility up to standard.
