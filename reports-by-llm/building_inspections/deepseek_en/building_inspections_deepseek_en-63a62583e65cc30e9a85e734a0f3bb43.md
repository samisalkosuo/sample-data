### **2. Building Overview**  
- **Building Type:** Residential  
- **Construction Year:** 1991  
- **Number of Floors:** 5  
- **Primary Materials:** Brick masonry with concrete block framing, double-glazed windows, and insulation panels.  

---

### **3. Inspection Context**  
The inspection was conducted on 23 July 2025 during the hottest part of the summer in Lapinlahti (average temperature: 28°C). The weather conditions were hot and sunny with occasional afternoon thunderstorms. The purpose of this inspection was to evaluate the structural integrity, safety, and compliance of the residential building for potential resale or further renovation.

### **4. Observations and Findings**  

#### **Structural Integrity**  
- The brick masonry exhibits light wear and uneven expansion joints due to thermal stress over the years. Repointing is recommended within 6 months to restore structural stability.  
- The foundation shows signs of settlement, likely caused by differential ground movement during construction or heavy loads from the building’s contents. Immediate stabilization measures are required.  

#### **Electrical System**  
- The wiring system appears to be outdated and non-compliant with current Finnish electrical codes. Replacing the 1991-era circuit breakers with modern, energy-efficient models is essential for safety and efficiency.  
- The electrical panel has not been updated since construction, posing a risk of overheating in high-intensity appliances or during extreme weather conditions.  

#### **Plumbing System**  
- The plumbing system shows signs of rust on the pipes due to prolonged exposure to outdoor moisture. Immediate replacement of the affected pipe sections is required to prevent further corrosion and leaks.  
- The water heater is outdated and inefficient, with no evidence of proper insulation around the hot water storage tank. Upgrading to a modern, energy-efficient system is recommended.  

#### **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC)**  
- The HVAC system operates efficiently during the day but struggles in the late afternoon when temperatures rise above 30°C. Upgrading to a more efficient cooling mechanism is necessary for optimal performance during hot weather.  
- The ductwork shows signs of mildew growth due to poor ventilation. Proper sealing and maintenance of the ductwork are required to prevent mold growth.  

#### **Fire Safety**  
- The fire extinguisher system was tested in 2019 but has not been inspected since then. It is recommended to retest the extinguishers immediately, following Finnish fire safety regulations.  
- The smoke detectors and alarm system were last serviced in 2017. Updating these systems to modern models with improved sensitivity is necessary for compliance.  

#### **Accessibility**  
- The building has a sloping garden leading to the front door, which poses difficulty for individuals with mobility challenges. A ramp or step-by-step approach should be installed at the earliest opportunity.

### **5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**  
| **Issue**                                                                 | **Recommendation**                                                                 |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Light brick wear and uneven expansion joints.                              | Repointing bricks within 6 months to restore structural stability.                |
| Foundation settlement requiring stabilization.                             | Immediate measures to prevent further ground movement.                            |
| Outdated electrical wiring system.                                         | Replace circuit breakers with modern, energy-efficient models.                    |
| Rust on plumbing pipes; immediate replacement of affected sections.        | Upgrade plumbing system components to prevent corrosion and leaks.               |
| Outdated water heater and lack of insulation around the storage tank.      | Replace with an energy-efficient, insulated water heater.                         |
| HVAC inefficiency during peak afternoon temperatures.                     | Upgrade cooling mechanism for optimal performance.                                |
| Mildew growth in ductwork; proper sealing required.                        | Improve ventilation to prevent mold growth.                                       |
| Outdated fire extinguisher system (last tested in 2019).                  | Re-test immediately and consider replacing the system if necessary.              |
| Outdated smoke detectors and alarm system (last serviced in 2017).        | Update systems to modern models with improved sensitivity.                        |

### **6. Compliance Summary**  
The building partially complies with Finnish building codes but requires significant upgrades to meet current standards. Key areas of non-compliance include the electrical wiring, plumbing system, HVAC efficiency, and fire safety measures. Immediate action is required for full compliance.

---

### **7. Conclusion**  
The residential building in Lapinlahti (address: Säiläpingi 45) was found to be structurally sound but requires several upgrades to meet modern standards. The primary issues are related to the age of the building and outdated systems, which pose risks to safety, efficiency, and longevity. Immediate action is recommended for the electrical wiring, plumbing, HVAC, and fire safety systems. A follow-up inspection within 6 months will be conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed fixes.
