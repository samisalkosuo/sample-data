### **4. Observations and Findings**  

#### **Structural Integrity**  
- The building appears structurally sound, with no visible signs of foundation settlement or major frame issues. However, the concrete columns show signs of minor stress cracks due to seasonal temperature fluctuations over the years.  

#### **Electrical Systems**  
- The electrical panel is outdated and requires modernization. Two of the branch circuits are overloaded, posing a risk of fire hazard if not addressed promptly.  

#### **Plumbing Systems**  
- The plumbing system appears functional, but there are visible signs of water damage on the ceiling in one of the offices. This is likely due to condensation from malfunctioning ventilation systems.  

#### **Heating and Cooling (HVAC)**  
- The HVAC system operates efficiently during the day but struggles with heating performance in the winter months. The radiators are slightly worn but functional, though upgrading may be advisable for energy efficiency.  

#### **Fire Safety**  
- Fire extinguishers are present and functional, but they lack a dedicated fire suppression system installed in compliance with modern regulations.  

#### **Accessibility**  
- The building is accessible to all individuals, including those with mobility challenges. However, the main staircase lacks handrails on the upper floors, which could pose a safety hazard for older residents or visitors.
