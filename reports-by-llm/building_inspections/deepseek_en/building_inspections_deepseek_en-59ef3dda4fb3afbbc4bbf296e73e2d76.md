### **2. Building Overview**

- **Building Type:** Industrial (e.g., manufacturing facility)  
- **Construction Year:** 1993  
- **Number of Floors:** 4 (including basement and attic, totaling 6 levels)  
- **Primary Materials:** Steel-frame structure with concrete foundations; exterior walls constructed from reinforced steel panels and insulation; roof system made of galvanized steel sheets.  

---

### **3. Inspection Context**

The inspection was conducted on 11 January 2025 during a routine building check to assess the structural integrity and compliance with current safety standards. The weather conditions were freezing, with temperatures below zero, which could impact the foundation stability and insulation performance of the building.

**Purpose of Inspection:** Routine structural evaluation for ongoing maintenance and operational readiness.  

---

### **4. Observations and Findings**

- **Structural Integrity:**  
  - The steel-frame structure appears sound, but there are signs of foundation expansion due to differential settling caused by soil compression over time.  
  - The concrete columns in the basement exhibit minor cracking at the base, likely due to repeated freeze-thaw cycles.  

- **Electrical Systems:**  
  - The electrical panel is outdated and requires modernization to meet current safety standards (e.g., updated circuit breakers and surge protection).  
  - There are no visible signs of electrical malfunctions during the inspection; however, the system was not tested for functionality.  

- **Plumbing Systems:**  
  - The drainage pipes in the basement are partially clogged due to years of accumulated debris, which could lead to water damage if left unresolved.  
  - The heating and cooling systems operate efficiently but lack proper insulation, contributing to higher energy consumption.  

- **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC):**  
  - The HVAC system is functional but shows signs of inefficiency due to outdated ductwork and insufficient airflow in certain areas.  
  - The system was not tested for performance during the inspection.  

- **Fire Safety:**  
  - The fire extinguishers are in good condition, but they lack modern features such as automatic suppression systems or pressure-relief valves.  
  - Fire codes require all extinguishers to be updated to Level 2 (minimum pressure-rated) by this year's standards.  

- **Accessibility:**  
  - The building has basic accessibility features, including a ramp at the entrance and grab bars in the bathroom.  
  - The staircase lacks handrails on the upper levels, posing a minor safety hazard for elderly residents or individuals with mobility impairments.

### **5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

| **Category**                | **Issue**                                                                 | **Recommendation**                                                                 |
|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Structural Integrity          | Foundation expansion cracks at concrete columns in the basement.        | Reinforce the affected concrete columns using steel plates or fiber-reinforced polymers. |
| Electrical Systems           | Outdated electrical panel and lack of testing.                          | Replace the electrical panel with a modern, energy-efficient one and test for functionality. |
| Plumbing Systems             | Partially clogged drainage pipes in the basement.                       | Clear the debris from the pipes to prevent water damage or foundation issues.        |
| HVAC System                  | Inefficient ductwork and insufficient insulation.                        | Upgrade the ductwork and install additional insulation to improve energy efficiency.  |
| Fire Safety                 | Outdated fire extinguishers without modern features.                     | Replace all fire extinguishers with Level 2-rated systems as per current codes.    |
| Accessibility                | Lack of handrails on the staircase upper levels.                         | Install handrails on all staircases to enhance safety for users.                   |

### **6. Compliance Summary**

The building partially complies with current Finnish building regulations but requires significant upgrades to meet modern standards. Key areas needing improvement include electrical systems, plumbing efficiency, fire safety equipment, and accessibility features.

- **Compliance with Fire Safety:** Partially compliant (fire extinguishers need updating).  
- **Compliance with Structural Integrity:** Mostly compliant, with minor foundation issues requiring attention.  
- **Compliance with Accessibility:** Partially compliant, with some improvements needed for upper-level staircases.

### **7. Conclusion**

The industrial building in Outokumpu is structurally sound but shows signs of age-related wear and tear. The primary issues identified are related to outdated infrastructure (e.g., electrical systems, fire extinguishers) and minor safety hazards (e.g., missing handrails). To ensure long-term safety and compliance with modern building codes, immediate action should be taken to address the identified issues.

**Recommendation:** Conduct a full renovation or upgrade if significant repairs are required. If no major renovations are planned in the near future, schedule follow-up inspections within six months to reassess compliance with current standards.
