### **4. Observations and Findings**  

#### **Structural Integrity**  
- The building appears structurally sound, with no immediate signs of sagging beams or major foundation issues. However, there are minor signs of wear on the exterior shear walls due to years of exposure to environmental factors.  

#### **Electrical Systems**  
- The electrical panel is outdated and requires modernization to comply with current Finnish building codes. There are no active electrical faults observed during the inspection.  

#### **Plumbing Systems**  
- The plumbing system appears functional, but there are minor leaks in the pipes located near the foundation. These are likely due to age-related expansion joints and do not pose a safety risk.  

#### **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC)**  
- The HVAC system is operational and maintains comfortable indoor temperatures during the inspection period. However, it is noted that the system could be more energy-efficient with modern technology upgrades.  

#### **Fire Safety**  
- Fire extinguishers are present and functional. The fire safety rating of the building complies with Finnish regulations for a public facility constructed in 2001. No visible signs of smoke detectors or emergency exits were observed during the inspection.
