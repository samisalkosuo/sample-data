### **4. Observations and Findings**  

#### **Structural Integrity**  
- The building appears structurally sound with no signs of immediate collapse or instability. However, there are minor signs of wear on the foundation due to consistent load distribution over decades.  

#### **Electrical Systems**  
- The electrical panel is outdated but functional. There are visible cracks in the wiring and insulation issues in some areas requiring attention.  

#### **Plumbing Systems**  
- The plumbing system appears to be in good condition, with no major leaks or clogs observed during the inspection. However, there are signs of water damage on the ceiling due to condensation from high humidity levels over the years.  

#### **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC)**  
- The HVAC system is operational but shows signs of inefficiency. There are minor cracks in the insulation panels, and the air conditioning unit requires periodic maintenance to maintain optimal performance.  

#### **Fire Safety**  
- The fire safety measures appear adequate for a public building. All emergency exits are functional, and fire extinguishers are properly maintained. Fire-rated doors are intact, but there is minimal damage to wall insulation in one of the offices due to previous fire incidents.  

#### **Accessibility**  
- The building has basic accessibility features, including a ramp at the entrance and grab bars in the bathrooms. However, there are no elevators installed, which could be an issue for older employees or guests with mobility challenges.
