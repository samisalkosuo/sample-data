### **1. General Information**  
- **Country:** Finland  
- **Municipality:** Marttila  
- **Address:** Marttilan Yrityskaupungistuksen Katu 4A, Marttila  
- **Inspection Date:** 17.03.2025 (DD.MM.YYYY)  
- **Inspector Name:** Anna Lehto

### **2. Building Overview**  
- **Building Type:** Public (Community Center/School)  
- **Construction Year:** 2008  
- **Number of Floors:** 5  
- **Primary Materials:** Metal frame with wood cladding, double-glazed windows, and insulation panels.  

---

### **3. Inspection Context**  
On the morning of the inspection, March 17, 2025, the weather was partly cloudy with a slight chance of sun. The temperature was mild, around 10°C (50°F), with moderate humidity due to spring-like conditions in Marttila.

The purpose of this inspection was to evaluate the structural integrity and compliance of the building as per current Finnish building codes.  

---

### **4. Observations and Findings**  
- **Structural Integrity:** The building appears structurally sound, but signs of wear and tear are evident due to its age (15 years since construction). The metal frame shows minor rust on the exterior panels, and the wood cladding has slight warping in areas affected by thermal expansion.  
- **Electrical System:** The electrical wiring is outdated and requires modernization. There are visible signs of moisture damage inside the walls, likely due to inadequate insulation during construction.  
- **Plumbing System:** The plumbing system shows signs of age-related deterioration, with visible rust on the copper pipes and weak connections at several joints. A small water leak was detected near the foundation.  
- **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC):** The HVAC system is functional but not energy-efficient. Older components are present, such as gas-charged radiators and a 1995 model refrigerator.  
- **Fire Safety:** The fire safety measures appear adequate for the building's age. Fire extinguishers are installed in accordance with regulations, and all emergency exits have working signage.  
- **Accessibility:** The building has basic accessibility features but lacks ramps at several entrances and exits. There is a single staircase leading to the second floor, which could be replaced with a ramp for better inclusivity.

### **5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**  
1. **Structural Reinforcement:** The metal frame requires additional support beams in areas of thermal expansion to prevent further warping or cracking.  
2. **Electrical System Upgrades:** Modernize the wiring, install gf-Certified circuit breakers, and replace outdated components with energy-efficient equivalents.  
3. **Plumbing System Renovation:** Replace all copper pipes with PEX or PVC with better insulation and sealant. Address the water leak by replacing the faulty section of pipework.  
4. **HVAC Efficiency Improvements:** Upgrade the HVAC system to a high-efficiency model, such as a heat pump, and replace older components like radiators and refrigerators.  
5. **Fire Safety Enhancements:** Ensure all fire extinguishers are within specification and properly maintained. Consider upgrading to automatic systems if not already done.  
6. **Accessibility Upgrades:** Replace the single staircase with ramps at all entry/exit points for better inclusivity.  

---

### **6. Compliance Summary**  
The building does not meet current Finnish building codes due to its age and outdated construction materials. Significant renovations, including structural reinforcement, electrical upgrades, plumbing modernization, HVAC efficiency improvements, fire safety enhancements, and accessibility upgrades, are required to ensure compliance with modern regulations.

---

### **7. Conclusion**  
The building is in satisfactory overall condition but requires substantial attention to address the identified issues. Proper implementation of the recommendations will improve its safety, energy efficiency, and compliance with current building standards.
