### **3. Inspection Context**

On the morning of the inspection (27 January 2025), the weather conditions were mild but cold, with a slight chance of light snow in the early morning hours. The temperature was around -5°C, making it necessary to conduct the inspection indoors and use appropriate heating systems.

The purpose of this inspection was to evaluate the structural integrity, compliance with building regulations, and overall safety of the property for potential resale or further use as an industrial facility.

### **4. Observations and Findings**

#### **Structural Integrity**
- The foundation exhibited signs of settling due to the weight of the industrial machinery stored on-site over the years.
- The beams in the second floor were slightly cracked, requiring visual inspection and possible reinforcement.

#### **Electrical Systems**
- The electrical wiring was outdated and required modernization to meet current safety standards. Specifically, the circuit breakers and insulation were identified as potential hazards if not updated.

#### **Plumbing Systems**
- The plumbing system appeared functional but showed signs of wear and tear in the pipes. A partial replacement of the pipe network is recommended for long-term stability.

#### **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) Systems**
- The HVAC system operated efficiently during the inspection period but was noted to be older than required standards. Upgrading to a more energy-efficient model would enhance performance in future winters.

#### **Fire Safety**
- The fire extinguisher system was functional and maintained properly. However, the sprinkler system had not been tested recently and was considered non-compliant with current regulations.

#### **Accessibility**
- The building door hinges were worn out, posing a safety hazard for individuals moving through the facility. Replacement is recommended to ensure smooth operations.

### **5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

| **Issue**                          | **Details**                                                                 | **Recommendation**                                                                 |
|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------:|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| Structural settling in foundation    | The foundation has settled slightly due to heavy machinery use.              | Reinforce the foundation or install new piers as per engineering guidelines.     |
| Outdated electrical wiring           | Circuit breakers and insulation are outdated.                               | Replace with modern, energy-efficient wiring systems.                              |
| Plumbing system wear and tear        | Pipes require partial replacement for stability.                             | Schedule a professional plumber to replace the pipe network.                        |
| HVAC system age                      | Older than required standards; needs modernization.                          | Upgrade to an energy-efficient HVAC system.                                       |
| Non-compliant sprinkler system       | Sprinkler system not tested recently.                                         | Conduct a fire safety inspection and ensure compliance with local regulations.    |
| Worn-out door hinges                 | Potential safety hazard for personnel movement.                               | Replace the door hinges immediately to prevent accidents.                            |

### **6. Compliance Summary**

The building was inspected against the national building codes applicable in Finland. While some components required updates or reinforcement, the overall compliance status is satisfactory if the recommended upgrades are implemented.

---

### **7. Conclusion**

The industrial facility appears to be structurally sound and functional for its intended use. However, it requires attention to modernize electrical systems, upgrade plumbing, and ensure fire safety compliance. Annual inspections should continue to monitor structural integrity and operational efficiency.

**Recommendation:** Conduct a follow-up inspection within the next 12 months after implementing the recommended upgrades to verify long-term stability.
