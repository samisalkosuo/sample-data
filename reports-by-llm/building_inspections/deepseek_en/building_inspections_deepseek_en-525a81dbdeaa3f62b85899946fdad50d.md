---

### **3. Inspection Context**  
The inspection was conducted on a partly cloudy day in Ylöjärvi during midsummer, with temperatures ranging from 20°C to 32°C. The weather conditions were ideal for the inspection, allowing for thorough assessment of structural and functional components.

The purpose of this inspection was to evaluate the general condition of the building as part of routine maintenance checks required by local building regulations.

### **4. Observations and Findings**  

#### **Structural Integrity**  
- The building appears structurally sound with no visible signs of uplift or bowing. However, there are minor cracks in the foundation wall at floor level that may indicate underlying subsidence issues requiring further investigation.

#### **Electrical Systems**  
- The electrical panel is outdated and requires modernization to comply with current Finnish building codes. The wiring is inefficient, leading to higher energy consumption during peak periods.

#### **Water Supply/Plumbing**  
- The water pressure in the supply system has been reduced due to clogs in the pipes. A partial blockage was identified near the foundation, which may indicate a need for pipe cleaning or replacement.

#### **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC)**  
- The HVAC system is operational but shows signs of wear and tear. The cooling coil requires servicing to improve efficiency and reduce energy consumption.

#### **Fire Safety**  
- The fire extinguisher on the primary floor is functional but not compliant with updated regulations requiring a dedicated fire suppression system for multi-family buildings.

#### **Accessibility**  
- The building has restricted doorways, making it challenging for individuals with mobility issues to navigate. Additional ramps and widened doorways are recommended for full accessibility compliance.

### **6. Compliance Summary**  
The building partially complies with local and national building regulations. Key areas requiring improvement include electrical systems, plumbing efficiency, HVAC equipment, and accessibility features.

---

### **7. Conclusion**  
The Ylöjärvi Cultural and Business Center is in good overall condition, but several components require attention to ensure compliance with modern building standards. The recommended upgrades will enhance the building's functionality, safety, and energy efficiency without compromising its structural integrity.

If any of these improvements are not implemented, periodic maintenance checks may be necessary to prevent future issues. Further assistance or inspection can be arranged upon request.
