- **Primary Materials:** Steel and concrete with reinforced cementitious composite (RCC) beams and slab floors.  

---

### **3. Inspection Context**  
The inspection was conducted on 25 September 2024, during a partly cloudy autumn day in Finland, with light mist and occasional rain. The weather conditions were ideal for the inspection process, as no significant outdoor inspections were required beyond checking structural components. The purpose of this inspection was to perform a routine structural evaluation of the building to ensure compliance with current Finnish building regulations.

---

### **4. Observations and Findings**  
- **Structural Integrity:** The building appears structurally sound, with no signs of major subsidence or bowing. All beams are securely supported, and the foundation remains stable.  
- **Electrical Systems:** The electrical panel is operational but shows signs of moderate wear. The wiring is intact, and all circuits function properly.  
- **Plumbing Systems:** The plumbing system appears to be in good condition. All pipes are free from major leaks, and the drainage systems operate efficiently.  
- **Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC):** The HVAC system operates effectively, with no significant issues observed during the inspection. However, there is room for improvement regarding energy efficiency.  
- **Fire Safety:** The fire safety measures are adequate. All emergency exits are functional, and the smoke detectors are operational. Fire extinguishers are present in designated areas.  
- **Accessibility:** The building has basic accessibility features, but there are limitations for individuals with mobility challenges. Handrails on exterior staircases are present but require improvement to meet modern accessibility standards.

### **5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**  
1. **Electrical Systems:**  
   - **Issue:** The electrical panel shows moderate wear, which could potentially lead to future component failures if not addressed.  
   - **Recommendation:** Replace the outdated 200-amp panel with a 300-amp panel to accommodate increased demand in modern industrial settings.  

2. **Plumbing Systems:**  
   - **Issue:** A minor water leak was detected near one of the storage areas, likely due to condensation or improper sealing of pipes.  
   - **Recommendation:** Conduct a thorough inspection of all pipes and seals to prevent future leaks. Replace any faulty components as identified.  

3. **Fire Safety:**  
   - **Issue:** The fire extinguisher is located in an area that does not comply with the latest Finnish fire safety regulations regarding placement and accessibility.  
   - **Recommendation:** Re-evaluate the placement of all fire extinguishers to ensure compliance with updated regulations, including improved signage for easy access.  

4. **Accessibility:**  
   - **Issue:** The exterior staircases lack adequate handrails, which could pose a hazard to individuals with mobility issues.  
   - **Recommendation:** Install additional handrails on the exterior stairs and ensure all interior staircases meet modern accessibility standards.  

5. **HVAC System:**  
   - **Issue:** The HVAC system is inefficient, consuming more energy than necessary for heating and cooling operations.  
   - **Recommendation:** Evaluate the HVAC system for efficiency upgrades, such as upgrading to high-efficiency condensing units or improving insulation in the building envelope.  

---

### **6. Compliance Summary**  
The inspection revealed minor issues that do not violate current Finnish building regulations. The building is compliant with updated local and national standards, including those related to structural integrity, fire safety, and basic accessibility features. No significant non-compliance was observed during the inspection.

---

### **7. Conclusion**  
The industrial building in Soini, constructed in 2013, is in good overall condition. Minor updates are recommended to address electrical panel wear, water leak issues, fire extinguisher placement, and accessibility improvements. These upgrades will ensure long-term functionality, safety, and compliance with modern building standards.
