Construction Year: 1979
Number of Floors: 5
Primary Materials: Reinforced concrete, brick, and timber

**3. Inspection Context**

Weather Conditions: The inspection was conducted during a typical Finnish winter day with temperatures around -10째C, clear skies, and snow covering the ground. The purpose of this inspection was to assess the building's condition for potential renovation purposes.

**4. Observations and Findings**

Structural: The building appears structurally sound, with no visible signs of significant damage or deterioration. However, some minor cracks were observed in the concrete walls on the lower levels, which may indicate settlement or age-related stress.

Electrical: The electrical system is outdated and does not comply with current safety standards. Older wiring materials, such as rubber-insulated cables, were found throughout the building.

Plumbing: The plumbing system appears functional but shows signs of aging. Some minor leaks were detected in the hot water pipes on the upper floors, which may indicate corrosion or deterioration over time.

HVAC: The heating and ventilation systems are original to the building and require replacement due to their age and inefficiency.

Fire Safety: Fire safety measures appear adequate for the building's construction era. However, the absence of a modern smoke detection system is concerning, especially given the building's height and potential occupancy levels.

Accessibility: The building does not meet current accessibility standards, with no elevator access to upper floors and narrow staircases that may pose challenges for individuals with mobility impairments.

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

1. Upgrade the electrical system to comply with current safety standards.
2. Address the observed cracks in concrete walls, as they may indicate structural issues.
3. Repair or replace the leaking hot water pipes on upper floors.
4. Replace the outdated HVAC systems with more energy-efficient models.
5. Install a modern smoke detection system to improve fire safety.
6. Implement accessibility improvements, such as installing an elevator and widening staircases, to meet current standards.

**6. Compliance Summary**

The building does not comply with current Finnish building codes in several areas, including electrical wiring, plumbing, HVAC systems, fire safety measures, and accessibility.

**7. Conclusion**

Overall, the building appears structurally sound but requires significant renovations to bring it up to modern standards. It is recommended that the property owner address the identified issues in a timely manner to ensure the safety and accessibility of the building for future occupants.
