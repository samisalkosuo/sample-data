Structural: The building appears stable, with no visible signs of significant structural issues. However, some minor cracking in the concrete walls and floors was observed, which may indicate potential water penetration or settlement concerns.

Electrical: The electrical system appears to be original and shows signs of aging. Some outdated wiring and fuse boxes were noted, as well as a lack of ground fault circuit interrupters (GFCIs) in areas prone to moisture.

Plumbing: The plumbing system is functional but shows signs of wear and tear. Rust stains were observed on several fixtures, indicating potential water quality issues or corrosion within the pipes.

HVAC: The heating and cooling systems appear to be original and in need of replacement. The boiler and air conditioning units are outdated, inefficient, and may require costly repairs or upgrades.

Fire Safety: Fire safety measures appear adequate for the building's age, with smoke detectors and fire extinguishers present on each floor. However, some fire doors were found to be damaged or propped open, reducing their effectiveness in case of emergency.

Accessibility: The building does not meet modern accessibility standards, as there are no elevators and the staircases have narrow steps and handrails that may pose difficulties for individuals with mobility impairments.

Overall, the building is in fair condition considering its age. However, several issues were identified that need immediate attention to maintain safety, comfort, and accessibility for residents.
