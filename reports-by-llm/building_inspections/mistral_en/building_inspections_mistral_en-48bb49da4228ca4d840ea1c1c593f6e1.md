 **Building Inspection Report**

**1. General Information**

Country: Finland
Municipality: Eura
Address: Kauppakatu 23, 28600 Eura
Inspection Date: 07.06.2025
Inspector Name: Jari Koskela

**2. Building Overview**

Building Type: Commercial (retail store)
Construction Year: 1997
Number of Floors: Three (3)
Primary Materials: Reinforced concrete, brick, and aluminum cladding

**3. Inspection Context**

Weather Conditions: Overcast skies with occasional light rain, temperature 15°C (59°F), humidity 70%. The inspection was conducted for a routine check to ensure compliance with local building codes.

**4. Observations and Findings**

Structural: The structure appears stable and well-maintained, with no signs of significant settlement or distortion. However, minor cracks were observed in the concrete walls on the ground floor, which may indicate potential water intrusion issues.

Electrical: The electrical system appears to be functional and up-to-date, with no visible hazards. The wiring is mostly concealed within walls and ceilings, making a thorough assessment difficult without further investigation.

Plumbing: The plumbing system appears to be in good condition, with no leaks or signs of water damage observed during the inspection. However, the age of the building may warrant a more detailed examination of the pipes and fixtures.

HVAC: The heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems appear functional and well-maintained. The rooftop units were inspected from ground level due to safety concerns; a follow-up inspection may be necessary for a comprehensive assessment.

Fire Safety: Fire extinguishers are present on each floor, and the building's fire alarm system appears to be operational. However, the absence of a sprinkler system in the building is concerning, given its age and commercial use.

Accessibility: The building has one entrance with a single set of automatic doors, which provides adequate access for individuals using wheelchairs or strollers. However, the lack of accessible restrooms may require attention to ensure compliance with current regulations.

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

1. Investigate and repair any water intrusion issues causing cracks in concrete walls on the ground floor.
2. Conduct a thorough electrical system assessment, including wiring inspections within walls and ceilings.
3. Consider replacing or upgrading the building's plumbing system to ensure longevity and efficiency.
4. Schedule a follow-up inspection to assess the condition of rooftop HVAC units.
5. Install a sprinkler system to improve fire safety in the building.
6. Provide accessible restrooms for individuals with disabilities to meet current regulations.

**6. Compliance Summary**

The building generally complies with local building codes, but several areas require attention to ensure continued compliance and safety. The absence of a sprinkler system is particularly concerning given the building's age and commercial use.

**7. Conclusion**

Overall, the building appears to be in fair condition for its age. However, several issues were identified that warrant immediate attention to maintain the building's structural integrity and ensure compliance with local regulations. A follow-up inspection may be necessary to assess the progress of recommended repairs and upgrades.
