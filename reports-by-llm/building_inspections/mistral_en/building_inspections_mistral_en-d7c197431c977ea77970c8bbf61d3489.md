Plumbing: The plumbing system appears functional, with no leaks or significant water damage observed during the inspection. Some sections of the piping are original and may benefit from replacement during the renovation.

HVAC: The building's heating and ventilation systems appear to be in good working order. However, some components, such as the boiler and air handling units, are reaching the end of their service life and should be replaced during the renovation.

Fire Safety: The building has a fire sprinkler system installed, which is in good working condition. Fire doors and smoke detectors were found to be functional.
