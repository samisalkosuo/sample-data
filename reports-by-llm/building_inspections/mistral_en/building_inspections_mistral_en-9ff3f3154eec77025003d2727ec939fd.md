Structural: The building appears stable with no visible signs of structural damage or deterioration. However, some minor cracks were observed on the exterior walls, which may indicate settlement or age-related issues.

Plumbing: The plumbing system functions adequately, but some minor leaks were found around the base of the toilets and under the sinks in the kitchen and bathrooms. These issues may be due to worn-out seals or aging pipes.

HVAC: The heating and cooling systems are functioning as expected. However, the furnace is nearing its 25th year of service and may require maintenance or replacement soon.

Accessibility: The building has no accessibility issues for able-bodied individuals, but it may pose challenges for those with mobility impairments due to the lack of an elevator and narrow staircases.
