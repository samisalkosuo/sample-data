Country: Finland
Municipality: Lieksa
Address: Mannerheimintie 42 A, 87600 Lieksa
Inspection Date: 29.08.2024
Inspector Name: Juhani Kivinen

**2. Building Overview**

Building Type: Commercial (retail store)
Construction Year: 2008
Number of Floors: Three (3)
Primary Materials: Reinforced concrete, steel, and glazed glass facade

**3. Inspection Context**

Weather Conditions: Clear skies with temperatures around 15°C (59°F), light winds from the northwest. The inspection was conducted as part of a routine check to ensure compliance with local building codes.

**4. Observations and Findings**

Structural: The building's structural integrity appears sound, with no visible signs of distress or deterioration. However, minor cracks were observed in the concrete walls on the ground floor, which may indicate potential water intrusion issues.

Electrical: The electrical system appears to be functioning correctly, with no apparent hazards or code violations. The distribution panel was found to be well-maintained and labeled appropriately.

Plumbing: The plumbing system is in good condition overall. Minor leaks were detected around the sinks in the restrooms on the first and second floors, which may indicate a need for sealant replacement or potential pipe corrosion.

HVAC: The heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems are functioning as intended. However, some ductwork on the roof exhibited signs of condensation buildup, which could lead to mold growth if not addressed promptly.

Fire Safety: Fire safety equipment, including smoke detectors, fire extinguishers, and emergency exit signs, were found to be in good working order. The building's fire separation walls and doors appear adequate, but further investigation is needed to ensure compliance with current fire codes.

Accessibility: The commercial space meets the minimum accessibility requirements for people with disabilities, with ramps at the entrance and accessible restrooms on the ground floor. However, the lack of an elevator may pose challenges for individuals with mobility impairments accessing the upper floors.

**5. Identified Issues and Recommendations**

1. Investigate and repair minor cracks in concrete walls to prevent potential water intrusion issues.
2. Inspect and address any pipe corrosion caused by leaks around sinks in restrooms.
3. Clean and maintain ductwork on the roof to prevent condensation buildup and mold growth.
4. Review fire safety measures to ensure compliance with current building codes, particularly regarding fire separation walls and doors.
5. Consider installing an elevator to improve accessibility for individuals with mobility impairments.

**6. Compliance Summary**

The building generally complies with local building regulations, but there are areas that require attention to ensure continued compliance as codes evolve over time.

**7. Conclusion**

Overall, the commercial building in question is in fair condition and meets most current building code requirements. However, it is essential to address the identified issues promptly to maintain the building's structural integrity and ensure accessibility for all users. A follow-up inspection will be scheduled within six months to verify that the recommended repairs have been completed.
