Construction Year: 1984
Number of Floors: 3
Primary Materials: Reinforced concrete, brick, and timber frame construction with a tiled roof.

**3. Inspection Context**

Weather Conditions: Clear skies with temperatures around 15째C (59째F), ideal for exterior inspection. The purpose of this inspection was to assess the building's condition prior to potential renovation works.

**4. Observations and Findings**

Structural: The building appears stable, with no visible signs of significant structural issues. However, minor cracks were observed in some interior walls, which may indicate settlement or shrinkage over time.

Electrical: The electrical system appears to be original and functional, but the age of the wiring raises concerns about potential safety hazards. No obvious issues were found during this inspection.

Plumbing: The plumbing system is in fair condition, with no leaks observed during the inspection. However, some signs of corrosion were noted on exposed pipes, which may indicate the need for maintenance or replacement in the future.

HVAC: The heating and cooling systems appear to be functioning properly, but the age of the equipment suggests that it may require maintenance or replacement soon.

Fire Safety: Adequate smoke detectors and fire extinguishers were found throughout the building. However, the absence of a sprinkler system in this pre-1990s construction could be a concern for insurance purposes.

Accessibility: The three-story dwelling does not have an elevator, making it difficult for individuals with mobility impairments to access all floors.
