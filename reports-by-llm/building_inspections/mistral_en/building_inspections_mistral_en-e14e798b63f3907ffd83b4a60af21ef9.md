Structural: The building appears stable, but signs of aging are evident in some areas, such as minor cracking in concrete walls and floors. No significant structural issues were found that would compromise the safety of the occupants.

Electrical: The electrical system is outdated, with wiring primarily consisting of aluminum conduit and knob-and-tube wiring. While functional, an upgrade to modern copper wiring and circuit breakers is recommended for improved safety and efficiency.

Plumbing: The plumbing system appears to be in good condition, with no leaks or signs of water damage observed during the inspection. However, some galvanized steel pipes may need replacement due to corrosion over time.

HVAC: The heating system consists of individual apartment-level radiators and a central boiler. Insulation levels appear adequate, but further investigation is needed to determine if energy efficiency upgrades are necessary.

Fire Safety: Smoke detectors and fire extinguishers are present in each unit, but some units lack functioning carbon monoxide detectors. A comprehensive review of the building's fire safety measures is recommended.

Accessibility: The building does not have any elevators, making it difficult for individuals with mobility impairments to access upper floors. Consideration should be given to installing an elevator during any future renovations.
